# The Principles of Rise and Fall of Chinese Civilization  

From a more macro perspective, the law of imperial rise and fall is essentially the law of civilizational rise and fall. When we align this law with the developmental trajectory of Chinese civilization, we can deduce more intriguing conclusions.  

## The Prematurity of Chinese Civilization  

The Chinese nation may seem to have lagged behind or declined in its evolutionary process. However, this is not the case. More accurately, the evolutionary process of the Chinese nation is more akin to being "ahead of its time" or "premature." The Legalism represented by Han Feizi finds a Western counterpart in Machiavelli's *The Prince*. Both advocate prioritizing national interests—sacrificing the interests of the people domestically and neighboring states internationally—all in pursuit of survival and victory in brutal group competition. By comparing the historical timelines of these analogous ideologies, we can infer that the period of acute group conflict in Europe lagged behind that of the Chinese nation by over a millennium. The period of corruption among Europe's new ethnic groups (relative to the Romans and earlier peoples) also arrived much later than in the Chinese nation. It was not until Machiavelli's era that Westerners truly perceived the decline of morality and the fragility and danger of goodwill. In *The Prince*, Machiavelli wrote: ["There is such a gap between how men actually live and how they ought to live that anyone who abandons what is for what should be pursues his downfall rather than his preservation. For a man who wants to act virtuously in every way will come to ruin among so many who are not virtuous."]() This statement is evidently another version of the Altruism Paradox. It implies that in earlier times, people could act according to what they believed they "ought" to do—following universal morality—but by Machiavelli's era, such ideals had become unattainable. In contrast, the Chinese nation had already seen Confucius lament "the decay of human hearts" during the Spring and Autumn Period. Xunzi, who posited the inherent evil of human nature, and later the Legalists who radicalized this concept, emerged as early as the Warring States Period. Han Feizi's assertions, such as "If even one's wife and children cannot be trusted, then no one else can be trusted," are more radical than Machiavelli's similar claims—surely even Machiavelli would have marveled at them.  

Following the trajectory of Legalism, we observe that several hundred years later, during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, these pragmatic imperial tactics were further "developed." Su Chuo, a statesman from a generations-old official family, compiled the *Treatise on Appointing Officials* (some argue it was pseudepigraphical, but such thinking did not arise from nowhere and was evident in political struggles of the era). Su Chuo advised Yuwen Tai: To secure loyalty, you must offer benefits. Yet with the state impoverished, you lack the resources to buy hearts directly. Thus, instead of material rewards, grant officials power—allow them to embezzle and exploit the people through their authority. Officials can amass wealth by extorting the people, but since this power originates from you, Yuwen Tai, they will be grateful and loyal, effectively "bought" by you. The benefits are clear: On one hand, officials gain advantages, trading their loyalty to Yuwen Tai; on the other, corruption leaves officials with "leverage" in Yuwen Tai's hands, making them easier to control. Su Chuo further noted that corrupt officials are often more useful than virtuous ones. Corrupt officials, fearing exposure of their misdeeds, cling to Yuwen Tai; virtuous officials, lacking such leverage, are more principled and may oppose Yuwen Tai to protect the people, showing less fear or loyalty.  

However, rampant corruption risks inciting popular uprisings. Thus, Su Chuo provided countermeasures: When corruption does not yet threaten Yuwen Tai's authority, he should periodically issue decrees "condemning corruption" and "punishing corrupt officials," selectively targeting a few. This serves dual purposes: It assures the people that Yuwen Tai is virtuous and abhors corruption (blaming corruption on individual officials, thereby diverting popular resentment toward officials and increasing support for Yuwen Tai); and it allows Yuwen Tai to suppress dissidents under the guise of anti-corruption. Additionally, constant talk of cracking down on corruption keeps officials with "leverage" in line, as they fear becoming targets, compelling greater loyalty to secure Yuwen Tai's "mercy." Su Chuo emphasized, "Virtuous officials cannot provide these benefits," nor does killing them yield gains. Executing virtuous officials, who enjoy public respect, would lose popular support; moreover, virtuous officials are rarely wealthy, so their execution yields no profit.  

This theory spreads with natural inevitability. For instance, if Prince A rejects such tactics, the theory will be introduced to Prince B, who will more easily gain power, secure support, and usurp the throne. Thus, B淘汰A (B eliminates A), and Reverse Selection occurs. Why did barbarian groups, after sinicization, often rapidly enter a period of decline? A key reason is their adoption of Han Chinese pragmatic governance philosophy. Initially, this philosophy proves effective for seizing power, but it acts like poison: It erodes virtuous talent, undermines the Virtue Selection mechanism, and nurtures hordes of hypocrites—many from the aristocratic families of previous dynasties. This sinicization process rapidly propels barbarian groups into a post-evolutionary phase, entering the next cycle of the Law of Historical Cycles.  

In fact, the evolutionary stage of Chinese official politics far outpaces that of the West. Recalling our analysis of the French Revolution in the previous chapter, even though that period marked deepening Hypocrisyism for the West, we still witnessed "hypocritical" idealists. Power struggles within Chinese imperial dynasties were evidently premature by millennia compared to the West—even the infighting during the decline of Chinese dynasties overshadows Western counterparts. Whether the Rebellion of the Eight Princes, the political interference of Empress Wu Zetian, Empress Wei, and Princess Taiping, the factional strife at the end of the Southern Song, or the party struggles at the end of the Ming Dynasty—none find comparable intensity in world history. This infighting, marked by increasing levels of duplicity and cunning, resembles a high-stakes game of *Werewolf*, where everyone is suspicious of others, focused only on self-preservation, with no time or inclination to plan for the nation or people. There is no commitment, no trust—only individual interests. These power struggles ultimately lead to catastrophic, generational collapses of Chinese dynasties—"generational" meaning the Chinese nation suffers severe blows, entering a period of major reorganization.  

In relative terms, Chinese civilization is indeed premature. This aligns with geographical laws and the timing of civilizational formation. Europe, after the fall of the Roman people, developed a commercial civilization led by northern barbarians; Chinese civilization, an older riverine agricultural civilization, has higher population concentration than commercial civilizations, exacerbating issues of cooperative hypocrisy among individuals. In fact, other riverine civilizations worldwide have already declined due to intensification, and many once-glorious human groups have vanished from history. Chinese civilization is a post-evolutionary civilization—many political ideas emerged later, such as the distinct ethos of the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang, Zhou) differing from later eras. The current cooperative dilemma of Chinese civilization actually reflects the future evolutionary trajectory of Western civilization. We must not underestimate the inevitability of Adversarial Evolution. I believe that if Western civilization survives its long period of corruption, the root causes of its decline will mirror those plaguing Chinese civilization today.  

The Chinese nation achieved unification millennia earlier than Europe's emerging unified states. It has endured longer periods of corruption than any other people, with these periods cycling repeatedly—an unparalleled phenomenon in human history. Like an elderly person long afflicted with cancer, often weak and once labeled the "Sick Man of East Asia," the Chinese nation has, through innumerable trials, still ignited unimaginable vitality and resilience. Unlike most cancer patients, who rapidly perish as cancer metastasizes, the Chinese nation, even with cancer cells deeply entrenched and after countless dynastic changes and full-scale metastasis, has still miraculously revived. A prime example is the inspiring history of the founding of our Party, which reflects the miraculous vitality exclusive to Four-Dimensional Life Forms. That such vitality emerges in an ancient, decrepit, and ailing nation astounds even those well-versed in Adversarial Evolution.

The moral instincts of individuals serve as a reliable measure of the degree of corruption within a human community. At the dawn of a community's rise, the vast majority of individuals possess exemplary moral character—one might almost say "human nature is inherently virtuous." As time progresses, however, and the community grows to a scale where its original cooperative mechanisms can no longer contain the emergence and spread of "cancerous cells" (Individual Cancerization), corruption creeps in. Eventually, people come to lament, "the world is not what it used to be," and it becomes increasingly evident that "human nature is inherently evil" aligns more closely with reality than "human nature is inherently good." [From this perspective, using the average measure of human virtue and evil to gauge the "aging" of a human symbiotic community is a highly scientific approach.]()  

### The Multitude of Heroic Spirits in the Chinese Nation—The Backbone Sustaining a Millennium-Old Civilization  

Having endured millennia of tribulation, injustice, subjugation, and inequality, the Chinese nation might have been expected to degrade toward grabbingism at an accelerated pace, much as the once-glorious Romans around the Mediterranean degenerated into irrelevance after total corruption. Yet the Chinese nation has miraculously risen repeatedly, particularly in modern times, emerging from foreign subjugation with a more unified four-dimensional life form (Four-Dimensional Life Form) and an unprecedented collective awakening. This has given birth to countless great individuals—heroes whose high-dimensional consciousness (Consciousness of High-Dimensional Life) is rare, even unparalleled, in global human history. The sum of great figures in Stefan Zweig’s *Sternstunden der Menschheit* (Hours of Glory) pales in comparison to the mere fraction of heroes in China’s five-thousand-year history.  

In the eyes of foreign observers, great figures are often those who achieve extraordinary personal feats. Yet the Chinese nation’s heroes possess not only exceptional individual capabilities but also a profound awakening to the self-consciousness of four-dimensional life. Driven by this consciousness, they have created immense value for the nation and its people. ["Self-sacrificing-for-the-community genes are the result of mutual-benefit-and-win-win genes evolving toward greater collectivity; the cooperative dividends they generate represent a qualitative leap."]()  

As an ancient and successful civilization, the Chinese nation has long evolved individuals with an intense self-sacrificing-for-the-community spirit. Whether "sacrificing life for benevolence" or "giving up life for righteousness," their figures grace every page of Chinese history. Externally, there are military heroes like Yue Fei, Lu Xiufu, Qi Jiguang, Yuan Chonghuan, Shi Kefa, Zhang Huangyan, and Lin Zexu—generals who, at the nation’s brink of collapse, summoned indomitable strength, endured personal injustice, and fought unyieldingly until their last breath. Internally, there are statesmen like Fan Zhongyan, Wen Tianxiang, Yu Qian, and Zhang Juzheng—ministers who, amid national crises, turned the tide and propped up the crumbling edifice. There are also poetic souls like Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Lu You, Xin Qiji, and Gu Yanwu—though their grand ambitions went unfulfilled, their verses, which embody the awakening of high-dimensional life, have been passed down through the ages.  

In modern history, as the nation faced existential threats and clearer paths to salvation emerged, these heroic spirits converged more densely than in any prior era. Names like Tan Sitong, Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, Li Dazhao, Yun Daiying, Qu Qiubai, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De form a list longer than that of any other era or civilization in human history. This is the profound legacy of the Chinese nation.  

"Hooves thunder southward; men gaze north. Dragon banners flutter; horses neigh; sword qi chills the air. Why fear death to repay the nation? Countless loyal souls lie buried far from home." The Chinese nation, upheld by these great loyal spirits, has fluctuated through its extraordinarily long historical river yet remains standing firm. The Chinese people are blessed with extraordinary individuals—self-sacrificing heroes whose loyalty and capability are unmatched in global annals.  

Take Bruno, martyred for truth by fire, and compare him to Yuan Chonghuan, who was executed by the very people he fought to protect. Bruno’s death was a glorious sacrifice for truth; Yuan’s was a tragic end—a man who dedicated his life to battling enemies, only to be suspected, slandered, and subjected to more brutal punishment than even the foe by his own people, the nation he served, and the emperor he loyalized. Yet even as the community fell ill, grew delusional, and turned on itself, these heroes remained steadfast, toiling until their last breath. What is most poignant is that it was their former adversaries—the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty—who, moved by their courage and righteousness, eventually vindicated them.  

These heroes transcend dynasties and ethnicities; they serve not a single family or lineage but the high-dimensional life of the entire Chinese nation. Their spirit transcends geography and time, converging into the core ethos of the Chinese people. Even their enemies have been awed by their greatness, and subsequent dynasties have honored them with posthumous titles. Fan Zhongyan’s line, "Worry before the world worries; joy after the world joys," has endured through the ages, epitomizing the awakening of high-dimensional life consciousness. In his *Ode to the Spiritual Bird*, he incisively explains why humanity needs high-dimensional awareness:  

"Why not learn from the granary rat, who cares not for benevolence, feasting to grow fat? Yet if the granary is emptied, where will it go? Why not learn from the wild fox, who cares not for righteousness, burrowing deep for power? Yet if the wall collapses, on what will it depend?"  

This reflects the foresightedness (Foresightedness) of high-dimensional life—they see the city of the future, care for future generations, and labor to secure the longevity of their genes and the well-being of the high-dimensional life form.  

The Chinese nation, as a high-dimensional life form, coalesces around these heroes, who form its true spiritual and physical backbone. Even when this ancient giant has been marred by tumors and weakened, as long as these heroes exist, it will not easily fall; it will retain the chance to rejuvenate and be reborn.  

The Chinese nation, with its long and calamitous history, has thus evolved individuals who "sacrifice self for the community" in times of crisis. Shielded by their spirit, the Chinese people pioneered a brilliant civilization amid innumerable trials and remain standing among the world’s nations today.  

Self-sacrificing heroes have existed since antiquity, and during modern history and the War of Resistance against Japan, such figures reemerged to save the nation. Qiu Shaoyun, Dong Cunrui, Wang Jiguang, Liu Hulan, Wang Erxiao are but a fraction of those we know; countless unnamed heroes remain unrecorded. They are the backbone of our nation. Without them, the Chinese people would have been trampled by foreign powers, never to rise again.  

Surveying all of human history, one struggles to find a nation with as many, as capable, and as deeply self-sacrificing individuals as the Chinese. Their high-dimensional consciousness can be glimpsed in the verses of heroes through the ages:

Indeed, the Chinese nation has already established the highest-dimensional life form, when considered from the perspectives of instinct and morality, in all human civilizational history up to this point. We pay tribute to the great spirits of the Chinese nation over the past five thousand years and the next fifty thousand.  

## The Chinese Nation Abounds with Petty Figures—Great Corruption Supported by Great Cooperation  

A sharp, unavoidable question arises: *“If the Chinese nation has produced so many high-dimensionally awakened heroes, why did it fall behind so swiftly in modern history, with civilizational achievements less prominent than the West?”* Without clarifying this, all prior conclusions will contradict themselves and collapse. If “self-sacrificing-for-the-group” genes are an evolved version of “mutually beneficial” genes, then “harmful-to-others-for-selfish-gain” genes, degenerating along the path of grabbing, will spawn “harmful-to-the-group-for-selfish-gain” genes—even “harmful-to-both-group-and-self” behaviors to topple political rivals, seeking fleeting dominance. The greater the vision of grand heroes, the more base and short-sighted the parasitic petty figures. The stronger the ability and resolve of self-sacrificing individuals, the greater the cooperative dividends they generate. Thus, the “sheltered” petty figures have more latitude and margin to harm the group for personal gain; the more龌龊 and unprincipled the petty figures, the more they dominate internal competition. They squander the cooperative dividends created by self-sacrificing individuals until their grabbing deficits exceed the dividends, or they frame and kill the self-sacrificers, dissipating the dividends and destroying their own foundations. These petty figures perish alongside the collapsing high-dimensional life form.  

*Thus, a community’s capacity to tolerate extreme petty figures reflects the greatness of its heroes.*  

This logic is not hard to grasp. Take self-sacrificing individuals: if a group produces a Dong Cunrui, who uses his body to block a bunker, buying time for his comrades and preventing greater casualties, such a group releases immense cooperative dividends. Heroes like Yue Fei, Zhang Juzheng, Yuan Chonghuan, Sun Yat-sen, and Mao Zedong have, in different eras, turned the tide. Their personal capabilities and deeds are unparalleled even in global history.  

*The stronger the cooperative abilities of these self-sacrificing individuals, the greater the cooperative dividends; the higher the group’s tolerance for grabbing deficits, the longer and deeper the corruption.*  

In most historical periods, if petty figures retained even a sliver of conscience, a trace of group awareness—if they did not fixate solely on immediate gains and perceived rivals, ignoring national interests—the Chinese nation would have avoided countless calamities.  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6d0b55-0206-402f-adaa-97c9c64475fc" /></p>  

The Chinese nation’s issues do not stem from its inner core—the quality of its essential people. On the contrary, its core heroes possess higher-dimensional awakening than those of most successful nations. The problem lies in the corrupted outer layers propped up by this great core. When you see Chinese people of poor character, selfishness, hypocrisy, servility, sycophancy, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, or disunity—*strictly speaking, these are not true Chinese, but “Chinese tumors.”*  

The Chinese have long valued virtue. Those of poor moral character face significant life difficulties and reduced fitness under the “Virtue Selection” mechanism—a positive trend. Yet precisely because the Chinese are attentive to others’ virtues, hypocritical individuals have been selected. These hypocrites are nearly indistinguishable; they have overfit humanity’s innate moral judgment.  

### Two Typical Malignant Growths in the Great Corruption Period  

In this section, I attempt a relatively systematic and quantitative analysis of dark human nature, aiming to inspire further research. Only by understanding our adversaries can we hope to triumph.  

#### Sophisticated Egoists (Covert NPD, Servile Personalities)  

Great cooperation supports great corruption, giving rise to two types of “tumors” among the Chinese:  

*First, sophisticated egoists. These individuals may appear harmless, easily masquerading as gentlemen or gentlewomen when profit is at stake. But when real interests emerge or a partner loses utility, they shed their disguise, transforming utterly. Unbound by principle or conscience, they pursue trivial gains at the expense of the whole, nitpicking and insatiable.*  

These are greedy utilitarians, seeking advantage in every detail. They carry servility—rarely revealing their true faces publicly, fearing social ruin, and even cowering before power. Instead, they target kin and good-hearted individuals—those they deem “easy to exploit”—for grabbing. They are key accomplices and drivers of the Reverse Selection phenomenon.  

*These individuals often excel at early-stage伪装 (camouflage), behaving more “normal” than average. They appear polite, cautious, even innocent; some are calculating, adept at catering to others’ preferences and providing emotional value. Their true nature surfaces only later.*  

They rarely violate hard laws or exhibit overt immorality, yet they lack genuine morality, disregarding justice, fairness, and equity. Shameless and self-serving, their inner scales tilt heavily toward themselves, craving far more than their due.  

*Seemingly harmless in daily life, their true nature emerges in the face of利益 (interests). They devise every means to maximize personal gain, ignoring fairness, and are willing to sacrifice massive collective interests to secure a marginal advantage. They care not if partners suffer great losses.*  

Once exposed, they create “Rashomon” narratives to confuse others, turning cold and ungrateful, changing abruptly. They excel at self-deception, constructing superficially moral justifications oriented toward favorable outcomes, leaving outsiders uncertain.  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b865ab78-4654-4675-b5a9-c7cc50c3f6ba" /></p>  
<p align="center">The mindset of normal reciprocal cooperators</p>  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b71da80b-3cdb-474f-848d-ffe038e032a0" /></p>  
<p align="center">The mindset of narcissistic disordered egoists</p>  

In cooperation, they typify ingratitude—quietly demanding while grudgingly giving. *Fundamentally, they care only about personal gain, not collective maximization. They deny past benefits from the relationship, refuse to “lose” at any step, and seek advantage in nearly every communal action. Thus, they often make one-sided demands; when rejected, they harbor resentment.*  

Before interests, they spare no effort to trap partners in injustice, destroy cooperation, and act unyielding, unfeeling, and short-sighted—slaves to profit.

When attempting to reason with individuals of this type, it proves futile. When you broach the first issue, they deflect to the tenth; when you address the tenth, they shift to the hundredth. [Once their argument in one instance is refuted, they immediately redirect the conversation to another event that might advantage them or allow them to denigrate you, as if the prior point had never been discredited. They thus delusionally construct the rationality of their grabbing behavior through self-deception.] Even after all their justifications are dismantled, they remain unperturbed, unchanged. Moreover, they employ anger as a tool for emotional manipulation—when making utterly unreasonable and illogical demands, they do so with accusatory force, [projecting an air of unassailable righteousness, though their demands may in fact be entirely unwarranted.] Well-meaning, self-reflective individuals may fall into self-doubt, for this incredulous reaction easily leads one to question their own fault. In reality, it is a form of self-deceptive PUA (Pick-Up Artist) manipulation. Strikingly, these tactics stem almost entirely from instinct, requiring no deliberate, learned strategy—making them all the more critical to discern. The incident of a female internet influencer verbally abusing a nurse in Singapore exemplifies this obstinate sophistry through her exchanges with investigators. Such obfuscation drastically escalates the time and human costs of upholding Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. [Furthermore, these individuals are generally impervious to moral instruction. Selfishness and hypocrisy form an unyielding barrier within their psyche, manifesting externally as extreme stubbornness and self-righteousness—reason falls on deaf ears, disputes are shunned, and faults are never acknowledged, colloquially termed "strong shielding ability." This barrier blocks all positive reasoning. It is not a lack of rational capacity, but rather that instinct and nature take primacy when faced with a situation. Their true essence is self-serving, yet they cannot openly admit it; thus, when all excuses are exhausted, they cling to defiance. Conscience and justice are treated as filth in their hearts.] Driven by greed or unease, they refuse to assume rightful responsibilities, seizing every available pretext with self-centered tenacity to avoid even the slightest concession. Their sophistry can be illustrated simply: for instance, they might claim "time is life" and "life is priceless," then argue that the time they invested in a matter is therefore priceless. Yet when others have spent ten times the time—and crucially, ten times the effort and energy—on the same task, they insist the results should be split equally, asserting all contributions are "priceless." Conversely, in other distributive contexts, they adopt diametrically opposed logic to diminish the value of others' time. [This self-centered, unyielding, and self-justifying behavioral pattern, which seeks advantage in every situation, may partially guard against PUA and moral persuasion, yet often succumbs to Ponzi Schemes that dangle small gains to entrap larger ones.] They fundamentally disregard others' labor and achievements. To rationalize their distrust, they project their own malicious intent onto others, distorting the goodwill of others to lay psychological groundwork for subsequent grabbing behavior. A hundred acts of kindness or a hundredfold effort on their behalf will be overshadowed by a single shortcoming, which they magnify and dwell on indefinitely. Conversely, a single act of kindness on their part becomes a recurring justification to evade gratitude. They practice "repaying a kindness as vast as a spring with a trickle," or even repaying kindness with enmity. [They grossly exaggerate their own contributions while minimizing others', blinded by bias, practicing extreme double standards and partiality, lacking empathy and gratitude, often consumed by envy. They distort others' goodwill with malicious interpretations, using this to excuse ingratitude, twist facts, and convince themselves: "Others have wronged me, not the other way around."] Their double standards further manifest in their unashamed acceptance of favors—they feel entitled to siphon benefits from cooperative individuals. Yet when called to reciprocate or fulfill their responsibilities, they turn miserly, ungrateful, obstinate, and unrecognizable. In communication, they ceaselessly defend themselves with excuses; when one is refuted, they pivot to another. Lacking reasons, they attack others to deflect, unconcerned with logical coherence or fairness. [What matters is refusing to concede, never admitting fault, and never repenting.] Finally, when all reasons and excuses are exhausted, they fall silent, unchanged. Many of these individuals align closely with the psychological definition of Covert Narcissism (a subtype of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, NPD), harboring inflated self-worth, devaluing others, often envious or convinced of being envied—yet concealing these self-centered tendencies. Initially, they may even appear more "normal" than average, exuding warmth, humility, politeness, and steadiness. Some resemble the "servile personality" described by Lu Xun; as Mo Yan aptly noted: "The ugliness of human nature lies in nitpicking at the powerless, kind, and fault-finding with the powerful, unvirtuous." Tragically, [when confronting servile personalities, one can only treat them as such—only then do they "function" as intended, compelling others to dominate and manipulate them.] Their benefits must be doled out gradually; given all at once, they quickly discard their benefactors, showing no gratitude even for great gains, yet coveting even small, unfulfilled benefits. Their nature—bullying the meek and kowtowing to bluster and false authority—drives them to exploit the gentle and submit to pretentious dominance. Thus, servile personalities "select" those who employ manipulation, bluster, and pretense. Most adhere to a philosophy of never losing out (some feign generosity with small favors in the early stages), a mindset shaped by the harsh reality that those willing to accept small losses or trust others often fare poorly. Their unwavering stance—either taking advantage or breaking ties, never suffering the slightest loss, and remaining indifferent to cooperative dividends—paradoxically shields them from countless petty scams. The complex evolutionary causes and manifestations of such "refined egoists" are intricate. [They represent a challenging, cancerous subtype of grabbing degeneration and hypocrisy within the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism system. Through the lens of Adversarial Evolution theory, we can even trace how those who proactively cooperate, concede benefits, and extend goodwill have been gradually eliminated by fraudsters and hypocrites over history—a silent, unprecedentedly large-scale war that evokes profound lament.] [This is the result of centuries of distorted Confucian culture, which, through moral persuasion and instruction, compelled self-reflective "noblemen" to make concessions and compromises, only to be "reverse-selected" and displaced.] [To some extent, because these servile individuals have lost the capacity for reason and moral persuasion, leaving only the fear of having their interests and personhood dominated by power, this has given rise to Legalism, the "thick-black school" (Machiavellian tactics), and PUA, as well as a second category of individuals. All of this aligns with the laws of Adversarial Evolution.]

#### Great Deceivers Appearing as Loyal Ones  
The second "malignant tumor" is the Great Deceiver. [More patient than the first type—who seeks immediate advantage in every interaction—they often offer small favors or employ long-term schemes, acting as masterminds behind various Ponzi Schemes.] They present as cultured, generous, and empathetic, [skilled at providing cheap emotional validation, with deception as their innate ability.] Their apparent generosity lures the first type into believing they’ve encountered a "genuine honest person," prompting eager exploitation. Yet Great Deceivers are playing the long game, rarely offering tangible, convertible value. [They shrewdly exploit the first type’s greed for small gains, desire for unearned benefits, and craving for more than their due—whether in emotion or money.] Through flattery, sweet talk, false empathy, and emotional validation, they gradually build trust, enthralling the first type into investing money, time, and emotion in pursuit of illusory promises. These individuals are highly status-conscious, valuing their "power dynamic"; leveraging status to intimidate often yields disproportionate returns, making deception all the easier. Top-tier Great Deceivers sustain their lies indefinitely; most bide their time until their targets are drained, at which point their "predatory fangs" emerge. They may then sever ties or dangle false hope to continue exploitation. Often attractive, they employ the same tactics in romantic deception: offering initial favors, retreating when the target advances, advancing when the target retreats, using "push-pull" to create obsession, and gradually eroding the target’s boundaries until full control is achieved. Their methods are honed through deep Adversarial Evolution, making detection difficult. [For they subvert expectations where you least suspect—you might ask yourself, "Surely not? He wouldn’t deceive me to this extent; surely not manipulate me, given his apparent investment; surely not be so heartless."] Yet these are the most extreme hypocrites, defying ordinary expectations. There is a type of deception that leaves you unable to believe you’ve been deceived. They are hollow, lacking genuine emotion—or their emotions are deeply warped.

These two types of individuals are both Grabbingists. The first type gradually evolves into sycophants, while the second type gradually transforms into tyrants. When encountering the first type, one should learn to cut losses and distance oneself promptly; when facing the second type, one must avoid coveting small gains, resist believing in stories of speculative overnight riches, and steer clear of those who seem to act solely in your interest but subtly harm society. It is essential to adhere to the principle that only just, reasonable, and mutually beneficial gains constitute the sole correct path to profit.  

From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the first and second types of Grabbingists are actually mutually selected. They have engaged in countless games and confrontations throughout the history of a nation’s cancerization and decline. Owing to the first type’s miserliness and pettiness, they can consistently extract benefits from virtuous, generous collaborators. Over time, this dynamic of accumulation and attrition leads to the complete elimination of such generous collaborators. Meanwhile, the second type is selected by the first: because the first type covets small gains and disregards right and wrong, the second type lures them with minor benefits, gradually entrapping them until they become dependent. The first type often lacks rational capacity; their ability to present as morally upright while acting with cold, ruthless disregard for fairness in pursuit of profit stems from their knack for weaving self-deceptive justifications to rationalize their greed. The second type seizes upon this psychological vulnerability—the first type’s desire for unearned gains. In their repeated interactions with the second type, where they keep reaping small benefits, the first type’s own psychological mechanisms are triggered: as long as the hope of gaining an advantage persists, they remain trapped in greed, lose reason, and use self-made justifications to avoid confronting the reality of being deceived. It is precisely this susceptibility to the trap of coveting small gains that enables the proliferation of pyramid schemes and frauds, leaving onlookers astounded.  

At a deeper level, these two types of hypocritical Grabbingists are akin in nature: both are self-interested, lacking in empathy, and skilled at feigning virtue. Their underlying logic is one of conflicting and opposing interests; their mental inertia drives them to maximize personal gain rather than cooperative dividends. The only difference lies in their objective capabilities and influence, leading them to adopt outwardly distinct survival strategies.

### The Thousand-Layered Tactics of Evil Under Virtue Selection  
Since humanity established Virtue Selection mechanisms such as morality and law, overt evils like banditry, market bullying, and abduction have become increasingly unsustainable. Yet, the forces of evil have evolved toward greater subtlety, with certain tactics proving alarmingly effective. We must not only examine the warped minds behind these tactics but also the societal and psychological deficits that nourish them. By understanding the Adversarial Evolution and human nature underpinning these phenomena, we can grasp why such evil tactics persist, adapt, and intensify.  

#### Tactic 0 of Evil: The Ponzi Scheme—A Perennially Effective Stratagem  
The Ponzi Scheme is nearly the foundational tactic of all hypocritical evils. I contend that every individual in society is, at this very moment, being deceived to varying degrees by Ponzi Schemes in diverse forms. It rightfully claims the title of Evil’s “Tactic 0.” The scheme operates on the principles of “giving to take,” “feigning restraint to capture,” and “driving to madness before destruction.” Rooted in human weaknesses and unrecognized greed, the Ponzi Scheme is the ultimate tactic.  

Note that I refer here to a generalized Ponzi Scheme, extending far beyond financial P2P platforms and pyramids. It encompasses emotional deception, political manipulation, and frauds in medicine, employment, tourism, e-commerce, and more. The basic structure of a generalized Ponzi Scheme is illustrated below:  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d25b069-d3cf-450e-a698-6d06e88312e7" /></p>  

Broadly, the generalized Ponzi Scheme follows three phases: the Pie-Painting Phase, the Pie-Tasting Phase, and the Cliff Phase.  

In financial investments, this is well-documented. During the Pie-Painting Phase, a fantastical investment concept with exorbitant returns is fabricated. Initially, returns may seem plausible, and as investments grow, positive news amplifies, convincing victims of their astuteness. Partial withdrawals are allowed to validate the “reality” of the pie, enticing larger investments—often funded by borrowing. The Cliff Phase arrives when the schemer maximizes profit and flees, leaving late investors bankrupt or in debt.  

Emotional frauds follow a similar pattern. Men may deceive for affection; women, for wealth. Male emotional scams are particularly illustrative. In the Pie-Painting Phase, the deceiver displays fabricated strength and charm—pretending to be wealthy, well-connected, cultured, or mysterious—making the target feel they have “won” the relationship. During the Pie-Tasting Phase, they tailor their persona, shower gifts, manipulate emotions, or feign virtue, ensuring the target becomes infatuated. Post-entrapment, the deceiver gradually reveals their true self, escalating bad behavior to prepare for the Cliff Phase: a sudden breakup. The victim is left with lost time, money, and often, the burden of raising a child—having “lost both principal and interest.”  

Modern women are disproportionately affected. Such schemes often use flattery to coerce compliance. While initial instinct may help some avoid disaster, the unexposed “bubble” of the Ponzi Scheme leaves lingering impressions of high desirability, making it hard for women to accept genuine partners with “inferior” conditions. This filtering process leaves them vulnerable to repeated scams. It is not that warnings are absent or reason dormant; rather, instinct—even physiological preference—prevails. Hypocritical demons are adept at leveraging these genetic-level instincts, bypassing reason to secure dominance.  

This mirrors consumer behavior: once exposed to cheaper or superficially better options, we resist settling for less. Consequently, women are either trapped in the “Truman Show” of flattery crafted by the Ponzi Scheme or fall victim to it. No wonder many quip that modern wives are “won by deception”—and such unions are rife with resentment and rifts.  

Political Ponzi Schemes are equally prevalent, especially in elected governments. Notable examples include Italy’s National Fascist Party and Germany’s Nazi Party, which rose to power under the banners of “popular democracy” or “people’s interests.” Their leaders excelled at cultivating the image of saviors, understanding the importance of exploiting public weaknesses. As Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels noted: “Let the fire of passion burn forever—it warms and illuminates, creating the art of modern political propaganda. Rooted in the people, it must constantly return to its source. Power via rifle may suffice, but winning hearts is superior.” Germans, seduced by political pie-painting, descended into Nazism and WWII, gambling collectively and losing everything—principal and interest.  

Variants of the Ponzi Scheme pervade other sectors: health product scams in medicine, beauty frauds; job scams in education, “high-salary” offers, and “entrepreneurship” lures (leading to trafficking); “low-cost” tours with forced shopping; fake matchmaker services; fabricated celebrity personas; property scams over “planned amenities”; rental scams with hidden fees; and e-commerce frauds like low-quality goods, misleading product photos, and influencer scams. All follow the pattern of painting a pie, offering small benefits, seizing large gains, and abrupt collapse.  

Though its mechanics are well-known, the Ponzi Scheme remains alarmingly effective. In the post-market economy era, the theoretical framework of “free choice” is eroding. Underlying currents of Grabbingism have infiltrated industries and social activities with “tempting purchases,” constructing a “Truman Show” of superficial glamour and luxury that aligns with instinctive desires but hides pitfalls. The perception that “the world is a scam” arises because people crave more than they deserve—materially and emotionally—and reject pragmatic, equitable exchange. Choosing the alluring illusions crafted by adept deceivers inevitably leads to cliff-like losses.

In recent years, a new species of viper, the *spider-tailed horned viper* (Pseudocerastes urarachnoides), has been discovered in Iran. This viper's tail bears a striking resemblance to a large, plump spider. Many bird species prey on such insects, and although the spider mimicry produced by the spider-tailed horned viper is somewhat implausible—excessively plump and conspicuously swaying in exposed areas—hungry birds can scarcely resist this temptation. They rush toward the "spider" like moths to a flame. Yet who could have foreseen that their fate would not be a satisfying meal, but a sudden attack by the viper, which mimics the appearance of a rock, followed by being swallowed alive.

<p align="center">The spider-tailed horned viper lunges as a bird approaches its "spider tail"</p>  

The viper’s tactics follow the classic sequence of: painting a promising picture, offering a taste of benefits, and finally delivering a sudden, catastrophic reversal—no step is missing. If even creatures act this way, what of humans?  


### **Tactic of Evil 1: Covert Narcissism—Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing**  
Among the "sophisticated egoists" mentioned earlier, a common subtype is the *Covert Narcissism* personality, a quintessential example of Hypocrisyism. Let us elaborate further.  

Psychology defines *Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)* as a complex condition characterized by an inflated sense of self-worth. Paradoxically, beneath this grandiosity, narcissists often exhibit chronic low self-esteem. They fantasize about achievements, power, intelligence, and beauty; they grow intensely envious of those more successful. Their self-esteem is fragile, obsessed with others’ approval and constant admiration; criticism triggers inner rage and shame, masked outwardly by indifference. They lack empathy—an inability to understand others’ emotions. PUA (Pick-Up Artist) techniques are also a staple of NPD behavior, including push-pull manipulation, belittling, compliance testing (e.g., "calling a deer a horse" to demand blind agreement, feigning inattention to others’ words), triangulation (comparing one to more successful individuals to undermine confidence), and abrupt breakups.  

Unlike overt NPD, *Covert Narcissism* appears outwardly normal—especially in initial interactions, where they may even go out of their way to accommodate others. Yet they bury their self-centered traits deep, making them more insidious and harmful. Covert Narcissists likely constitute the majority of hypocritical personalities, as they often extract benefits from cooperative relationships, ultimately enhancing their genetic advantage.  

From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, Covert Narcissism is an effective means by which Hypocrisyism breaches moral constraints. Its typical traits include:  
1. **Refusal to Acknowledge Errors**: Justifying mistakes, avoiding responses, or denying debts; an inability to cede "power."  
2. **Lack of Empathy and Gratitude**: Inability to connect with others’ emotions or appreciate others’ kindness.  
3. **Moral Coercion**: Exploiting moral norms to manipulate others into serving their interests.  
4. **Envy**: Resentment toward others’ success.  
5. **Self-Interest Over Collective Benefit**: Rarely sacrificing for the collective—even when such sacrifice would yield disproportionate benefits—prioritizing short-term personal gain above all.  
6. **Mastery of Deception**: The most critical trait: these characteristics are not overt. They excel at wearing different masks for different audiences. In early cooperation, they hide NPD traits, even appearing more considerate than average and adept at providing emotional support. Only later, after their partners have invested significant sunk costs, do their NPD traits gradually surface.  

These self-deceptive individuals are not morally ignorant; they rarely act flagrantly against norms. Yet morality itself holds little intrinsic weight for them. Though deficient in moral intuition, they excel at weaponizing morality against others. Their primary concern is avoiding trouble or harm from violating norms—especially legal ones, which they scrupulously avoid. They are not unintelligent; many possess high intelligence, can engage in reasoned debate, and may even seem to listen, fostering unrealistic hope. In reality, this is often a stalling tactic.  

They excel at demanding service from others but offer no acknowledgment afterward, as if the assistance held no value. During conflicts, they may dismiss the help as "self-serving" or "unnecessary," preserving their "power." In matters of interest, their defining trait is *self-deception*: they use flawed reasoning to justify their actions, then deploy these "reasons" to persuade others. For example, their minor efforts are framed as "their time is life," while others’ significant contributions are trivialized with "everyone contributes equally." They selectively amplify favorable arguments and dismiss inconvenient ones, revealing glaring double standards, a habit of belittling others, and projecting their own malice onto others.  

They are capable of reflection, but any potential threat to their interests triggers hypervigilance, diverting all energy to avoiding harm—reason be damned. Fundamentally pragmatic, they relentlessly pursue gain. Given even a shred of justification, they disregard others’ suffering, clinging to their "righteousness." Their core is extreme self-centeredness; they instinctually devalue others’ pain and collective interests. They show little concern for partners’ circumstances, often making tone-deaf remarks like "why not eat meat?" All actions serve short-term self-interest, and they lack the foresightedness inherent to a healthy "selfish gene."  

Notably, such individuals are common among highly educated groups, reflecting a paradox: competent, virtuous individuals often struggle to thrive. Advancement through grabbingism becomes nearly inevitable, a product of Adversarial Evolution—an observation worthy of contemplation.  

*They represent an advanced degenerate stage of sophisticated egoists. This is a classic grabbing tactic evolved through Adversarial Evolution under the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism system and moral constraints. At its core, it maximizes exploitation of the cooperative instincts, empathy, reasonableness, and self-reflection of virtuous individuals, rendering it highly deceptive and addictive.*  


### **Tactic of Evil 2: Cultivating Mystery and Binding Interests**  
An online video titled *"Excessive Candor Is a Man’s Greatest Mistake"* advises men in relationships to withhold details of their romantic history, flaws, struggles, financial status, and negative emotions, and to avoid fully disclosing their true circumstances. The strategy centers on cultivating mystery—leaving others guessing, strategically hinting at positive traits through social media or casual conversation to shape favorable assumptions. This approach aims to avoid being "controlled" by women, inflate one’s image, and leverage mystery to stoke curiosity, keeping partners in a state of insecurity and manipulation.  

Undeniably, such pragmatic relationship tactics prove effective—not just in romances, but in ingratiating oneself to superiors, securing partnerships, and navigating business competitions. For instance, vying for a career opportunity: the optimal strategy is to feign mystery, make grand promises, and extract resources from superiors, who then advocate for you to higher authorities, binding their interests to yours. Even if your promises go unfulfilled, superiors, reluctant to admit poor judgment, will often shield you. Meanwhile, honest, competent competitors who reject empty promises are sidelined.  

This behavior is fundamentally deceptive, a form of *covert fraud* that evades moral condemnation and typifies Hypocrisyism. Superficially effective—securing partners beyond one’s "league," landing roles exceeding one’s capacity, or acquiring resources disproportionate to one’s contribution—such false posturing requires a web of lies to sustain, which inevitably unravels. The tactic’s sophistication lies in its aftermath: when the deception is exposed, victims are left with a bitter, unvented frustration—feeling cheated and "punched," yet unable to voice their grievances due to entangled interests (romantic, business, or project-based).  

*This dynamic often triggers the victim’s self-PUA and self-deceptive psychological defense mechanisms, where they rationalize the fraudster’s actions. The more mysterious the fraudster, the easier it is to concoct such justifications. These perverse defense mechanisms further embolden the fraudster, enabling even greater audacity.*

### With such rifts, how can spouses or business partners achieve unity of purpose and shared resolve, and how can they avoid resentment? The root cause of the rampant family breakdowns, partnership dissolutions, and project failures in today’s society lies in these shrewd, deceitful individuals. Unsurprisingly, such outcomes are even anticipated by these "shrewd" actors. Having already extracted excessive benefits from the previous cooperative relationship—whether through property division in divorce (or even genetic advantages) without parental responsibility, or securing large-project resumes and fixed income during the process—these resumes serve to manipulate the next group of victims. Only by breaking the previous relationship can they free themselves to target new ones, justifying their initial efforts to craft personas and lay groundwork. This pattern not only harms many but also corrupts the market, forcing sincere individuals to abandon integrity and adopt deceptive tactics. Women are advised to learn counter-tactics and avoid those who equivocate, evade direct answers, feign mystery, or meticulously construct personas. Caution against mystique; more often than not, it is a trap, not a treasure. Such individuals are often outwardly polished but inwardly flawed, prioritizing image over achievement, with true capabilities far inferior to their appearance. As repeatedly emphasized earlier, the degradation of post-evolutionary society stems not from diminished competence, but from the growing sophistication of hypocritical manipulations. This involutionary capability ultimately backfires, making societal survival precarious and defenses futile. Everyone toils exhaustively, yet no positive value is created.  

#### The Third Ruse of Evil—Hypocrisy’s Painted Skin: Do Not Let Superficial Impressions Cloud Judgement  
Human instincts for discerning virtue and evil (Virtue and Evil) engage multiple cues: behavior, demeanor, speech, etc. Yet the most primal, persistent, and stubborn judgment arises from appearance and aura. The adage "appearance reflects the mind" reflects this instinct—a non-logical yet potent human faculty, possibly rooted in genetic correlations between moral disposition and physical traits. Our instincts generally distinguish kindness from malice; kind individuals exude approachability, akin to immune cells identifying cancerous cells. Recognizing this, hypocritical genes (Hypocrisyism) have evolved to mimic "approachable" traits. Through reverse selection (Reverse Selection) over generations, they now nearly monopolize such genetic markers—echoing the fable "Ghost Painting Human Skin" from *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*. This story recounts a grotesque demon donning a painted human skin to masquerade as a beautiful woman, deceiving others to tear open their abdomens and devour their hearts. Exposed by a Taoist priest, the demon is forced to shed its disguise and is slain. The fable warns against succumbing to beauty, as it shelters hypocritical, grabbing (Grabbingism) genes. Human genetic instincts lag behind societal evolution, necessitating conscious correction.  

Beauty is not the only facade; eloquence, erudition, wealth, taste, academic credentials, authority, and "extensive connections" can all distort perception, leading to unwarranted idealization. Falling for such illusions invites manipulation. The term "disenchantment" has recently gained traction, urging critical rejection of blind admiration, particularly toward superficial, one-dimensional traits. These traits often confer evolutionary advantages in mating and resource acquisition, yet resemble elk’s large antlers—superficially advantageous for sexual selection (Sexual Selection) or human preference, but functionally useless. Consider beauty achieved through idleness, cosmetics, or excessive surgery: it sacrifices inner virtues. Academic credentials, too, may mask narrow-mindedness or self-centeredness in those who prioritize grades over character. Similarly, individuals who converse endlessly about trivia often lack profound knowledge; true erudition is deep, not superficial. Time and energy are finite; prioritizing superficial, label-driven, or utilitarian traits weakens foundational integrity. Such individuals often pursue these markers to exploit others, a hallmark of post-evolutionary traps. Disenchantment is a prerequisite for maturity—humans must strive to discern truth, avoiding instinctive and intuitive delusions.  

#### The Fourth Ruse of Evil—Resurrecting the Dead to Cross the River: Hypocrisy’s Moral Manipulation  
Hypocrites master moral coercion while evading it themselves. They act not for collective good, but to avoid reproach, evade accountability, and shield themselves from punishment. Their expertise lies in moral manipulation, with "killing with a borrowed knife" as a potent tactic. For example, if Proposal A harms their interests, they avoid defending their own gains. Instead, they identify a stakeholder B, exaggerate a minor issue, frame B as the aggrieved party, and passionately advocate for B—all to reject Proposal A. They then propose a "fair" alternative, which in reality harms A and B more severely but is polished as equitable, with the hypocrite as the true beneficiary. Such tactics are deployed seamlessly, as second nature.  

#### The Fifth Ruse of Evil—The Gambling Scheme  
We must not naively assume evil genes are foolish. Though many violent evils face legal and moral retribution, evil strategizes long-term, exploiting probabilistic models within rigorous virtue selection (Virtue Selection) mechanisms to execute the "gambling scheme." This requires no great skill: evil genes prompt carriers to act as sycophants or grand deceivers (Great Deceivers Appearing as Loyal Ones), ensuring minimal internal conflict—subordinating to the crueler. Leveraging the "limitation" of legal and moral penalties (maximizing at asset forfeiture or imprisonment), each carrier gambles, whether through literal gambling or life speculation (life speculation). If they fail, they feign victimhood to exploit; if successful, they propagate their genes via wealth. Current societal mechanisms make propagating genes through extreme evil easier than through extreme virtue. For evil genes, this gamble is nearly risk-free.  

### Two Orders of Society  
The concept of "two orders" has long circulated. I paraphrase a perspective from Zhihu:  

> Since ancient times, the dynamic of "others as knife and chopping block, we as fish and meat" persists, merely in new forms. Society’s resources are finite; wealth growth lags population growth. Every dollar you earn is a plunder of others’ wealth. For the elite, the greatest dividend is never oil, coal, or gold—it is the endless supply of ordinary people. Eighty percent of diligent individuals sustain 20% of non-laboring exploiters. These 80% exist to enhance the 20%’s lives, who in turn devise rules to control them. Driven by human selfishness, this social structure endures. Workers share a common experience: you do not wish to be prey, yet your body and labor sustain their flesh, your humility and flattery nourish their egos, and you prey on the weaker to sustain your own mental and emotional needs. If you are at the bottom, you target your defenseless children.  

> Order is "Confucius in public, Guiguzi in private": one order of fairness, morality, and decorum; another of hidden interest struggles. Interests drive human behavior; cost-benefit calculations never fail. Masters use the first order as a tool to achieve the second. Morality and decorum become veils for resource plunder. This arises from the interplay of overt virtue selection (Virtue Selection) and covert grabbing (Grabbingism) degradation.

The only thing we can do is exert every effort to halt Grabbing Degeneration. Yet if we give in, if we collude with it, if we accept the survival philosophy of wolves and tigers—then we will only deserve a pitiable world of enduring wind and sleeping under the stars, living from hand to mouth, restless in sleep, and constantly preparing to fight against surrounding enemies. This is the price we pay for failing to understand the nobility of humanity.  

### The Pinnacle of Hypocrisyism: The Art of Power with Cunning and Ruthlessness  
Human power was originally intended to enhance the efficiency of socialization—by entrusting authority to a minority to unify the pace and objectives of the masses, thereby achieving more efficient socialized production. However, in this process, power has proven to be the most profitable and the most susceptible to Grabbing Degeneration and Hypocrisyism. Thus, during periods of civilizational decline, the struggle over power has long lost its original purpose. Power has gradually evolved into a tool for manipulating others, grabbing benefits from them, and eliminating dissidents.  

Li Zongwu, in *The Philosophy of Cunning and Ruthlessness*, analyzed the leaders of the Three Kingdoms, noting that Cao Cao was ruthless in heart, Liu Bei brazen in face, and Sun Quan half-ruthless and half-brazen—qualities that enabled them to dominate their realms. Sima Yi, being both ruthless in heart and brazen in face, allowed the Sima clan to ultimately reap the fruits of victory. Nearly a century after the writing of this Eastern treatise on cunning and power, its Western counterpart—*The 48 Laws of Power*—was also compiled. This book masterfully summarizes the tactics of power-grabbing in a society where human nature has undergone Individual Cancerization. Below, we excerpt some of its laws for reflection.

- Never outshine your superior. Any subordinate who challenges their superior’s sense of self-centeredness or causes them to doubt the superiority of their position will not escape the fate of being eliminated. Even if you simply display your natural talents, you may inadvertently overshadow your superior. Some superiors harbor insecurities far more intense than the average person—sometimes to absurd extremes.  

- It is better to let others surpass you and claim the limelight than to become a casualty of their insecurities.  

- If you lack an enemy, create one. A clear, well-defined enemy serves as the strongest justification and proof of your existence and actions.  

- Conceal your intentions. Never reveal the true purpose behind your actions. Keep others uncertain, unable to prepare in advance. Mislead them down deep, winding paths; by the time they grasp your intent, it will be too late.  

- Use disguise to divert attention, leaving others unable to discern your true nature. Feign false honesty, emit ambiguous signals, and ensure your genuine objectives remain opaque.  

- If you crave power, cast aside sincerity at once. Train yourself in the art of masking your true intentions.  

- Human intuition instinctively trusts appearances. Declare your goals openly before others; if you publicize what you claim to desire, they will mistake your facade for reality.  

- Concealing your intentions does not require silence. On the contrary, chatter endlessly about false objectives. This achieves three aims: you appear friendly, open, and trusting; you subtly hide your true intent; and you leave your adversaries to exhaust themselves in futile speculation.  

- The most skilled deceivers display honesty in certain areas to mask dishonesty in others. Honesty becomes merely a prop in their game of deception.  

- A poker face—expressionless and unreadable—is often the perfect smokescreen. Cunning deceivers use the most unremarkable appearances to hide their true selves. They mask their nature behind familiar, mediocre, and harmless facades.  

- As you age and achieve success, it grows harder to disguise your cunning. In such cases, the best strategy is to openly embrace your nature—declare yourself a forthright scoundrel or a repentant rogue. Not only will others admire your candor, but oddly enough, you may continue to execute your schemes.  

- Defend your reputation with your life. Reputation is the cornerstone of power; it must be made unimpeachable. Stay vigilant against potential attacks, and learn to undermine your enemies’ reputations to destroy them.  

- Command attention at any cost. Surround your name with gossip and scandal. Create an unforgettable, controversial image, and use any means to draw others’ focus—even if it leaves you infamous. Any form of notoriety grants power. Court controversy, even scandal; invite criticism, even self-destruction. All are preferable to obscurity.  

- Cultivate an air of mystery. It is this quality of uncertainty and incomprehensibility that generates power. The mysterious hold others at a disadvantage—trapped in the desire to unravel their secrets. When mystery spirals beyond control, it breeds fear of the unknown.  

- If you find yourself trapped and passive in a situation, try a simple experiment: act in ways others cannot easily interpret. Let your actions allow for multiple explanations, leaving others to guess at your intent.  

- Have others labor for you and claim the credit as your own. The question of who receives credit for an invention or creation is critical—if not equal to the achievement itself, it is at least its peer. You must cling to credit tenaciously, guarding it against theft.  

- The world of power follows the law of the jungle, where some creatures survive by hunting and killing, and a throng (like hyenas and vultures) thrive on the spoils of others’ hunts. As you toil over a project, a flock of vultures circles above, plotting how to live off your creativity—and even rise higher on its wings.  

- If your power is not yet secure, seizing others’ credit is unwise. Thus, you must stand unshakably firm in your position before subtly exploiting others’ talents.  

- The essence of power lies in the ability to seize the initiative, to lead others by the nose, and to force adversaries and those around you onto the defensive.  

- Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once others suspect they are being controlled, they grow harder to manage. But if you let them believe they hold the reins—crafting the illusion that they command the situation—they will never feel led by you.  

- Swift attacks intimidate enemies, forcing them to react without time to think or plan.  

- Learn to maintain others’ dependence on you. You must make yourself perpetually needed and desired. Never teach others everything; once they master your skills, they will cast you aside. Like ivy clinging to a tree, entangle yourself so tightly with the source of power that removing you would leave a gaping wound.  

- Do not mistake your superiors’ reliance on you for affection. In truth, they resent and fear you. As Machiavelli noted, it is better to be feared than loved.  

- Deploy honesty and generosity selectively. A single act of genuine sincerity can overshadow a pattern of deceit. Once you breach your adversary’s fortified defenses with this strategic honesty, you may manipulate and deceive them at will.  

- Deception’s core is diversion. Acts of warmth, generosity, or honesty are often the most effective tools to distract. In ancient China, this tactic was called: “To take, one must first give.”  

- Honesty is the supreme strategy to disarm others, but not the only one. Generosity works equally well.  

- Some people reject self-interest, fearing others will perceive their actions as motivated by it. They crave opportunities to display their kindness. Do not hesitate to grant them this. Seeking their help is not subterfuge—it is them indulging their desire to be seen as benefactors.  

- Pose as a friend while acting as a spy. In the realm of power, your goal is to control future events. The challenge lies in the fact that people rarely reveal their full thoughts, emotions, or plans. They speak guardedly, hiding their most critical weaknesses, hidden motives, and obsessions. Infiltrate their defenses to uncover their secrets and intentions, without revealing your own. By feigning intimacy, you make others more likely to disclose their secrets. Offer false confessions, and they will repay you with truth.  

- Just as you spy on others, you must guard against being spied upon. Thus, the most potent weapon in the intelligence war is disinformation. As Churchill noted: “Truth is so precious that it should always be protected by a bodyguard of lies” (though Churchill’s original remark was contextual, made in reference to wartime).  

- A fearsome adversary must be utterly destroyed. Leave even a single spark unquenched, and the flames will reignite. Half-measures cost more than complete eradication. If you spare them out of compassion, they will one day strike back. This is the proper use of power: eliminate enemies without mercy, especially those who were once friends.  

- The pursuit of power breeds conflict and enemies. Some will oppose you regardless. If you cannot eliminate them, at least recognize their plots to undermine you. Remain indifferent to their false overtures of friendship. Proceed with caution, bide your time, and strike with precision when the moment is right.  

- Use absence to elevate respect and enhance your reputation. Learn when to withdraw temporarily; scarcity amplifies your value.  

- All power hinges on presence and absence. A commanding presence attracts power and attention, but overexposure backfires. The more frequently you are seen, the lower your perceived worth. This principle is clearest in love and seduction: infrequent absence creates an aura, but overfamiliarity dims it. Remember: do not start as a rarity—be omnipresent first. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed when gone.  

- Keep others on edge by cultivating an air of unpredictability. If they can anticipate your actions, they feel in control. Reverse this by acting in ways that baffle them, leaving them anxious and preoccupied with deciphering your motives. Unpredictability not only intimidates but also piques interest. People will discuss you, attributing irrelevant motives to your actions—and thus never forget you.  

- Understand the people you target. Never offend the wrong individuals. Those you dupe once will seek lifelong revenge; they are wolves in sheep’s clothing. Choose your adversaries or victims with extreme care. There are five most formidable types in the world of power:  
1. The arrogant: Even minor slights provoke vicious retaliation. Whatever you gain will never outweigh the cost.  
2. The deeply insecure: Linked to arrogance, they gnaw at you relentlessly, bite by bite.  
3. The paranoid: They see only the worst in others. Exploit their paranoia against others, but avoid becoming their target.  
4. The vengeful: They mask anger, biding their time. If you offend them, crush them utterly or banish them from your sight.  
5. The mediocre: Deceiving them is harder than expected. The dull do not take the bait; they lack awareness. Engaging them wastes time, energy, and resources.  

- In the kingdom of power, all is a matter of degree. Some have fragile egos that cannot tolerate even minor affronts. Test them first—jest harmlessly. Confident people laugh; the overly insecure feel insulted.  

- When weak, surrender rather than fight for hollow honor. Surrender buys time to recover, to torment and provoke your conqueror. It lulls enemies into complacency, granting you space to regroup, sabotage, and retaliate.  

- Master your emotions. Like an actor, you must laugh or weep on cue. Conceal anger and frustration; feign satisfaction and approval.  

- Align with the spirit of the age. If your ideas are too advanced, no one will understand you. In such circumstances, being overly forward-thinking is never wise.  

- Errors do not vanish with apologies. Better to redirect attention to a scapegoat before others fixate on your faults. Utilize pawns: let them execute unsavory tasks and shoulder the blame you would otherwise bear.  

- To acquire power with minimal effort, the most effective strategy is to become an icon. Five tactics to cultivate followers:  
1. Use vague, enigmatic language to promise grand goals.  
2. Appeal to their senses; deny them time to think.  
3. Organize crowds using religious structures.  
4. Conceal your financial sources.  
5. Foster an “us vs. them” rivalry.  

- Act boldly. Any mistake born of boldness can be rectified with even bolder action. If you are obscure, attack a giant. The larger your target, the greater the attention you command.  

- In achieving success, your actions must appear natural and effortless. Conceal your toil, effort, and cleverness. Avoid letting others see you labor. Accomplish feats with ease, and people will believe you could achieve more with greater effort—earning not just admiration, but awe.  

- People flee reality, for truth is uglier and more uncomfortable than their fantasies. Do not confront them with reality; you will bear the brunt of their rage when their dreams shatter. They rarely blame themselves; they seek external scapegoats. To wield power, become the source of their happiness—a happiness born of manipulating their illusions. Promise not hard work’s reward, but sudden, grand transformation and golden wealth. He who weaves beautiful tales amid oppressive reality holds supreme power.

Most people believe that the Doctrine of Thickness and Darkness (a philosophy advocating ruthless pragmatism) is something practiced but not spoken of. However, Li Zongwu and I both argue it is something spoken of but not practiced. The underlying principles here must not only be discussed but also frequently analyzed. Only through such discussions can we understand the true causes behind national and familial collapses, and recognize which seemingly shrewd actions, when viewed against the tide of history, amount to "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own foot." Take, for example, the Western Jin Dynasty, usurped by the Sima clan through manipulative and unscrupulous tactics. After successive generations of escalating power struggles among its descendants, the dynasty collapsed catastrophically by the second generation. The fall of Western Jin was brutal—northern Han communities were decimated, with nine out of ten households destroyed, and elites fled southward. This exemplifies the profound harm inflicted by the Doctrine of Thickness and Darkness. Moreover, there is no need to fear that publicizing this theory will lead to widespread imitation. Most people cannot truly master its essence; rote imitation only invites ridicule. Genuine practitioners of ruthlessness possess innate skills—they may not even consciously recall their actions, relying on selective memory and forgetfulness. They wield these tactics with instinctive proficiency, quickly rationalizing their misdeeds with lofty excuses. Such abilities are beyond the reach of ordinary people.  

### The Darkness of Human Nature  
We argue that the "Great Corruption Supported by Great Cooperation" applies not only to the Chinese nation but to human civilization as a whole. Students interested in this topic may explore *The Dark Triad Personality*—a combination of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. There is also the *Dark Empathetic Personality*, which emerges when Dark Triad traits are paired with false empathy, making it even more covert and seductive. These individuals often exhibit charm and social skills, building superficial rapport with others. They excel at masking their true intentions, projecting friendliness and approachability to gain trust, thereby facilitating manipulation. While they acutely perceive others' emotions and psychological states, they do not respond with genuine care or compassion. Instead, they exploit these perceptions to manipulate others' feelings—for example, deliberately inducing fear, anxiety, or guilt to achieve their goals, such as securing benefits or controlling behavior. They disregard traditional moral and ethical norms, showing no guilt or moral qualms when exploiting others' emotions. Driven by self-interest, they pursue their desires relentlessly, indifferent to others' suffering and even deriving a sense of achievement from it. Selfish, self-obsessed, and unscrupulous, they take pleasure in tormenting others and manipulate people according to their own needs. *Their empathy is a tool to exploit vulnerabilities; others’ pain leaves no genuine mark on their hearts, and the empathetic bonds they form are false.* A study by Heym and colleagues found that such personality types accounted for nearly 20% of their research group. Online, topics like "how to manipulate someone," "how to destroy someone psychologically," and "how to enslave someone" attract significant attention and enthusiasm. While their psychological motivations can be understood from an academic or adversarial evolutionary perspective, they are unimaginable from the standpoint of basic humanity.

*The most radiant, noble, and brilliant force in the universe is human nature, which makes human civilization shine amid the endless stars. Yet, it is precisely beneath the shelter of this great radiance that the darkest, most terrifying, hypocritical, obstinate, and incomprehensible aspects of human nature have festered.* The extremes of light and darkness in human nature, as manifested across the entire history of life and among all species, are unparalleled. In some cases, the contrast between an outwardly virtuous facade and inward malevolence is so stark as to be heart-wrenching. The adversarial evolutionary principle behind this unimaginable and unsettling truth—"Great Corruption Supported by Great Cooperation"—is, paradoxically, both obvious and inevitable.

Just as great individuals are supremely noble, the depravity of dark-hearted people knows no bounds. In the past, limited criminal investigation capabilities and information barriers left many cases shrouded in ambiguity. However, recent cases have laid bare the depths of human malice. For instance, in the Suzhou Spousal Murder case, a wife killed her husband, stored his body in a refrigerator for 15 months, and used his phone to defame him while骗取 (extorting) family property—all with such composure that her family remained unaware. In the Su Xiangmao case,翟欣欣 (Zhai Xinxin) defrauded her husband of money through a fake marriage, driving him to suicide with relentless greed. In the Thai Spousal Murder Insurance Fraud case, Yu Xiaodong—who had been affectionate and vowed eternal love before marriage—transformed into a lazy, gambling addict after marriage, ultimately pushing his pregnant wife off a cliff in Thailand to claim insurance. Such cases are increasingly common. The cunning, hypocrisy, and lack of conscience displayed by these "cancerous cells" are striking: they can express gratitude while continuing to harm you, or apologize while repeating the offense. Yet, these individuals are not the most insidious tumors. The truly dangerous ones operate invisibly, seizing benefits without a trace. Most people who have not experienced such betrayal firsthand cannot fathom the despair of being repeatedly deceived and harmed by those who feign kindness, as their actions continually redefine the limits of human depravity. *A genuinely kind person can never truly comprehend the hypocrisy and unfathomable darkness hidden beneath a human face.* For example, Sun Yat-sen found Yuan Shikai incomprehensible—Yuan’s flattery and deference seemed entirely sincere, leading Sun to trust him implicitly and urging Wang Xing to lower his guard. In reality, Yuan deceived both the Qing court, the revolutionaries, and the public. *For most Chinese people, the "hypocritical and grabbing genotypes" they encounter far exceed the capacity of their genetically pre-trained moral judgment models. Thus, the process of growing up often involves gradually recognizing the truth that "great villainy masquerades as loyalty, great deceit resembles sincerity, and great ugliness parades as beauty." The earlier one realizes this, the fewer losses one incurs.* Some never grasp this reality, remaining confused and regretful for life. However, this realization is often difficult—adversity reveals true character, and major trials are typically required to see someone’s true nature. *Their commitment to and pursuit of self-interest overrides all reason, yet this may be deeply hidden; they are indifferent to the suffering and sacrifices of anyone beyond themselves or their immediate genetic kin. The closer you peer into their twisted hearts, the colder your spine grows and the more you sweat. When you finally enter their inner depths, you discover an empty void. They are machines of hypocrisy, indistinguishable cancerous growths, opposing the most magnificent life phenomenon Earth has ever witnessed. This is the most insurmountable obstacle in the process of life’s dimensional ascension.* Against the harm inflicted by these malevolent forces, the survival of Chinese civilization to this day is a miracle. Forging new civilizational achievements is now an arduous task. Yet, I firmly believe that once these "tumors" are properly addressed, the Chinese nation will reignite the wheels of civilizational progress, contributing to the great cause of humanity.  

### "Astute" Pragmatists in the Era of Great Corruption  
Some individuals are indeed more adaptable to such an environment. They are socially adept, perceptive of human nature, and "speak the language of men to men, and the language of ghosts to ghosts." They possess skillful tactics to exploit the two types of "tumors" mentioned earlier, minimizing internal friction and turning it to their advantage. They avoid violating explicit moral and legal norms while fully utilizing all latent rules that allow them to evade moral and legal repercussions. Their actions are not driven by justice but by a desire to balance conflicting interests, regardless of virtue or vice. They can find equilibrium in complex environments and, to some extent, maximize collective interests under such conditions. Their philosophies of life are often admired by those who believe they have "seen through" societal truths, or they themselves take pride in their success, as if they have discovered a shortcut to achievement. However, this is merely a fleeting, illusory success. In essence, they are self-interested individuals. Pursuing localized, short-term success is a form of involution. Through this process, they may accumulate resources, talent, and reputation to facilitate their next transformation. Yet, it is precisely such compromises, cleverness, and small tactics that drive corporate culture, social culture, and market environments into involution—stifling innovation and reducing industries to mediocrity without substantive progress. Ultimately, these "astute" individuals are trapped in a cycle of involution, struggling to survive. *From the perspective of a high-dimensional life community, such temporary, trivial gains are shortsighted and counterproductive. The value they integrate through these means is fleeting, accompanied by constant "grabbing deficits." They fail to reverse the inversion of virtue and vice, prevent the decline of cooperation, or alter the broader environment. In essence, they enable the proliferation of "tumor genes," colluding with the "tumors" and accelerating their spread.*

### The Plight of the Virtuous During the Great Corruption Period  

For readers who have carefully perused the relevant chapters in the first volume, I am certain you still remember how the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist genotype rapidly rose to prominence, achieved success, and entered an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Before the emergence of the Hypocrisyist genotype, this was an extraordinarily idyllic Edenic Period for humanity. To this day, the memory and longing for that beautiful era remain etched deep within the human psyche—engraved in our genes as the most profound recollection of truth, virtue, and beauty. In fact, humanity could re-enter this world of truth, virtue, and beauty by fulfilling one condition alone: *Virtue is rewarded and evil is punished*.  

During the Great Corruption Period, the root cause of society’s steady decline and intractable decay lies precisely in the inversion of this principle—where virtue is punished and evil reaps benefits. As previously analyzed through the lens of Adversarial Evolution, the emergence of sophisticated self-interested individuals parasitizing the virtuous, and the tyrannical evil born from servile malice, these new forms of Grabbingism are like mountains pressing upon the virtuous, suffocating them and gradually subjecting them to Reverse Selection.  

Below, we briefly summarize the various forms of malice the virtuous must confront during the Great Corruption Period (one may draw parallels to the final years of the Western Jin, Southern Song, and Ming Dynasties).  

<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31342c5d-672a-4882-9b33-0902afbb7895" /></p>  
<p align="center">The Malice Faced by the Virtuous During the Great Corruption Period</p>  

In the Great Corruption Period, amidst the labyrinth of human fallacies, upholding virtue becomes an arduous task. The environment shaped by Adversarial Evolution coerces the good into vice, leaving no middle ground between servility and tyranny. A poignant adage rings true: "We will all eventually become the people we once despised." The oppressors, exploiters, and manipulators you encounter in this era are products of a system defined by excessive competition, hierarchical deception, and overfitted mechanisms—shaped by the environment’s selective pressures, almost as if "there is no other choice." Behind every irrational logic lies a deeper, more terrifying irrationality. This suffocating "no other choice" forces most virtuous individuals to either abandon their consciences or face Reverse Selection. The principle of "virtue rewarded, evil punished" is utterly subverted.  

At this juncture, Sexual Selection itself undergoes a gradual reversal. Where human women once admired men of justice, kindness, courage, moral fortitude, and social responsibility, they now gravitate toward those in positions of power, status, and political acumen—individuals adept at manipulation and self-interest. They even harbor a peculiar fascination for the audacious, rule-defiant, base, fraudulent, and belligerent. Consider Lao Rongzhi, a woman of decent standing, who developed admiration for Fa Ziying, a convicted criminal and married man. Despite the risks of manipulation, domestic abuse, and abandonment, they hurl themselves into such relationships like moths to a flame. Even when subjected to servility, torment, and degradation, they endure passively, lacking the will to resist. This is their choice—a choice they would likely repeat.  

For the allure of villains lies not in this life, but in posterity. Within a corrupt environment, such individuals can Reverse Select the virtuous. The descendants of women who admire the virtuous, lacking the requisite ruthlessness, cunning, and cruelty, fail to endure across generations. Over time, Sexual Selection itself is inverted, leading to a chain of tragic, lamentable, and dire consequences.  

The virtuous, in their cooperative and intimate relationships, often attract individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), particularly Covert Narcissists. NPD types target those who are willing to give selflessly and avoid petty计较—a perfect "blood bank" for their exploitation. Once their interests are bound, these Covert Narcissists leverage *sunk costs* to blackmail the virtuous over the long term. The virtuous are ultimately left deeply wounded, discarded once they lose utility.  

The virtuous struggle to comprehend evil, for their life’s driving forces diverge fundamentally. The virtuous derive their motivation from love, the joy of creation, and the fulfillment of cooperative dividends born from mutual aid. In contrast, evil’s impetus may stem from envy, the thrill of acquiring what is not one’s own, the pleasure of appropriating others’ wealth through idleness, the satisfaction of vanquishing imagined foes, or the pain of being enslaved. For the wicked, reducing their envy or alleviating their servitude might strip their lives of purpose.  

When viewed through the framework of Adversarial Evolution, these bizarre and unfathomable phenomena become both inevitable and logical. Though subtle, the forces of Adversarial Evolution erode like water wearing away stone—an inescapable outcome of evolution.  

At this point, the true virtue that endures must transcend trivialities, sacrificing minor moralities to uphold greater principles; otherwise, it cannot persist. Yet it is precisely this that causes genuine virtue and hypocrisy to appear indistinguishable. Hence, this era witnesses the paradox of "great hypocrisy resembling truth" and "great loyalty appearing as treachery"—a state of moral ambiguity that further deepens the Great Corruption’s eerie and tragic character.  

Instances such as Ji Kang’s execution and the extinction of *Guangling San*, Ruan Ji’s lamenting chants, Zhang Juzheng’s political persecution after his "bereavement leave," and Yuan Chonghuan’s execution by dismemberment all fall into this category. In political strife, figures like Wang Yan—self-interested, idle in debate, sycophantic, and evasive—often outlive others.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9797340-1521-4c7c-831e-14c6dd9e3655" /></p>  

Amidst the suffocating stench of decay pervading this dark era, faint glimmers of light persist—nurtured by the roots of Confucian culture. These will coalesce when the time arrives, striving to pierce and illuminate the corrupt body. As Romain Rolland once wrote, "There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it still."  

The greatness of the Chinese nation lies in its abundance of such heroes—individuals with piercing vision, strategic acumen, foresight, unwavering loyalty, resilience in adversity, unyielding integrity, lofty aspirations, and unshakable moral courage. Amidst a body riddled with cancerous cells and tumors, they rekindle the miracle of life, responsibility, and mission.  

In truth, these qualities are the essence of the Chinese nation’s millennia-old heritage; these individuals are the true spirit of China. Compared to younger nations, states, and civilizations, the Chinese civilization’s ability to endure and rejuvenate despite being riddled with "tumors" is a near-unique miracle in the annals of human history.
