# The Decline of Empires—The Spread of Cancer Cells  
Compared to the excellent virtues at the beginning of an empire's establishment, how does the process of imperial decline emerge?  

## Autocratization and Imperial Power Expansion  
Compared to the excellent virtues at the beginning of the rise of barbarian tribes, after unifying the Central Plains, all barbarian regimes gradually deviated from the principles they initially upheld. The process of "sinicization" to some extent reflects this trend.  

### Rapid Sinicization and Autocratization of Barbarian Regimes After Gaining Power  
For example, the Qidan (Khitan) originally consisted of eight tribes, each electing a chieftain, with a leader jointly elected by all tribes, who would step down after three years. As stated in Volume 266 of the Zizhi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government): "In our Qidan tribe, the traditional rule is that the chief steps down after three years." (The New History of the Five Dynasties, Appendix on the Four Barbarians, Volume 1, records: "The leaders of the tribes are called 'great men,' and a 'great man' is usually elected to hold the banner and drum, governing the eight tribes. If, over time, the state suffers disasters or livestock decline, the eight tribes gather to discuss and replace him with the next in line. The replaced chief accepts this as per the original agreement and does not contest it.") However, Yelü Abaoji (872–926), the founding emperor of the Qidan, heavily relied on Han Chinese officials. Following "Han systems," officials such as Han Zhigu instructed Yelü Abaoji to abolish the rotational leadership system and fix the throne within his own family. (The New History of the Five Dynasties, Appendix on the Four Barbarians, Volume 1, states: "Han Chinese advisors told Abaoji, 'In the Central Plains, kings do not rotate.' Thus, Abaoji increasingly used his authority to control the tribes and refused to step down." The Luting Zaji (Records of the Barbarian Court) of the Song Dynasty mentions: "Han Zhigu, Han Ying, Kang Mei, Wang Zoushi, and Wang Yu—all Han Chinese—urged Emperor Taizu not to step down." Similar accounts appear in Volume 23, "Merging Tribes," of the Records of the Khitan State.) Eventually, he emulated the Central Plains imperial system and declared himself emperor.  

A key step in the sinicization of the Jin Dynasty was the abolition of the old Bolelie system (a council of noble ministers) during the reigns of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Xizong of Jin. The Bolelie system was a合议ist system where major state policies were decided through collective deliberation among "Bolelie" (noble ministers), ensuring relative equality. However, under the sinicization measures of Emperors Taizong and Xizong, the Bolelie system was replaced by Han-style official systems, with the explicit aim of centralizing power in the hands of the Jin emperors.  

Before entering the Central Plains, the Qing maintained tribal traditions, with neither Nurhaci nor Hong Taiji holding absolute power as sole rulers. The influential Council of Princes and Ministers allowed Manchu nobles to influence state affairs through deliberation. However, as autocratization deepened, this system was abolished during the Yongzheng era and replaced by bureaucratic institutions like the Grand Council. Manchu nobles, once key participants in political and military affairs, were reduced to idle stipend recipients.  

Of course, centralization was initially not driven by personal greed but by the practical needs of governing a vast empire, enabling efficient command and policy implementation. However, centralization often laid the groundwork for the corruption and decline of the ruling class. Two typical phenomena emerge in East Asian history: First, the military strength and competitiveness of Chinese empires weakened as autocratization deepened; second, when barbarian tribes entered the Central Plains, they retained strong tribal traditions, making them militarily formidable and often victorious against larger forces. Yet, upon adopting the tools of the former central empires, they destroyed their own tribal traditions and gradually decayed. This second process is often glorified by later scholars as the "sinicization" of nomadic peoples, but it requires nuanced evaluation. On one hand, nomads learning from the Han in areas such as writing, technology, and culture was certainly positive; on the other hand, adopting the manipulative political tactics of Han emperors—such as the story of Su Chuo advising Yuwen Tai—was far from praiseworthy. Such "experience" is essentially a Pandora's box: while it provides short-term advantages, overuse inevitably leads to dynastic decline.  

### Peasant Uprising Dynasties Also Underwent Autocratization  
In essence, "sinicization" is a process of consolidating and expanding imperial power. Barbarian regimes pursued sinicization to strengthen imperial authority, while peasant uprising leaders who ascended to the throne were even more brutal, directly eliminating meritorious officials to consolidate power.  

Earlier, we discussed how Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu of Han) gathered followers through bribes and promises of high positions and wealth, who then helped him conquer the empire. However, after securing power, he not only reneged on his promises but also massacred these meritorious officials, directly killing or driving to suicide figures like Han Xin, Peng Yue, Ying Bu, and Han Wangxin. Yet compared to Zhu Yuanzhang (Emperor Taizu of Ming), Liu Bang was merciful. Zhu Yuanzhang emulated Liu Bang in purging meritorious officials, but with greater severity. The Grand Councilor Hu Weiyong was executed on charges of "usurping power" and "conspiring rebellion" in 1380; Lan Yu, a brilliant general who defeated the Northern Yuan in the desert, was also killed in 1393. Hu Weiyong's execution also implicated key officials such as Chen Ning (Censor-in-Chief) and Tu Jie (Vice Censor-in-Chief). Ten years after Hu Weiyong's death (1390), Zhu Yuanzhang revisited the case, implicating Li Shanzhang (a founding minister). At age 77, Li Shanzhang, along with his wife, daughters, siblings, and nephews—over 70 people—were executed for failing to report Hu Weiyong's alleged rebellion. Simultaneously executed were nobles such as Lu Zhongheng (Marquis of Ji'an), Tang Shengzong (Marquis of Yan'an), Fei Ju (Marquis of Pingliang), Zhao Yong (Marquis of Nanxiong), Zheng Yuchun (Marquis of Xingyang), Huang Bin (Marquis of Yichun), and Lu Ju (Marquis of Henan), with over 30,000 people implicated. In the Lan Yu case, over 15,000 were executed. All these cases were justified with vague, contradictory "evidence" under charges like "conspiring rebellion" or "collaborating with enemies," making them essentially unjust.  

The Qing historian Zhao Yi noted: "While Emperor Gaozu of Han was cruel in purging meritorious officials, he only eliminated those like Han Xin and Peng Yue... It was Zhu Yuanzhang, relying on his meritorious officials to conquer the empire, who then arrested and killed them all after securing power. His cruelty is 'unprecedented in history.'"  

Centralizing power under certain enlightened emperors could enhance administrative efficiency and facilitate policy implementation. However, individual decision-makers are more prone to corruption, and "Virtue Selection" and oversight mechanisms are more likely to lapse. A centralized ruler, isolated and easily flattered or deceived by sycophants, makes the dynasty highly dependent on the emperor's quality. When the emperor is incompetent, decline follows swiftly.  

We know that without competitive selection mechanisms, a group's grabbing-based corruption is nearly inevitable. This process accelerates within the imperial clan, which, as the ruling class of the community, is analogous to a brain tumor in a human body—capable of killing the organism even if other organs remain healthy. Thus, the grabbing-based corruption of the ruling class is the most common cause of imperial decline.  

## The Proliferation of Imperial Clansmen  
In most Chinese dynasties, princes and imperial relatives received generous treatment, leading to the rapid expansion of the imperial clan population within decades or centuries of a dynasty's founding (setting aside large-scale fratricidal conflicts). Take the Ming Dynasty as an example. According to Ming regulations: "All imperial clansmen are recorded in the Jade Register, with their living expenses fully borne by the state. Upon birth, a clansman is registered with the court; at a young age (initially 10, later 15), they are granted a title; subsequently, they receive allowances for housing, attire, and marriage, and posthumous burial expenses. All titled clansmen receive stipends based on their rank. Even if stripped of titles for serious crimes, they still receive a subsistence allowance."  

Imperial titles were divided into eight ranks, each with high status and stipends. A Prince (first rank) received an annual stipend of 10,000 dan of grain; a County Prince (second rank) received 2,000 dan; the lowest-ranking Lieutenant Protecting the State (eighth rank) received 200 dan. By comparison, the Ming scholar He Liangjun estimated that a farming couple in the fertile Songjiang region earned between 7 and 70–80 dan of grain annually, depending on land quality.  

Under these incentives, each new imperial child represented unearned income. Zhang Xuan's Xiyuan Wenjianlu (Records of Western Garden Observations) humorously noted: "The birth of one General Protecting the State secures 1,000 dan of stipend annually; ten such generals secure 10,000 dan!" Consequently, imperial clansmen married prolifically, driving rapid population growth. Xu Guangqi, a Ming scholar, estimated the imperial population doubled every 30 years; Wang Shizhen estimated a doubling every 10–15 years. Compared to the Ming population, which hovered around 50–60 million (as recorded in the Ming Shilu), the growth of the imperial clan was strikingly rapid.  

By the 32nd year of the Jiajing reign (1553), stipends for the imperial clan accounted for 37.3% of the Ming Dynasty's total land tax revenue. In provinces like Shanxi, stipend expenses alone strained local finances to the point of insolvency.  

In the late Ming, the Governor of Shanxi reported an anecdote: The Prince of Qingcheng in Shanxi set a new record for imperial procreation, fathering over 140 sons. During family gatherings, each member had to introduce themselves to avoid mutual unfamiliarity. The Prince of Qingcheng was not alone; Ming princes were notoriously prolific, with dozens or even hundreds of children considered normal. This was driven by institutional incentives: each additional child entitled the imperial family to an additional stipend based on rank.  

By the late Ming, many provinces could no longer afford to support their local princes. The Prince of Fu in Henan, later killed and cooked in a "Lucky Banquet," met such a tragic end because his extravagance burdened the people, fueling deep resentment.

If all members of the imperial family were Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists—capable of mutual cooperation with the people, upholding justice, and punishing vice—then such individuals would be all the more welcome. However, reality runs counter to this ideal. The imperial family, being a highly lucrative institution, attracts a throng of Grabbingist genetic individuals. These individuals lack other capabilities but excel in flattery, sycophancy, and internal strife. Given any opportunity, they exploit the imperial power and wealth to propagate their genes. These latent Grabbingists, akin to social parasites, reduce the Cooperative Dividend of the entire human community as their proportion grows. The Grabbing Deficit deepens, and since they often hold power and make societal decisions, the decline of the human community becomes all but inevitable.  

### Reverse Selection: The Slow Propagation of Great Men’s Lineages and the Rapid Reproduction of Petty Individuals  
Let us also examine the offspring of national pillars—individuals who embody the spirit of the nation. Take examples from the Song and Ming dynasties: Yu Qian imprisoned, Yue Fei wronged, Zhang Juzheng (Taishan)’s home ransacked, and Yuan Chonghuan executed by dismemberment. All these great men were national heroes, devoting themselves "to the exhaustion of their strength until death," yet they endured great injustice—a fitting reflection of Chairman Mao’s verse: "The right path in the world is fraught with vicissitudes."  

Yu Qian, who at 17 wrote the poem "Unfearing bone and body shattered, to leave purity in the world," was wrongfully executed, leaving only one son and one daughter. His son, Yu Mian, held a low-ranking position during Yu Qian’s tenure to avoid suspicion, and later suffered further persecution due to his father’s冤案. Yu Qian, upholding lofty virtue and modeling himself after Wen Tianxiang, left a precious lineage—yet its survival remains uncertain.  

Yue Fei had five sons: Yun, Lei, Lin, Zhen, and Ting. His eldest son, Yue Yun, was executed alongside him, but the lineage of his third son, Yue Lin, flourished, producing the "Seven Yue Clans" of Huantai, whose descendants retained their ancestors’ fortitude and commitment to justice.  

Yuan Chonghuan, another tragic figure, dedicated himself to the nation but was falsely accused of treason, executed by dismemberment, and his head paraded across frontiers. He left no recorded offspring, though folklore claims friends hid his son to protect him—a narrative Jin Yong wove into his martial arts novel *The Sword Stained with Royal Blood*, where he fictionalized a son, Yuan Chengzhi, presumably to alleviate popular grief over Yuan Chonghuan’s injustice.  

Next, consider Zhang Juzheng, the Grand Secretary of the Wanli era, whom Liang Qichao hailed as "the prime minister of all ages." A master of officialdom’s unspoken rules, he used them not for personal gain but to salvage the Ming Dynasty. After his death, he was posthumously attacked by the young Wanli Emperor, who, incited by schemers, coveted his wealth—only to be disappointed by the meager findings. Zhang’s eldest son, Zhang Jingxiu, hanged himself under humiliation; his second son, Zhang Maoxiu, a former top scholar, attempted suicide by drowning, then starved himself, surviving only to spend his later years compiling *Collected Works of Zhang Taishan* before dying in exile. Of Zhang’s three sons, two perished prematurely. Even Hai Rui, a man notoriously unskilled in self-preservation, praised Zhang: "Taishan excelled in serving the state but faltered in safeguarding himself," a testament to Zhang’s dedication. Despite the persecution of his lineage, Zhang’s great-grandson, Zhang Tongchang, later exemplified the family’s loyalty by defending a doomed Southern Ming city to the end. In 1963, Guo Moruo inscribed at Zhang’s descendant’s tomb: "A true extraordinary man, Zhang the loyal and valiant of Jiangling."  

These precious lineages—national pillars and heroes—endure persecution yet retain their integrity. More lamentable is the genetic advantage enjoyed by Group-Detrimental Selfish individuals, who often have multiple spouses and excel at procreation. Their bloodlines and descendants pose incalculable harm to the nation.  

To be clear, we do not advocate genetic determinism. Take Qin Dashi, a top scholar during the Qianlong era (possibly a descendant of Qin Zi, elder brother of the infamous Qin Hui and a pro-war faction leader). Qin voluntarily paid homage to Yue Fei at West Lake, knelt before Qin Hui’s statue bound in disgrace, and penned the widely quoted line: "Since the Song, men have blushed to bear the name Hui; I kneel here, ashamed of my surname Qin." Qin Dashi served as an upright official, benefiting the people, and his legacy endures. Today, visitors still frequent his former residence on Changle Road, Nanjing.  

Objectively, however, Group-Detrimental Selfish genes do enjoy far greater reproductive advantages than mutually beneficial genes. This shifting balance between the two genetic groups, accelerated by Sexual Selection, creates an irreversible evolutionary trend. Evolving new, breakthrough capabilities requires rare mutations and millennia of time, but altering the proportional distribution of genetic traits can occur within a few generations.  

### Parasitic Lifeforms Outliving Their Hosts  
We should not merely resent these extreme Group-Detrimental Selfish genes but study them scientifically. Objectively, their genetic programming drives choices that serve their short-term—and even long-term—interests. Devoid of national integrity, they behave like leeches: after draining one group, they flatter and attach themselves to another, rotting it from within until collapse, then migrating to a new host. History abounds with such examples.  

Take the case of Du Xun, a eunuch, and Wang Chengyun, a general, who in 1644 (the 17th year of Chongzhen) surrendered Xuanfu to Li Zicheng, greeting the rebel army thirty li outside the city. Zhu Zhifeng, the governor, rebuked them: "You were trusted by the Emperor, entrusted with the frontier. Now you collude with rebels—how dare you face the Emperor?" Du Xun laughed and left without a word. Zhu, seeing no hope, hanged himself. Here we see two fates: Group-Detrimental Selfish individuals, who betray the state without hesitation, propagate their genes; loyalists like Zhu Zhifeng perish. What chills most is Du Xun’s laughter—he deemed his treachery trivial. These individuals, likely "excellent" Hypocrisyist performers, rise through flattery and exclusion of dissent. Despite their unmeritorious service, they betray without remorse, yet their bloodlines persist.  

## Inhibiting Brain Cancerization Fails to Prevent Systemic Cancerization  
The corruption of rulers—Brain Cancerization—is the primary cause of the collapse of most dynasties lasting 100–300 years. What if we could inhibit this Brain Cancerization? Direct Democracy emerged to address this issue. By mitigating Brain Cancerization, it enabled ancient Greek civilizations, particularly Athens, to reach artistic and scientific heights. Yet its flaws soon surfaced: impulsiveness, superficiality, and susceptibility to manipulation, as seen in the execution of Socrates and the Peloponnesian War.  

Witnessing Greece’s decline, the Romans chose a different path to avoid Brain Cancerization: the Senate System. Few nations have escaped Brain Cancerization, but Rome nearly succeeded, far outlasting typical dynasties. Its political innovations—Senatorial Republic, checks between Consuls and Tribunes, term limits for Dictators—were designed to prevent Brain Cancerization. Though society was stratified, Romans did not act solely for their class, ethnicity, or nation. The Scipio family exemplifies this: Scipio repeatedly advocated for other peoples and states; his descendants, the Gracchi brothers, risked their lives for plebeians; Caesar fought for commoners and non-Romans; Brutus assassinated his benefactor Caesar to defend the Republic. All embodied the thinking of Four-Dimensional lifeforms.  

After the Punic Wars, Roman plebeians bled and died for victory, only to return home to find their lands seized by nobles. This injustice spurred the Gracchi reforms. In their speeches, the Gracchi appealed:  
> "Every beast that roams Italy  
> Has its own lair to rest  
> Yet those who fought for Italy  
> Have no right to anything  
> Save air and sunlight  
> They have no fixed abode  
> Wandering with wives and children  
> Nominally masters of the world  
> Yet landless, destitute"

Precisely because Rome had a group of heroes with profound Four-Dimensional Life Consciousness, the decline of Rome was nearly slower than that of any other massive human community in the world. Unlike most Eastern empires, which often collapsed or underwent dynastic changes rapidly after the corruption of their ruling elites, the corruption of Rome's ruling class proceeded at a more gradual pace. Although Rome had emperors, their situation differed vastly from Eastern imperial rulers with their numerous consorts, lives of effortless indulgence, and imperial edicts that no one dared to defy. In Rome, both institutional and traditional constraints significantly curbed imperial power; even the emperors' personal safety was far from guaranteed. Take the 3rd century CE as an example: of the 22 emperors, 14 were murdered, and several died in battle, leading many to shun the throne. Roman emperors labored tirelessly; many had no biological heirs, and succession typically passed to carefully selected adoptive successors. Among them were historian-emperor Claudius and philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius. In the early years of the Roman Empire, when it was still relatively young, even after enduring the tyrannies of the infamous Caligula and Nero, Rome experienced only brief turmoil before stabilizing. Later, the Five Good Emperors initiated a century of virtuous rule—much like a middle-aged person recovering from a sudden illness, their vitality restored because their body still retained a high proportion of highly cooperative "cells," with minimal cancerization and external forces insufficient to destabilize them. Even if the "brain" (central authority) became cancerous, the body's healthy cells could still differentiate to form a new, functional "brain." The fall of Rome cannot be attributed primarily to the corruption of the imperial family; rather, it stemmed more from the corruption of the Senate, Roman nobility, and even the common people. Unlike most Eastern dynasties, whose collapses were often due to "brain tumors" (centralized power corruption), Rome's institutional safeguards against imperial corruption were far more effective, greatly reducing the risk of such "brain tumors." This is why Rome outlasted most dynasties. It evaded brain tumors and mob rule, yet ultimately could not escape the spread of cancer cells—for the longer a system survives, the higher the probability of tumor development and the broader its spread. Rome perished from systemic cancer.  

This stands in stark contrast to the early Roman people, who were simple, resolute, brave, responsible, trustworthy, mission-driven, and steeped in collectivist spirit and heroism. By the mid-empire, the Senate had become corrupt. During the Jugurthine War (118 BCE), Jugurtha repeatedly bribed the Senate to exonerate himself, leaving behind the infamous remark upon departing Rome: "A city for sale, and doomed to speedy ruin, if it finds a purchaser." Later, the Roman people as a whole succumbed to greed, hedonism, decadence, and a culture of excess. The empire's bathhouses and banquet culture exemplified this transformation. Bathhouses devolved into seedy pleasure dens, while feasts became orgies of indulgence. Slaves attended to their reclining masters, who, in their gluttony, used goose quills to induce vomiting after overeating—wasting resources purely to sustain the thrill of consumption. This was no longer the enterprising, humble, innovative people of centuries past. Cancer cells had gradually replaced the benign ones. By the empire's twilight, few Romans were willing to fight for their nation. They numbly allowed foreign tribes to trample "the City of God." Stilicho, known as the "Last Roman," was nearly the sole figure in Rome's final days who fought valiantly for the republic, achieving remarkable military successes akin to Yue Fei resisting the Jurchens or Yuan Chonghuan defending against the Qing. Ironically, he was half-Vandal—a "barbarian" in Roman eyes. This barbarian-born Roman embodied the spirit of Rome's founders. Yet even he met a wrongful death in internal political strife. [This scene mirrors the decline of Eastern dynasties, where petty officials rise to power and loyal heroes are persecuted—Stilicho's fate echoing those of Yue Fei and Yuan Chonghuan.]  

[Group corruption and systemic cancer metastasis are the most fearsome existential threats to life forms across dimensions, whether 3D, 4D, or 5D. At this stage, even the most advanced life forms are powerless to reverse course. Few nations or peoples, however, survive long enough to reach this stage of widespread group corruption; most perish earlier, felled by "brain tumors."]  

### Moral Decay: A Hallmark of Imperial Senescence and Cancerization  

Historical accounts of the fall of both the Qin-Han Empire (referring to the Han Chinese empires from the Qin to Wei-Jin periods) and the Roman Empire converge in emphasizing the moral collapse of these empires in their later stages. Edward Gibbon’s *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*, one of the most influential works on the subject, directly identifies declining moral standards—including "base sentiments, erosion of martial virtue, and dissipation of talent"—as the "primary factor in Rome’s decline." He writes: "The descendants of those once valiant commanders now obsessed over status and rank, channeling their ambition into court intrigue and imperial pageantry. Provinces, alienated by political disempowerment or lack of unity, sank into a lethargic atmosphere of self-interest."  

In the case of the Western Jin’s collapse, the breakdown of Confucian patriarchal morality directly weakened clan cohesion and eroded the Sima family’s power. In Rome, the dissipation of free and republican spirit stripped the Romans of their courage to defy tyranny, rendering them "spiritual dwarves" compared to the "fierce northern giants"—the Germanic and Xiongnu tribes, whom Rome and Han China deemed "barbarians." Did these "barbarians" possess higher moral standards? Historical longevity and economic prosperity do not necessarily equate to moral superiority. Younger civilizations, particularly those newly victorious in group selection, having avoided severe Reverse Selection, often retained more of their primitive tribal morality. Even long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy remained a byword for vice, scorned by northern European peoples. In the 15th and 16th centuries, an English proverb warned: "The Italianate Englishman is the devil incarnate"—a telling indictment.  

The later Romans were no longer the enterprising, justice-seeking, resilient, united, humble, and inclusive people who had built great achievements. [The true Romans did not perish; they were quietly replaced by a "Roman cancer" of a new, degenerate people. Early and late Romans might as well be considered two distinct peoples. Understanding this makes the rise and fall of civilizations in human history far less perplexing.]  

[Prolonged absence of group competition, internal autocratic corruption, and chronic Reverse Selection typically leave only two types of survivors: First, decadent bureaucrats or nobles adept at seizing power and resources, skilled in infighting and PUA-like manipulation of the "loyal," yet incapable of fulfilling obligations. Second, servile "docile subjects" who kowtow to authority, bully the weak, and fear the strong. The first type parasitizes the fruits of past achievements, leeching vitality while suppressing and slandering innovators and capable individuals. The second type is the product of the first’s selection—gullible, easily manipulated, indifferent to principle, and deferential to power. These two types embody the quintessential "cancer cells" of late Eastern dynasties.]  

### Machinations, Factionalism, and Infighting: Markers of Dynastic Cancerization and Collapse  

[Infighting and internal strife among factions, parties, or key figures—disregarding the collective good—are critical indicators of a severe decline in Group Cooperation Degree and the onset of cancerous corruption.]  

In a group with high Cooperation Degree, moral instincts for collaboration remain strong. Even among those with differing political views, debates yield to collective interests, and partisan loyalties are set aside for impartial decision-making—like Fabius and Scipio during the Second Punic War. In groups with drastically reduced Cooperation Degree, [internal conflicts and animosity surpass those with external enemies; familial strife and partisan battles become matters of life and death, while external subjugation is deemed a lesser evil. For an empire in its twilight, this is nearly an inevitable outcome of Adversarial Evolution—one that will recur unless humanity achieves monumental breakthroughs in institutional design and instinctual cultivation.]  

Such dynamics were pronounced in the final stages of the Western Jin and Southern Ming. [Both periods mark the late "cancer stages" of Han Chinese regimes: the Western Jin as the watershed of Han decline after the Qin-Han-Jin era, followed by a "reset" through integration with external ethnic groups; the Ming and Southern Ming as the end of Han resurgence after two to three centuries of cancerization, defeated and "reset" by the newly ascendant Manchu.]  

[The cancerization of all empires begins at their birth, often starting with the ruling class—for they are typically adept at leading groups to victory in internal struggles.]  

Cancer cells are always [skilled in infighting but inept externally]. When a group triumphs in inter-group competition and attains great dominance, individual corruption and cancerization begin. This process generally reaches terminal stages within two to three centuries.  

### The Fall of the Western Jin: Undone by Machinations and Infighting

As a paradigmatic case of ethnic decline, the Western Jin Dynasty, following the great ethnic reshuffling and integration of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, re-entered a cycle of corruption and cancerization, ultimately approaching collective "death." Its representative behaviors were intrigue, power-grabbing, hypocrisy, and prioritization of internal strife. Among these, the Rebellion of the Eight Princes, which typified the cancerous ethos of a declining people, stands as the most iconic event.  

The Rebellion of the Eight Princes began with Jia Nanfeng's misrule. To prevent the Crown Prince from ascending the throne smoothly and to maintain her control over the elderly Emperor Sima Zhong, she first incited Princes Sima Liang and Sima Wei to eliminate Empress Dowager Yang, who was protecting the Crown Prince, under the pretext of eradicating consort kin influence. Power then fell to the senior Prince Sima Liang. Jia Nanfeng later manipulated Sima Wei, fabricating an imperial edict ordering him to eliminate the "usurping" Sima Liang. Having long held a grudge against Sima Liang, Sima Wei seized the opportunity to kill him. Jia Nanfeng then reversed course, accusing Sima Wei of forging the edict and擅杀 (illegally executing) ministers, leading to Sima Wei's execution. Thus, two of the eight princes were eliminated.  

To further consolidate control, Jia Nanfeng adopted a child from her brother-in-law's family, claiming it as her own son with the Emperor, and imprisoned the Crown Prince to install her adopted child as heir. At this juncture, Prince Sima Lun, another ambitious prince, entered the fray. Though opposed to power falling into Jia Nanfeng's consort kin, he also resisted restoring the Crown Prince, deeming the young, vigorous prince harder to control than the elderly Emperor. His strategist proposed a "two-birds-with-one-stone" scheme: Sima Lun first spread rumors that the Crown Prince's faction planned a coup to rescue the prince and oust Jia Nanfeng. Panicked, Jia Nanfeng executed the Crown Prince, after which Sima Lun emerged to kill Jia Nanfeng and seize power.  

Sima Lun's ambition then led him to usurp the throne, imprisoning Emperor Sima Zhong. To secure loyalty, he bestowed titles lavishly—ennobling thousands—exhausting the supply of sable fur for court caps, forcing the use of dog fur instead. Hence the idiom "a dog's tail appended to a sable's" (used to describe shoddy additions to something fine).  

Sima Lun's faction, morally bankrupt and inept at governance, faced opposition from three other princes—Sima Jiong, Sima Yong, and Sima Ying—who launched a civil war that claimed nearly 100,000 lives. Sima Lun was eventually forced to commit suicide, becoming the third prince to perish. After quelling the rebellion, Sima Ying feigned humility and returned to his fief, leaving Sima Jiong to dominate the court.  

Power struggles over the heir apparent soon reignited. Sima Yi, the only prince with integrity and capability among the eight, clashed with Sima Jiong in Luoyang, defeating and killing him, along with the execution of 2,000 of his followers and their three generations of kin. With Sima Yi in power, Sima Yong, resentful of his monopoly, repeatedly attempted to assassinate him without success. In 303 CE, Sima Yong dispatched General Zhang Fang with 70,000 troops, joining Sima Ying's 200,000-strong army to attack Luoyang. Emperor Hui appointed Sima Yi as Grand Marshal to counter them. The two sides battled for months, with Sima Yi briefly routing Sima Yong and Sima Ying, killing tens of thousands.  

In early 304 CE, taking advantage of Sima Yi's exhausted forces, Sima Yue (the final prince among the eight), then serving as Minister of Works, colluded with palace guards to capture Sima Yi and hand him over to Sima Yong's general. Sima Yi was executed by being burned alive, allowing the rebellion to persist.  

With Sima Yi gone, Sima Ying and Sima Yue easily captured Luoyang. Sima Ying became Crown Prince-Imperial and returned to his fief in Ye to control the court remotely. Sima Yue, resenting Sima Ying's autocracy, assembled over 100,000 troops and led Emperor Hui to attack Ye. Defeated, Sima Yue fled back to Donghai. Sima Ying then sought to attack Sima Yue's brother, Sima Teng, with both sides allying with Xiongnu and Xianbei forces—marking the beginning of the Western Jin's self-destruction, as the "Five Barbarians" were not invading but invited in by the princes' infighting. Sima Ying was routed and fled back to Luoyang. His former ally Sima Yong, seeing his decline, stripped him of the Crown Prince-Imperial title. To curry favor with Sima Yue's advancing forces, Sima Yong even beheaded his own general Zhang Fang and sent the head to Sima Yue. Yet Sima Yue continued his attack, eventually killing Sima Yong and Sima Ying.  

Though Sima Yue emerged as the final victor, his end was equally grim. After seizing power, he continued to purge rivals, only to be threatened by the rising Xiongnu Han state. He died of fright while fleeing, his 100,000-strong entourage massacred by Han pursuers, and his corpse dismembered—deemed the instigator of the realm's chaos.  


### The Fall of the Ming Dynasty: Factional Strife and Internal Collapse  
The late Ming Dynasty also exemplified the late-stage ethnic cancerization. The most prominent characteristic of the civil and military officials of the Southern Ming was their incompetence against external enemies yet proficiency in internal infighting, manifesting in two ways: First, they prioritized personal interests over "defending the state," squandering energy and resources on power struggles; second, many readily surrendered to the Qing or fled, and after defecting, actively attacked remaining Ming forces and civilians.  

Factional power-grabbing among Southern Ming officials began after news of Emperor Chongzhen's death and the Crown Prince's capture reached Nanjing. Broadly, the conflict pitted the Jiangnan bureaucrats (represented by Donglin faction figures like Qian Qianyi) against the阉党 (eunuch faction) and non-Jiangnan officials (like Ma Shiying of Guiyang). The Jiangnan gentry, fearing retribution from the Prince of Fu (Zhu Yousong) due to past conflicts with the Donglin, supported the more virtuous Prince of Lu (Zhu Changfang). The Donglin's rivals—the阉党 (including Ruan Dacheng) and non-Jiangnan officials—advocated "installing the closest kin," backing the Prince of Fu.  

Nanjing's Minister of War, Shi Kefa, and the military governor of Fengyang, Ma Shiying, initially proposed a compromise: enthroning the Prince of Gui (not of the Fu line) with the Prince of Lu as "ancient marshal" to command troops. This plan won Jiangnan gentry support. However, events shifted when Ma Shiying learned that the Prince of Fu's faction—including eunuch Lu Jiude and generals Gao Jie, Huang Degong, and Liu Liangzuo—intended to install the Prince of Fu. Recognizing an opportunity to align with the new sovereign, Ma Shiying reversed course, formally declaring support for the Prince of Fu in the name of the Fengyang governorship and three military commands. He also informed the Prince of Fu that Shi Kefa had criticized his character and opposed his accession.  

Outmaneuvered by Ma Shiying's political tactics and lacking military power, the Jiangnan gentry and Shi Kefa accepted the fait accompli. Former阉党 figures like Ruan Dacheng, long at odds with the Donglin, eagerly aligned with the Prince of Fu-Ma Shiying faction, solidifying the Southern Ming's factional landscape.  

After betraying Shi Kefa, Shi Kefa requested command of troops to garrison Huai'an and Yangzhou. With Shi Kefa gone, Ma Shiying, Liu Kongzhao, and others acted with greater impunity. Ma Shiying's motives were clear: as an outsider with military power in Jiangnan (the Donglin's stronghold), he initially cooperated with Shi Kefa to support the Prince of Gui, currying favor with the Jiangnan gentry. But if he could install the Prince of Fu—also an outsider to the Jiangnan gentry—he would become the new sovereign's trusted confidant, enabling them to jointly suppress local forces.  

Rather than focusing on defending against the Qing, the Prince of Fu-Ma Shiying faction and the阉党 prioritized political vendettas. In December 1644 (Chongzhen 17th year), former阉党 member Yang Weiyuan demanded the reissuance of *Compilation of the Three Reigns* (*San Chao Yao Dian*), claiming the Donglin had distorted history in the Ming's "Three Great Cases." He called for posthumous rehabilitation of officials wronged in these cases, and Emperor Hongguang (the Prince of Fu) ordered the text retrieved and compiled into official histories. These policies had nothing to do with national survival—they were purely power-grabbing. Meanwhile, some Donglin figures engaged in similar behavior.  

Amid this factional strife, the Southern Ming court's collective cooperation capacity plummeted, internal losses from grabbing (per the Law of Grabbing Deficit) became catastrophic, and the final opportunity to resist the Qing was squandered. As Emperor Yongzheng remarks in *The Yongzheng Dynasty*: "For those in their faction, they shield regardless of merit; against those not in their faction, they attack regardless of virtue. They treat factional survival as life itself, disregarding the greater good." This encapsulates the plight of many dynasties on the brink of collapse.
