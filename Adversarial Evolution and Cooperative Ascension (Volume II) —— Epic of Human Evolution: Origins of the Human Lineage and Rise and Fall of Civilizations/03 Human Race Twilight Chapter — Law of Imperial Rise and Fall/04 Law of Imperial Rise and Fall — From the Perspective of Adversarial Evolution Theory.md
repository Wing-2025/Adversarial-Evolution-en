# The Law of Imperial Rise and Fall—Viewing the Law of Imperial Rise and Fall from the Perspective of Adversarial Evolution  
Through the analysis in the previous section, we can generally outline the internal laws governing the rise and fall of empires (first excluding the scenarios of Group Grabbingism and Group Hypocrisyism). The initial community emerges victorious from group competition, defeats nearly all rivals within a region, achieves unification of that region, and gradually reaches its peak. Due to the lack of effective cancer-suppression mechanisms, individuals continuously degenerate and undergo Individual Cancerization, ultimately leading the entire system to perish. The primary factors underlying the Law of Historical Cycles—barbarian invasions and the alternation of imperial rise and fall—have been highly refined in the simulation program "Human Origins and Imperial Rise-Fall Simulation" in the previous volume. Here, we will review them in contrast.  

## The Law of Historical Cycles in the Adversarial Evolution Simulation Program  
This is a game involving Grabbingists, Tit-for-Tat individuals, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists (GVBE), and Hypocrites. The basic principles of this game are simple, following several rules:  
1. **Self-Cultivationism genetic individuals (Concern Only Oneself):** They do not proactively interact with other genetic individuals, neither altruistic nor grabbing.  
2. **Grabbingism genetic individuals (Gangster):** When encountering individuals of any genetic type, they consume a small amount of their own energy to seize a large amount of energy from the opponent. They are particularly adept at seizing benefits from Self-Cultivationism individuals.  
3. **Tit-for-Tat genetic individuals (Tit-for-Tat):** When encountering individuals of the same genetic type or Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genetic individuals, they sacrifice a small amount of their own energy to bring a significant energy boost to the opponent (Cooperative Dividend). Conversely, they engage in reverse grabbing against genetic types that grab from them—sacrificing a small amount of energy to seize a large amount from the opponent.  
4. **Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists (GVBE, Good for Virtue, Bad for Evil):** When encountering other GVBE individuals, they are willing to make significant sacrifices to help the opponent gain substantial energy benefits (substantial Cooperative Dividend). When encountering Tit-for-Tat genetic individuals, they reduce their contributions; when encountering Grabbingism genetic individuals, they consume a certain amount of energy to punish the Grabbingism individuals, reducing their energy value.  
5. **Hypocrisyism individuals (Hypocrite):** They deceive GVBE individuals into treating them as other GVBE individuals—receiving unconditional help. However, because Tit-for-Tat individuals are relatively "short-sighted" and only reciprocate those who have helped them regardless of genetic type, Hypocrites gain little from Tit-for-Tat individuals.

</div>  

Based on the above settings, we initialize individuals as Self-Cultivationism. Each individual then randomly moves, reproduces, undergoes genetic mutation, and interacts with others. Ultimately, individuals with higher energy levels have a higher probability of survival.

</p>  

As the program runs according to the above settings, we record the number of individuals of each type. As shown in the figure below, the top blue line represents total population, the red line represents the number of GVBE individuals, and the periwinkle line represents the number of Hypocrites. As the figure shows, the program operates according to these rules, and the total population of the empire undergoes a regular wave-like cycle.

</p>  

[When there are more GVBE individuals and the Cooperative Dividend is significant, the population rises rapidly; at this time, the surplus of Cooperative Dividend creates vast space for the development of Hypocrisyism. As Hypocrites increase, GVBE genes undergo Reverse Selection, and the golden age supported by Cooperative Dividend begins to collapse. An era of chaos marked by mutual grabbing and severe internal strife ensues, and the population plummets due to internal disorders and external group pressure. However, at this point, more pure Grabbingism will eliminate Hypocrisyism (i.e., the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression), and Hypocrisyism individuals—who consume high energy due to their brains and deception—will gradually be eliminated by the natural environment. When the population is sparse and Hypocrisyism is mostly eliminated, GVBE genetic individuals once again achieve notable success through small-scale familial cooperation, rise anew, and the population climbs again, entering the next cycle. This reflects the core essence of the Law of Historical Cycles.]()  

This chart bears significant similarity to the graph of China’s population changes.

</p>  

[The cycle of imperial rise and fall is essentially, within an empire, a cycle of Grabbingism → Tit-for-Tat → Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism → Hypocrisyism → Advanced Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism → Advanced Hypocrisyism → Grabbingism, combined with a cycle of Group Selection through competition with neighboring imperial groups.]()  

Notably, [this simulation program does not require separate modeling of Group Selection; by simply designing passes between different empires, this inherent Group Selection will automatically produce effects.]() This experiment further confirms that [even without explicit group organization, weak Group Selection will emerge spontaneously based on localized geographical regularities.]()  

When GVBE genes migrate to a country dominated by Grabbingism, due to the barrenness of the land and the scarcity of GVBE individuals (insufficient to sustain Hypocrites), GVBE individuals will rapidly thrive. Conversely, regions originally dominated by GVBE may become prone to more Hypocrisyism due to excessive prosperity. As a result, peripheral empires gradually rise, while established empires decline. Thus, empires in different regions exhibit an alternating pattern of rise and fall. For example, the empire in the upper-left corner enters a period of prosperity:  

<p align="center">  
<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a217a2b7-99ff-4306-bfca-00b02eb7caa3" />  
</p>  

After a period, it enters a decline due to the proliferation of Hypocrites, while the empires in the lower-left and lower-right corners enter their own periods of prosperity.  

<p align="center">  
<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12328cd2-a928-4cd7-a2a7-32128656be34" />  
</p>  

Another example: the empire in the lower-right corner rises first:  

<p align="center">

</p>  

When it declines due to Hypocrites, the other empires thrive because of GVBE individuals who have migrated there.

</p>  

The above simplified program simulates the internal causes and laws of imperial rise and fall, as well as the continuous replacement of central empires by peripheral ones. Next, we will describe the details of this process more concretely.  

## Rise Through Group Selection; Fall Through Virtue Selection Failure and Cancerous Grabbing  
As we have repeatedly discussed, group competition is a critical component in forming the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism. A morally corrupt group with internal strife is easily defeated when competing with a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism group (here, we first ignore Group Grabbingism and Group Hypocrisyism for simplified understanding). For barbarians, when they are weak, they often exist in a state of multi-group competition (since barbarian polities are mostly decentralized rather than centralized, and long-term group competition persists among different tribes). When a tribe emerges victorious from this multi-group competition—such as the "unification of the grasslands" seen repeatedly in history (e.g., Tuoba Gui unifying the grasslands to establish the Northern Wei, Genghis Khan unifying the grasslands to establish the Mongol Empire, Nurhaci unifying the Jurchens to establish the Qing Dynasty)—these achievements largely reflect the victory of their group’s cooperative capabilities. Such peripheral ethnic groups with stronger cooperative capabilities, though smaller in population and scale, gain the strength to challenge a decadent and declining Central Plains dynasty.  

In contrast, after their establishment, Central Plains dynasties—particularly in East Asia—often become superpowers, with populations and resources unmatched by neighboring groups. Subjectively, they lose the sense of urgency for group competition; objectively, they lose the Group Selection mechanism—even if they become highly decadent, no other group can easily challenge their dominance due to their sheer scale. Only when powerful ethnic minorities emerge and the Central Plains empire has decayed to the point of extreme internal strife can a small group overcome a large one.

When barbarian tribes were small in size and surrounded by powerful adversaries, their leaders often dedicated themselves to governance with diligence, demonstrated astute judgment in selecting talents, and shared weal and woe with their subjects. For a leader who failed to act thus—or a group lacking such a leader—decline would ensue rapidly; they could not even secure their own internal stability, let alone compete for dominance over the Central Plains. Moreover, it was generally insufficient to have merely one generation of virtuous rulers; at least three consecutive generations of capable leaders (or at minimum, none conspicuously inadequate) were required. The entire ruling clique also needed to comprise individuals of both moral integrity and competence, rather than being consumed by infighting and scheming. Only then could such groups defeat the great Central Plains states and establish relatively long-lasting dynasties. Groups with only sporadic heroic figures—like Liu Yuan of the Han-Zhao state, Fu Jian of the Former Qin, or Yang Jian of the Sui Dynasty—faded as fleeting blossoms. Thus, the establishment of a stable and powerful dynasty was in fact an event of minuscule probability, the outcome of relentless competition and natural selection among dozens of groups, with a success rate of perhaps 1-2%. For example, from the chaos of the late Jin Dynasty, through the "Five Barbarians Invading the Central Plains," the successive changes of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the power struggles of the Sui-Tang era, over a hundred groups vied for supremacy. The Tang Dynasty founded by the Li clan emerged as the ultimate victor from this prolonged competition, meaning its creation of a new golden age was the result of extended group selection and preparation. In this process, the corruption and cancerous genes of preceding dynasties were to some extent purged. [As we proposed in the previous volume, Group Selection constitutes the Individual Selection of the next dimension. During periods of chaos, the units of Group Selection are precisely the clans and ethnic groups represented by these regional warlords. Groups with stronger cooperative capabilities and fewer hypocritical schemers within their ranks stood a higher chance of success, while their opposites faced greater likelihood of elimination.]  

How, then, did these small barbarian groups that overcame larger powers descend into corruption after unifying the empire? Once they defeated the Central Plains states and eliminated their greatest external threat, [the mechanism of Group Selection was interrupted]. Political contradictions shifted from external to internal. The imperial family and meritorious officials began to maneuver, each伺机 (lying in wait) to seize power. At this juncture, the moral caliber of the group became critical. For groups with low moral standards, these contradictions erupted swiftly—sometimes even before full unification, while external enemies still loomed—dooming such groups to ephemeral regimes. For groups with higher moral standards, where internal power struggles were more constrained, these conflicts were delayed until after unification, or even several generations later. At this point, corruption set in within the imperial line. Grabbing-oriented degeneration is inherently prone to occur, and among the imperial heirs, it is often those adept at flattery, intrigue, and infighting who prevail. Within a few generations, the legacy of the founding ancestors—arduous enterprise, sagacious talent selection, and benevolence toward the people—vanishes entirely.  

Peasant uprisings follow similar logic. However, since they occur within Han Chinese territories, where hypocrisy and grabbing-oriented culture runs deeper than among barbarians, this transformation often completes even before "sinicization." Many rebel leaders already exhibit hypocrisy and grabbing tendencies (e.g., Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang, who began purging meritorious officials and consolidating power after seizing the throne). A peasant uprising capable of shaking a dynasty typically arises during its terminal corruption, when popular discontent is near-universal. For example, Li Zicheng initially sought only to plunder wealth and return to Shaanxi; the suddenness of his victory left his faction entirely unprepared to govern the nation. Such groups may not possess high internal cooperation, but they often surpass the decrepit imperial forces in cohesion, and their sheer size grants them the strength to topple the old order.  

Even if founding emperors themselves remain steadfast in their original ideals, within the already corrupt cultural sphere of the old empire, their descendants face a high probability of succumbing to desires for centralized grabbing. Moreover, with social trust shattered, mutual suspicion, and preemptive strikes the norm, emperors confront a dilemma: failure to centralize power risks usurpation, as historical precedents abound. This fear further drives the motivation and necessity for centralization.  

What follows centralized autocracy? The pressure of dimensional collapse persists, and the probability of cancerization (Individual Cancerization) continues to rise. Even a slight misstep by a successor may trigger grabbing-oriented degeneration, reducing them to short-sighted 3-dimensional beings preoccupied with hedonism. Once such desires take root, they will easily find hypocritical agents skilled in grabbing within the old imperial bureaucracy. Emperors often enlist such hypocrites (e.g., consort clans, eunuchs, sycophants)—despite opposition from the original barbarian tribe’s virtue-upholding members—to achieve autocratic centralization through unrighteous means. Yet these grabbing-oriented agents are far from docile; their ambitions and methods are unconstrained. The original virtue-upholding noble class, opposing this process (triggering the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism), may delay corruption for a time, hence the initial "golden ages" of many dynasties. However, without the pressure of inter-group competition, the adversarial evolutionary forces of internal grabbing—like air and water—pervade all. Virtue-upholding individuals are gradually eroded, and they and their descendants fare poorly in political struggles dominated by hypocrisy and grabbing. Thus, the genetic composition of the ruling class undergoes a slow transformation—becoming increasingly hypocritical and grabbing-oriented.  

The corruption of an empire manifests primarily in the moral degradation of all strata (especially the ruling class), internal grabbing infighting, and the collapse of the Virtue Selection mechanism. Symptoms include factional strife, sycophancy, scheming, weakening of the populace, extravagance, and corruption. All these behaviors generate no social value while incurring massive internal group losses, squandering cooperative dividends and inflicting severe grabbing deficits. [This discrepancy results in the overall fitness of a vast empire actually falling below that of an energetic, upwardly mobile "barbarian" state.]  

Another critical trend: by selecting hypocritical schemers to aid in grabbing, the proportion of insidious grabbing-oriented individuals in the decision-making clique increases over time. For example, during Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s later reign, favoritism toward Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong corrupted the court, while the proportion of virtue-upholding officials (represented by capable chancellors) declined. Within this clique, the Virtue Selection mechanism erodes—while "Evil Selection" intensifies, as seen in the wrongful deaths of Yue Fei and Yuan Chonghuan. This process gives rise to the "Reverse Selection" phenomenon often lamented during dynastic decline.  

Behind the flourishing and prosperity of an empire’s ascent lies the collapse of its "Virtue Selection" immune system—the pillar of the human life community—allowing cancerous cells to run rampant. The empire’s demise is thus predetermined decades in advance. This Law of Historical Cycles remains nearly insurmountable without fundamental political reform. [Even with significant advancements in modern political systems, which have improved the "brain cancerization" (i.e., ruling clique cancerization) problem, the broader issue of systemic cancerization remains unresolved—indeed, few even care to confront this dire predicament.]

## Group Competition "Requires" Grabbing Genes in Leadership  
As briefly discussed in the previous volume, due to the demands of inter-group competition, groups are compelled to select decision-making teams and ruling classes with grabbing tendencies. This serves two purposes: to enhance their chances of victory in competition, and to guard against being outmaneuvered by the other side’s insidious grabbing tactics. Leaders of virtuous intent who adhere to rules, by contrast, are prone to disadvantage in ruleless group competition. Consequently, most victorious leaders in group competition exhibit grabbing proclivities. Examples include the cruelty of the Qin Kings, Liu Bang’s cunning and betrayal, Cao Cao’s "better I wrong the world," and the capriciousness and brutality of Zhu Yuanzhang, Zhu Di, and others. Not to mention figures like Shi Hu of Later Zhao, Ran Min of Ran Wei, Gao Yang of Northern Qi, Attila the Hun, and Ivan IV of Russia’s Rurik Dynasty—though tyrannical at home, their external plunder benefited their groups to some extent. Even great military and political figures like Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Caesar, Augustus, Li Shimin, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon are not entirely free of grabbing stigma.  

Moreover, the ruling class generally enjoys genetic advantages. Royal families and nobles thus tend to be the first within a group to corrupt, rapidly propagating their grabbing-oriented genetic strategies downward, transforming into a group-wide malignancy. A 2012 psychological study of 42 U.S. presidents found nearly half exhibited pronounced Dark Triad Personality traits (narcissism, unscrupulousness, psychopathy). Similarly, New York psychologist Paul Babiak’s research on business elites revealed 21% of surveyed supply chain managers displayed clinical Dark Triad traits, compared to just 1% in the general population.  

This pattern is not absolute, however. There exist leaders—such as Scipio, Muhammad, Joan of Arc, Alexander Nevsky, George Washington, Murong Ke, Chai Rong, Yue Fei, Qi Jiguang, Sun Yat-sen, and Mao Zedong—who shine both in personal morality and achievements. Yet precisely because of their righteousness and selflessness, they are rarely aggressive (acting primarily in self-defense), produce fewer heirs, and their successors face pressures of sacrifice and Reverse Selection. [This dilemma fundamentally stems from humanity’s failure to establish a robust Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism.] Until such a mechanism is in place, humanity will struggle to truly escape the grasp of Grabbingism.

## Petty Rascals Are Conquered by Greater Rascals—The Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression

Grabbing knows no bounds. According to the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression, it begins with a politician trading the life of an upright minister for personal gain; next, a politician may sacrifice the lives of a group of commoners to secure their rise, displacing the former; then, another may wager imperial territories for their own ascent, surpassing the previous; and ultimately, there emerge politicians who would gamble the fate of the entire empire to advance themselves. They would rather see their entire ethnic group be trampled and destroyed tomorrow than forgo eliminating rivals today, chasing a fleeting "reign of arrogance." These grabbing individuals may form cliques, creating Grabbing Clans to resist Virtue Selection Judgments or attack other grabbing factions. They compete in who is more unprincipled, who employs crueler tactics, who acts more convincingly, and who has fewer moral boundaries. In the end, the once-mighty empire teeters on the brink of collapse. The core logic is: [a scoundrel with moral boundaries will inevitably be eliminated by a scoundrel without boundaries; and a scoundrel without boundaries will in turn be eliminated by an even more unscrupulous and short-sighted scoundrel.]()  

#### The Short-Sighted Progression Chain of Han Fei, Ying Zheng, Li Si, Hu Hai, and Zhao Gao—Qin Dynasty’s Decline  
Such examples are countless in the later stages of dynastic eras. Take Han Fei, the consummate Legalist thinker, who taught rulers how to govern through power tactics, guard against family and ministers, consolidate authority, and bind people through penal laws. Though Han Fei opened the Pandora’s box of Legalism, his personal character and academic achievements were unimpeachable; his theories even originated from a desire to restore order in chaotic times. Yet his bounded principles doomed him to be destroyed by a more unprincipled schemer—his classmate Li Si. Fearful that Han Fei’s superior talent might replace him, Li Si told King Ying Zheng: “Han Fei is a prince of Han. Now that Your Majesty intends to annex the states, Han Fei will ultimately act in Han’s interest, not Qin’s. This is only natural. If you do not employ him but let him linger in Qin and then return, you court future disaster. It is better to eliminate him by law.” This rationale was thoroughly “Legalist,” leaving Ying Zheng with no grounds to refuse. Thus, Ying Zheng—who had already abandoned ritual propriety (his moral boundaries)—killed the envoy Han Fei. Ying Zheng spent his life believing he benefited from Legalism, yet he ultimately fell victim to it. After his death, intending to install Fusu as the new emperor (though evidence remains inconclusive), the more unprincipled Li Si conspired with Zhao Gao to forge the imperial edict, killing Crown Prince Fusu. Many remember Ying Zheng as the First Emperor who unified China, but few recognize him as the “foolish ruler” who doomed Qin’s five-hundred-year legacy. Later, Qin’s Second Emperor, Hu Hai, furthered the people’s suffering by conscripting labor to build the Epang Palace. As anti-Qin uprisings surged, Li Si, along with Prime Minister Qu Ji and General Feng Jie, urged Hu Hai to halt the palace construction and reduce corvée—showing that even Li Si, though unprincipled, retained enough foresight to see the empire’s impending collapse. [Yet this residual foresight and reason became his weakness.]() After Li Si was imprisoned, his multiple petitions were intercepted by Zhao Gao, who falsely accused Li Si and his son Li You of rebellion. Under torture, Li Si was forced to confess. In 208 BCE, he was腰斩, and his entire family executed. Zhao Gao’s power tactics were masterful, manipulating Li Si and Hu Hai to seize authority, even “calling a deer a horse.” Yet his actions were a “last hurrah” wagered on the empire’s fate. After his maneuvers, Qin rapidly crumbled, and Zhao Gao himself met a violent end, executed by Ziying with his family. Some later claimed Zhao Gao was a prince of Zhao, entering Qin’s court to avenge his homeland—history abounds with such tales, like Jin Zhun of Liu Han. Regardless of truth, one fact remains clear: [without the protection of the Virtue Selection Mechanism, from the perspective of individual competition alone, grabbing individuals being eliminated by more unscrupulous, short-sighted grabbers is an almost inevitable trend. The only means to counteract this entropic degeneration and prevent a mutually destructive outcome is none other than the Virtue Selection Mechanism.]()  

#### Using Scoundrels to Fight Scoundrels  
In many historical instances, grabbing scoundrels rise to power for one reason: the needs of political factional struggles. Initially, these scoundrels lack opportunities to enter the stage; both sides of the conflict disdain them. Yet as struggles grow more ruthless, using upright individuals cannot defeat the opponent, so scoundrels are reluctantly employed. For example, during Emperor Gaozong of Tang’s reign, to counter the Guanlong noble clique led by Zhangsun Wuji and consolidate imperial power, he first appointed upright ministers like Zhang Xingcheng and Li Ji. Yet their unfamiliarity with intrigue and framing made them ineffective. Gaozong was then forced to rely on scoundrels like Li Yifu, Xu Jingzong, and Yuan Gongyu. Li Yifu, for instance, coined the phrase “a smile hiding a dagger.”  

#### Killing with a Borrowed Blade and Then Sacrificing the Blade—Chaos of a Dying Era  
It is known that the Western Jin Dynasty fell to the Rebellion of the Eight Princes, which originated from Jia Nanfeng’s political chaos. Some blame Emperor Wu of Jin (Sima Yan), but the true cause was the cancerization of the entire ruling class—and even the nation. Sima Yan faced a doomed outcome regardless of his choice: selecting imperial relatives led to the Rebellion of the Eight Princes; choosing consorts’ relatives would have caused a Lü Clan Rebellion; appointing frontier generals would have triggered an An Lushan-style rebellion. Emperor Qianlong later summarized that feudal lords, foreign threats, powerful ministers, consorts’ clans, empresses, eunuchs, treacherous officials, and scoundrels could all topple a dynasty. Yet these are mere symptoms; the root cause is the cancerization of the ruling class (the “brain”) and the entire body politic. In reality, Western Jin’s decline combined consort clan interference, royal infighting, and frontier generals declaring independence. On his deathbed, Sima Yan was coerced by powerful minister Yang Jun and his daughter, Empress Yang Zhi, into granting Yang Jun sole authority. Yet their moral boundaries and cruelty paled beside another consort clan member—Jia Nanfeng. Jia Nanfeng’s entry into the court as crown princess and later empress owed much to Yang Yan (Yang Zhi’s sister) advocating for her. Ugly and crude, she once struck pregnant concubines’ abdomens with a halberd to cause miscarriages, nearly being deposed were it not for Yang Zhi’s intercession. To seize power, Jia Nanfeng invented a timeless stratagem: “killing with a borrowed blade and then sacrificing the blade.” First, she exploited tensions between consort clans and royal families, allying with Prince Sima Liang of Runan and Prince Sima Wei of Chu to lead a military campaign against Yang Jun. Sima Wei agreed, entered the capital, and executed Yang Jun. Jia then, ungrateful, deposed Empress Yang Zhi as a commoner, imprisoning her in Jinyong City until she starved. Power then fell to Sima Liang and Sima Wei, which was never Jia’s goal. She next exploited their rivalry, forging an edict ordering Sima Wei to execute Sima Liang and Wei Guan, the regents. Though Sima Wei was wary, the chance to eliminate rivals proved irresistible—he killed both. Unbeknownst to him, Jia then accused Sima Wei of forging the edict, executing him as well. Through trickery, forged edicts, betrayal, and reneging on promises, the “demonic empress” Jia Nanfeng manipulated these princes and ministers. While even thieves adhere to codes, Jia disregarded all political norms, acting with reckless abandon. In a struggle void of Virtue Selection, lawlessness proved invincible. Yet such figures are fated to perish in the same权谋 (power games). Later, Sima Lun employed the same “kill with a borrowed blade, then sacrifice the blade” tactic against Jia herself. Sima Lun exploited the conflict between the deposed Crown Prince Sima Yu and Jia, spreading rumors that the palace planned to depose Jia and reinstall Sima Yu. Fearful, Jia forged an edict to poison Sima Yu. When he refused, she had him killed. Sima Lun thus eliminated his chief rival for the throne, advancing his path to becoming crown prince. He also deposed Jia, mirroring her treatment of Sima Wei—forging an edict to strip her of power and poison her in Jinyong City. Interestingly, Pan An, the “most handsome man of the millennium” who had aligned with the Yang and Jia clans, endured the power struggles only to be executed with his family.  

#### Virtue Selection Destroyed, None Are Spared  
This pattern recurs in later dynastic declines: Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong of Tang, Cai Jing of Northern Song, Qin Hui of Southern Song, Yan Song of Ming—all once reached the apex of the unscrupulous grabbing food chain. Take late Ming: Emperor Chongzhen, a rare ruler with ambition, executed the infamous Wei Zhongxian. Yet the Donglin faction proved even more incompetent, rushing to grab benefits without regard for the greater good—leaving the situation worse than under Wei, who at least considered some broader interests. The Donglin’s once-virtuous leaders had already been purged by prior eunuch grabbing factions. When Chongzhen hanged himself, he lamented in his final words: “Treacherous ministers have doomed me.” Previous grabbing factions had torn the court apart; by late Ming, the government and society were a festering tumor. Even a sage emperor could not have saved it.

The actions of these treacherous officials appear supremely foolish to outsiders. For their own gain, they distort facts, call a deer a horse, persecute dissenters, and recklessly squander their power and political maneuvers, seemingly "unrivaled" within the group. Yet they all sacrifice national interests, pushing a nation already teetering on the brink of collapse into even graver peril. Such boundless conduct often swiftly leads to the fall of the state and ruin of the family. No egg remains intact when the nest is overturned—these grabbing fanatics themselves meet similarly tragic fates. Their behavior utterly defies the basic principles of "selfish genes"; they are the most radical cancer cells, mutated from those with even a shred of restraint. After a brief outburst of caprice and fanaticism, they rapidly drag high-dimensional life toward extinction.  

[But we must understand: in the absence of a robust Virtue Selection Mechanism, such boundless, short-sighted grabbing individuals are inevitably selected. They are chosen by milder grabbing elements, who first subvert the Virtue Selection Mechanism but cannot defeat the boundless grabbers. In turn, these boundless grabbers are always outcompeted by even more short-sighted, unrestrained ones. Ultimately, these final grabbers derive pleasure from grabbing alone—daily scheming to flatter superiors, oppress inferiors, persecute dissenters, expand power, cultivate sycophants, and wield tyranny. Their thought patterns elude ordinary comprehension; even as they clearly march toward self-destruction, they refuse to halt. Were they to stop, they would swiftly be destroyed by more extreme grabbers, making those latter the new protagonists of the story, for the more short-sighted grabbers eliminate them.]  

[Of course, this scenario hinges on the prior destruction of just, virtue-upholding forces by milder grabbers, creating a climate of stifled dissent. This is how the progression of grabbing unfolds—among individuals, among nations. Grabbing progresses, ceasing only with annihilation.]  

[Thus, under the dominion of the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression, the simplest, most brutal way to avoid and resist grabbing is to grab without greater restraint. The endpoint of politics and power wielded through grabbing is ultimate short-sightedness and collective ruin.]  

[Those who fail to fathom this inevitable trend of grabbing progression, who cannot take preventive measures, who cannot extricate themselves from history’s turbulent currents and instead are swept along to fan its flames—these cannot be called wise.]  

Pan An and Wang Yan were no ordinary figures. Pan An, with his peerless beauty, profound talent, and unwavering filial piety, hailed from a noble lineage. Yet to preserve his life, he不分正邪 (aligned with power regardless of principle), ultimately meeting the fate of having three generations of his family executed. Wang Yan, for all his "three burrows of the crafty hare" strategy, still perished beneath history’s cancerous tide. [On his deathbed, Wang Yan finally understood: "Alas! Though we may not match the ancients, had we not promoted empty rhetoric but instead strived to rectify the realm, we would not have fallen to this state."]  

Death alone is not to be feared—it is better than the execution of three generations. Yet the fall of a nation, akin to the annihilation of all its clans, is far more costly.  

### A Centipede’s Corpse: Dead Yet Uncollapsed  
When rulers choose to satisfy their personal grabbing ambitions, they ultimately forfeit the entire nation’s interests. Yet for rulers—founding emperors, for example—even if the nation is conquered and its people enslaved, they may still "profit"—for they sire countless descendants. After the chaos of war, subjugation, and persecution by the new dynasty, their genetic gains may still exceed what they would have achieved by refraining from grabbing. Such genetic benefits enable these genes to persist and even thrive amid dynastic cycles.  

This outcome is not absolute; it depends on group size. The larger the group, the greater the genetic gains a ruler reaps from extreme grabbing. For larger groups take longer to decay to the point of defeat by weaker neighboring peoples, allowing the ruler to sire more offspring. Similarly, other grabbers in the ruling class also produce more descendants.  

On the other hand, when large groups are defeated, though royal families are often executed by the new dynasty (the tradition of sparing conquered lineages long extinct), the sheer size of a Central Plain dynasty makes it impossible to enslave the entire defeated population as in primitive societies, or to erase the capital as Rome did Carthage. Instead, barbarian conquerors are sinicized or assimilated, employing Han officials and governing through Han systems. Many former court ministers simply switch loyalties. Thus, the evolutionary mechanisms and logic of ten millennia ago have been utterly transformed—the interests of a centralized emperor and his sycophants in a vast empire are too great. They seize the wealth of hundreds of millions for their own gain, with no effective mechanism to eliminate these cancerous genes. These carcinogenic genes are passed down through generations.  

Notably, this differs from cancer cells in three-dimensional life, which perish with their host. Cancer cells in four-dimensional life can survive across dynasties and ethnicities. New four-dimensional life forms, once parasitized, easily develop tumors and face existential danger. Hence, four-dimensional life often evolves a psychology of excluding foreign groups, akin to the human body’s rejection response—harboring suspicion or even discrimination toward outsiders. This ethnic discrimination partially curbs the rapid spread of foreign "tumors."  

### Stifling the People, Deceiving Above and Below  
Once a hypocritical, grabbing ruling class forms, policies to stifle and weaken the people, and suppress local self-governance, become evolutionary inevitabilities—for if they "naively" grant the people power or allow intellectual openness, their grabbing will face resistance or retribution, as seen in the French Revolution. If they "naively" empower local forces with armies and weapons, they will be devoured by those forces, as history’s lessons—such as the Rebellion of the Seven States in the early Han, the Rebellion of the Eight Kings in the Western Jin, and the Tang Dynasty’s collapse at the hands of regional governors—make clear. Thus, stifling the people, weakening them, and suppressing local self-governance are the only options for rulers to continue grabbing.  

This choice triggers another vicious cycle: as thoughtful citizens are repressed and those with a spirit of eradicating evil are silenced, the masses’ only remaining means of resistance is deception. This drives the populace to evolve in another direction—outward compliance and silence, but private acts of petty theft and selfishness. As Hobsbawm put it, this is ["minimizing the disadvantages of the system"].  

The cause of this evolutionary trend is clear: those who are absolutely obedient and genuine, or who resist upper evil, meet bad ends. As these genes are gradually eliminated, what remains are people who outwardly comply but secretly balance their losses through alternative grabbing. Such urban drifters often appear in later movements like the Taiping Rebellion and the Boxers. This is a foundational evolutionary trend that undermines a nation’s roots. Such patterns of "resisting violence with violence, grabbing with grabbing" further spread hypocritical grabbing genetic strategies on a large scale. This underlies the modern national character’s foundations and the phenomena Lu Xun angrily and sardonically criticized.  

With the elimination of relatively virtuous genetic strategies among the people, grabbing genes face even less inhibition from "Virtue Selection," spreading more wantonly. Along this evolutionary chain, we see that if "deceiving above" succeeds, "deceiving below" becomes an inevitable evolutionary outcome. Though the chain is long, it is tightly linked—without external intervention, it is nearly an inevitable evolutionary path. From "deceiving above" to "deceiving below," from "seizing above" to "grabbing below," such local human societies rarely escape the grabbing cycle.  

Hypocrisyism, amid millennia of human societal upheaval, has found new avenues to undermine the evolutionarily stable state of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Just as the God of Righteous Order achieves unprecedented feats, the God of Chaos presents a colossal challenge that could undo it all.  

### Short-Lived vs. Long-Lived Empires  
Due to differing rates of cancerization, empires generally fall into two categories: short-lived empires, where the ruling class rapidly cancerizes, and long-lived empires, which delay ruling-class cancerization. Yet even long-lived empires cannot ultimately avoid total cancerization, and their collapse may be more thorough. For example, the Qin and Sui dynasties fell due to the ruling class’s early corruption, while the Zhou and Roman Empires collapsed from systemic decay.

Though their lifespans differ, all empires ultimately succumb to decline.
