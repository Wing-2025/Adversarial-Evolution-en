# The Dusk of Humanity: The Law of Imperial Rise and Fall  

Throughout human history, countless dynasties have risen and fallen, and ethnic groups have ascended and declined. The vast majority of dynasties, as described by Zuo Qiuming and Mr. Huang Yanpei, follow the pattern of "their rise is swift, their fall is sudden"—a dynasty flourishes vigorously in its ascent, yet collapses abruptly in its decline. People have tirelessly pondered the causes of these dynastic vicissitudes. Some even summarize this phenomenon as a historical paradox: "A highly developed civilization will ultimately be destroyed by a relatively backward and barbaric one." Superficially, this conclusion holds true across both ancient and modern times, and in both Chinese and foreign contexts. What, then, are the underlying laws governing imperial rise and fall, and the intrinsic principles behind ethnic ascension and decline? Does such a law exist? Who determines rise and fall? Is there a pattern to prosperity and decline?  

Today, many major powers around the world are approaching the two-to-three-century mark of national longevity, with mounting conflicts and contradictions emerging among nations. Economic, social, and livelihood issues are accumulating increasingly. The topic of imperial rise and fall and ethnic ascension and decline is well worth revisiting and deeply exploring. In this chapter, we will systematically examine this process using the new analytical tool of Adversarial Evolution.  

# What Drives the Law of Historical Cycles  

Let us begin with Chinese history as our entry point. Many have noted that Chinese history has long been trapped in a cyclical pattern of order and chaos. Most dynasties start with political clarity and prosperity, with each era witnessing "a golden age" or "a period of governance." After two to three centuries of development, however, they inevitably slide into corruption and decline. Even if a few virtuous ministers or wise emperors emerge to temporarily reverse the trend and create a "period of revival," they rarely alter the overarching trajectory of decline. When decay reaches its peak, the dynasty is overthrown by small peripheral ethnic groups or massive uprisings of the common people, restarting the cycle of order and chaos. This phenomenon is known as the "Law of Historical Cycles of Order and Chaos in China."  

Throughout history, people have analyzed the causes and sought patterns behind this phenomenon. Some attribute it to the quality of emperors; others to climatic disasters like the "Little Ice Age"; still others to land annexation. From another angle, there is the question: [Why do barbarians defeat civilizations?]()  

In the history of ancient East Asia, a distinct pattern has persisted: since the Western Jin Dynasty, dynasties established in the Central Plains have often been suppressed or replaced by northern nomadic peoples. From the perspective of Central Plains dynasties, this constitutes invasions by northern barbarians. Examples include the "Invasion of the Five Barbarians" (when nomadic groups such as the Xiongnu, Xianbei, Jie, Qiang, and Di established non-Han regimes in the north, confronting Han regimes in the south) and the "Disaster of Yongjia" (when Xiongnu forces captured the Jin capital and emperor, leading to the fall of the Western Jin) during the late Western Jin; the "Humiliation of Jingkang" when the Jin Dynasty destroyed the Northern Song; and the Mongol Yuan Dynasty’s conquest of the Southern Song, followed by the Qing Dynasty’s defeat of the Shun and Southern Ming regimes to rule East Asia. Moreover, earlier barbarian dynasties in the Central Plains were often replaced by new northern nomadic groups—for instance, the Northern Wei (Xianbei) defeating the Former Qin (Di), the Jin defeating the Liao, and the Mongol Yuan defeating the Jin.  

Beyond obviously nomadic regimes like the Northern Wei, Eastern Wei, Western Wei, and Northern Zhou (Xianbei), Liao (Khitan), Jin (Jurchen), Western Xia (Tangut), Yuan (Mongol), and Qing (Manchu), dynasties such as the Northern Qi, Sui, and Tang, which appear Han-led, also have deep northern nomadic roots. Here, "northern nomadic roots" refer to the fact that these dynasties often relied on military systems, forces, and noble groups of non-Han origin at their founding. For example, the famous Sui-Tang Fubing (Militia) System originated from the tribal military structure led by the Eight Pillar Lords (military nobles) of the Western Wei Xianbei. The Sui-Tang royal families emerged from the Guanlong Group of the Northern Dynasties, a "mixed Han-nomadic, martial-civil" elite closely linked to the descendants of the Xianbei nobles who had migrated westward. Empress Dugu (Dugu Jialuo), wife of Emperor Wen of Sui (Yang Jian), was a daughter of Dugu Xin, one of the Western Wei’s Eight Pillar Lords and a Xianbei military noble; Yang Jian himself was the son of Yang Zhong, another pillar lord of the Northern Zhou, with the Xianbei surname Puliuru. Similarly, Li Bing, father of Li Yuan (founder of the Tang Dynasty), was a pillar lord of the Northern Zhou, and Li Hu, Li Yuan’s grandfather, was one of the Western Wei’s Eight Pillar Lords, with the Xianbei surname Daye. Li Yuan himself was a product of intermarriage within the Guanlong Group’s Han-nomadic military nobility—his mother, Lady Dugu, was the fourth daughter of Dugu Xin. Thus, while Li Yuan was in fact the cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (Yang Guang), the exact kinship is less important than their shared Northern Dynastic military noble background. In short, the primary forces supporting their rise to power remained "barbarian" in nature. (Much of the historical material in this chapter draws from Mr. Zhang Hongjie’s *A Concise History of China* and relevant articles by Mr. Su Ze published in *Du Jia*; specific citations are omitted hereinafter.)  

This pattern can even be traced back to the pre-Qin era, and even to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Qin’s unification of the Six States and King Wu’s conquest of the Shang can also be seen as victories of peripheral barbarians over Central Plains dynasties. The cyclical rise and fall of imperial civilizations has occurred not only repeatedly in China but also in ancient civilizations worldwide, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome—all of which were defeated by "barbarians" with lower cultural development and later origins. For example, ancient Egypt was conquered by the Greeks (Macedonians); ancient Greece was ruled by the later Romans; and Rome was destroyed by northern Germanic barbarians. However, this cycle of order and chaos has been more frequent and its patterns more pronounced in Chinese history.  

In my view, both the cycle of order and chaos and the phenomenon of barbarians defeating civilizations share a fundamentally similar essence. Thus, this chapter will collectively term them the "Law of Imperial Rise and Fall" for exploration. Let us first examine several common explanations of this phenomenon.  

### Huang Yanpei’s Law  

Regarding why Chinese history is trapped in cycles of order and chaos, there are multiple explanations. Traditional historical records, such as *Zizhi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government)* and the *Twenty-Four Histories*, attribute this to human willpower—or the quality of emperors. They argue that founding emperors, having risen through arduous struggle, were strong and wise leaders who established sound institutions and resolved many issues. Later emperors, however, were born and raised in the deep palace, coddled by women, growing increasingly weak and incompetent, leading to deteriorating governance and eventual collapse. This is known as "Huang Yanpei’s Law."  

During a conversation with Chairman Mao in Yan’an, Huang Yanpei stated: "The law of Chinese history is that 'their rise is swift, their fall is sudden.'" A dynasty rises with vigor and momentum, yet collapses quickly and haphazardly. No individual, family, group, region, or nation has escaped this cyclical force. In the early stages, all concentrate their efforts, leaving no task unexamined and no person uncommitted—perhaps because of the hardships endured, with survival wrested from near-annihilation. As conditions improve, however, vigilance wanes, inertia sets in, and the decline becomes irreversible.  

At first glance, Huang Yanpei’s argument seems plausible. Yet "Huang Yanpei’s Law" fails to explain why the early generations of a dynasty often witness golden ages and periods of good governance. Most rulers after the founding generation are indeed raised in the deep palace, coddled by women, yet early dynastic eras often see dedicated governance, while later eras struggle to reverse decline even with wise emperors. This explanation thus remains a summary of phenomena, rather than a clarification of underlying causes.  

### The Little Ice Age  

A second explanation points to climatic factors, suggesting that dynastic collapses in China often coincide with climatic disasters like the "Little Ice Age." Such disasters would leave the Central Plains scorched or flooded, driving starving people to revolt. Alternatively, severe snowstorms on the steppes might decimate livestock, forcing nomadic groups to migrate south in search of sustenance and overthrow Central Plains dynasties.  

This explanation holds some merit in specific cases—for example, the prolonged drought during the Chongzhen era of the late Ming Dynasty directly contributed to the peasant uprisings. However, as Mr. Qin Hui has noted, climate change is global; the "Little Ice Age" did not affect only China. Yet the rise and fall of Western civilizations and the order-chaos cycles of traditional China are not synchronized. While China experienced upheaval during the transition between the Han and Wei dynasties, the West enjoyed the "Pax Romana" (Roman Peace). When the West suffered its first major plague disaster around the 6th–7th centuries, China was in the "Reign of Zhenguan" (a golden age). Thus, climate cannot explain the once-every-100-to-200-year chaos in Chinese history. Climatic changes occasionally coincide with Chinese warfare, but they do not constitute a consistent historical law.  

### Land Annexation  

A third explanation is the theory of land annexation. This theory posits that at the start of each dynasty, peasant wars eliminate large numbers of landowners, redistributing land and improving peasant livelihoods, thereby creating golden ages. By the mid-to-late dynasty, however, wealth inequality and free land sales lead to severe land concentration, with most land owned by a few landlords, leaving the poor "without even a place to stick a needle" and forcing them to become tenant farmers.  

Recent historical research, however, has invalidated this claim. Historians have compiled extensive new data showing that, compared to other contemporary societies, traditional China did not suffer from extreme land inequality. Mr. Qin Hui’s studies of peasantry, analyzing numerous land registers from the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi, revealed "no landlords in Guanzhong." Instead, Guanzhong was dominated by smallholder farmers, with highly fragmented land ownership and few large landowners—a pattern consistent across both early and late dynastic periods.

This pattern was not unique to the Guanzhong region. Throughout Chinese history, owner-cultivators have consistently constituted a significant proportion of the population. Moreover, compared to other countries globally, historical land distribution in China has generally been relatively equitable—most nations have experienced greater land concentration than ancient China. The *General History of Modern China* compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences holds this view regarding the Qing Dynasty. According to this work, during the entire Qing period, two concurrent processes unfolded: "land consolidation" and "land fragmentation." On one hand, some individuals accumulated wealth, purchased more land, and ascended from the rank of peasant to landlord. On the other hand, wealthy families continuously divided their estates, transforming large landowners into smaller landowners and eventually into owner-cultivators—a phenomenon known as "wealth does not endure beyond three generations." These two processes operated simultaneously, resulting in roughly comparable levels of land concentration during the early, middle, and late Qing periods.  

### Environmental Degradation and Mismanagement of Resources?  
The book *Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed* presents numerous cases of societal decline caused by environmental degradation and misresource management. For example, Easter Island's inhabitants overexploited forests, leading to ecological collapse and eventual societal decline; residents of Pitcairn and Henderson Islands struggled to sustain development due to improper resource use; the Anasazi civilization collapsed amid environmental deterioration and resource competition; the Maya civilization declined due to overexploitation of land and water resources compounded by political corruption; and a comparison of the Dominican Republic and Haiti illustrates how differing policies and resource management yield divergent developmental outcomes. The author enumerates many instances where environmental degradation and resource mismanagement preceded societal collapse. However, these patterns appear more as byproducts of the collapse process rather than its root cause.  

### Institutional Factors?  
*Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty* offers an institutional perspective. It advances the "ineffectual theory," refuting traditional explanations of national poverty rooted in geography, culture, or policy ignorance, and posits that institutions are the decisive factor. It distinguishes between inclusive and extractive institutions, arguing that prosperity and poverty stem from institutional incentives, with politics determining institutional form. The core thesis is that national rise and fall depend on political and economic institutions: inclusive institutions, which safeguard citizen rights, encourage innovation, and foster fair competition, underpin national prosperity; extractive institutions, which concentrate power and wealth among a minority, breed corruption, waste resources, and stifle economic growth. While institutions are indeed critical to a nation’s success or failure—as analyzed in the previous chapter—the design intent, implementation efficacy, and evolutionary direction of institutions ultimately depend on human agency. Often, identical institutions yield vastly different outcomes among different groups or even within the same group across time. For instance, the *Tang Code* (Commentaries on the Tang Code) was an advanced legal codification in its era. Yet the political clarity, virtuous governance, and flourishing power of early Tang, which attracted tributes from all nations, could not be replicated in late Tang despite adherence to similar institutional frameworks. The book opens with a comparison of Nogales, Arizona (U.S.) and Nogales, Sonora (Mexico), demonstrating divergent development under similar geographic and cultural conditions due to differing institutions. However, beyond institutional design, the basic quality of the populace also plays a role—explaining why Western institutions do not yield uniform results globally. Dogmatic institutionalism, particularly the belief in "institutional omnipotence," cannot halt the *Law of Historical Cycles*.  

### The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns  
*The Collapse of Complex Societies* innovatively introduces an economic concept into sociology: the *Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns*. The book illustrates this with examples from the Roman, Maya, and Chaco civilizations.  

- **Roman Civilization**: In its early stages, the Roman Empire’s efficient administrative hierarchy and transportation network boosted trade and resource allocation, with increasing societal complexity yielding significant marginal gains. However, by the later period, maintaining its massive bureaucracy became prohibitively costly. Expanding the military and upgrading military technology faced diminishing marginal returns amid stagnant frontier defense and expansion. War-related losses and military expenditures plunged the economy into crisis. Overreliance on slave labor further destabilized the economic structure, leaving the empire ill-equipped to bear costs or allocate resources when confronted with external shocks like Germanic invasions, ultimately leading to collapse.  

- **Maya Civilization**: During the Classic Period, the Maya expanded terrace farming and invested labor in irrigation to meet growing food demands. However, intensive cultivation depleted soil fertility, reducing per-unit agricultural output and driving persistent diminishing marginal returns. Meanwhile, significant resources were diverted to religious and cultural projects rather than enhancing material productivity. When droughts struck, the civilization lacked the resources to mitigate crises, exacerbating social tensions and triggering decline.  

- **Chaco Civilization**: Early Chaco saw clear marginal gains from expanded trade and organizational complexity. However, as surrounding resources were exhausted and competition intensified, expanding trade networks escalated costs. Large-scale public construction and trade activities concentrated resources excessively, deepening social stratification and wealth disparity. The elite’s resource hoarding and extravagance failed to generate sufficient economic returns for society. Under the pressure of diminishing marginal returns, social unrest and population migration ensued, leading to the abandonment of the civilization’s core regions.  

[In fact, the "Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns" can be generalized across all dimensions of life’s cooperative endeavors. This manifests as the nonlinear escalation of *Cooperation Maintenance Costs*: as cooperative scale increases, marginal returns diminish unless emergent capabilities arise. This is why many life forms struggle to surpass a certain threshold in cooperative scale (e.g., organism size) prior to dimensional ascension.]  

While this theory explains why expanding societies may collapse, it fails to account for collapses in non-expanding or shrinking societies.  

### More Underlying Causes?  
Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty offered a comprehensive summary of the causes of dynastic fall: "A nation perishes due to powerful regional vassals, foreign invasions, overmighty ministers, imperial consorts’ kin, imperial concubines, eunuchs, treacherous officials, and sycophants." These factors, however, are more like triggers. Why do such "treacherous" elements rarely emerge at a dynasty’s inception?  

Regarding China’s dynastic cycles, Japanese scholar Naitō Konan (1866–1934) proposed the "poisoning-detoxification theory." Setting aside its later distortion by militarism, this theory astutely observes how Chinese civilization underwent renewal through foreign incursions. Yet it applies more accurately to European civilizations—Greek-Roman-Germanic-British-American—where later, more "civilized" powers, though not conquering by force, economically dominated Europe, functioning as "edge-nations" that "detoxified" core civilizations. In contrast, China often achieves renewal through internal revolutions. However, this theory merely describes surface phenomena without probing deeper mechanisms.  

Beyond these superficial causes, is there a more fundamental, unifying reason driving historical cycles? To explain this, three key questions demand answers:  

[1. Why do Central Plains empires, despite demographic advantages and favorable geography, peak and decline?  
2. Why can smaller, less civilized, and less technologically advanced "barbarian" groups defeat far larger Central Plains empires?  
3. Why does each new dynasty, established after the collapse of the old, fail to achieve substantive progress, leading to another cycle of collapse within centuries?]
