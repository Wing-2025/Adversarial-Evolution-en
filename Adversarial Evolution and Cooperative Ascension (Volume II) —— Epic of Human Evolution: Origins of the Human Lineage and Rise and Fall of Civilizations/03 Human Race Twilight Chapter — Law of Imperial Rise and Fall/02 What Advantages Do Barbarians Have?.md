# What Advantages Do Barbarian Tribes Possess? Why Do Vast Empires Ultimately Decline?  
Let us consider this question from the perspective of barbarian tribes—given that massive Central Plains empires are often eventually conquered by small barbarian tribes, what advantages do these tribes hold over the Central Plains empires? And what disadvantages do the Central Plains empires have relative to the barbarians? How is it that two clusters so vastly different in apparent strength and numerical power end up with such unexpected outcomes? To clarify this, we must first examine the political systems, moral traditions, and levels of civilization of these "barbarian tribes."  

### The Politics of Barbarian Tribes  
At the height of Temüjin's military power, his sons and noble ministers each operated independently. Temüjin's title "Genghis Khan" was bestowed upon him by the leaders and nobles of the Mongol tribes through the Kurultai (a council system for deliberation among tribes or tribal confederations). In the early 13th century, the Italian missionary Giovanni da Pian del Carpine recorded in *History of the Mongols* a regulation purportedly from Genghis Khan: "If any person, out of arrogance, presumes to claim the title of Emperor without the selection of the princes, he shall be executed without mercy." Those familiar with Roman history may recall "Valerius the People's Friend" from the Roman Kingdom period, who enacted a law stating: "Whoever covets the throne, regardless of identity, shall forfeit his life and property to the gods." This meant that those who killed throne-seekers would be pardoned. Valerius the People's Friend was, in fact, the founder of Rome's republican system.  

The "Eight Banners" system, the military foundation of the Qing dynasty and deemed "the cornerstone of the state," similarly bears the legacy of tribal traditions. As Meng Sen noted in *Lectures on Qing History*: "The Eight Banners constituted the state structure established by Emperor Taizu. The entire nation was subordinated to the Eight Banners, with eight *hosho beile* (nobles) as banner lords. Those under a banner were called *shuren* (dependents), and a dependent owed a lord the loyalty of a subject to a sovereign. The eight *beile* governed the state collectively, with no fixed monarch; they publicly elected a leader from among the eight, and if the eight disagreed, they could replace him. This was the constitutional principle orally established by Taizu. If we must name this system, it could be called a federal system, though in essence, it was a 'banner confederation.'"  

From this, we observe that the governance of barbarian tribes often resembles a republican system of collegial rule by nobles. Tribal traditions even gave rise to peculiar customs incomprehensible to the Han people. For example, the *Book of Zhou: Biography of the Turks* records a bizarre Turkic tradition: when noble ministers enthroned a khan, they first lifted him on a felt rug and circled the sun nine times. Then, they placed him on a horse and strangled his neck with silk until he neared death, after which they released him and asked, "How many years will you rule as khan?" Dazed from the spinning and strangling, the khan would blurt out a number, which his subordinates then used to validate his reign's duration. Superficially, this custom seems猎奇 (eccentric) and contradicts our understanding of monarchs: how could a sovereign be nearly killed by his ministers? Yet it was undeniably real.  

The Arab Istakhri recorded a similar investiture ceremony for the Khazar khan: "When they appoint a khan, they strangle him with silk until he is nearly unconscious, then ask, 'How long do you wish to rule?' He names a number of years. If he dies before that term, it is an auspicious sign; if the term expires, they kill him." This aligns with Chinese historical records. This peculiar custom reflects barbarian tribal traditions: their leaders were established through the support of noble ministers, who also possessed the authority and power to constrain monarchical power.  

According to the Arab historian Ibn Fadlan: "Their khans rule for forty years. If a ruler exceeds this term by even a day, his people and ministers execute him, claiming his reason has been lost and his intellect has grown muddled." The Turkic custom can be seen as a primitive version of "term limits for heads of state."  

The Arab historian Al-Masudi wrote: "When the Khazars face famine or other disasters, unfavorable war prospects, or a declaration of enmity by another people, or any misfortune, the people and nobles rush to the monarch, saying, 'This khan’s rule only portends disaster; it is not auspicious for us. Execute him, or hand him over to us to kill.' The monarch sometimes allows himself to be killed, sometimes commits suicide, and sometimes pleads for mercy, claiming he has not committed any crime worthy of punishment."  

Tacitus, in *Germania*, described the tribal traditions of the Germanic peoples (then considered barbarians): "Among the Germans, minor matters are discussed by the chieftains; major matters are decided by the entire tribe. Though the people hold the final decision-making power, affairs are first deliberated by the chieftains. [...] When a sufficient number have gathered, the assembly begins, with all seated armed. Priests proclaim silence, as they have the authority to maintain order. Then, among the kings or chieftains—selected by age, birth, renown in war, or oratory—one steps forward to speak. The people listen, not because he commands, but because he persuades. If his proposal is unsatisfactory, they respond with disdainful hisses; if approved, they clatter their spears: this demonstration with weapons is the most respectful form of agreement.  

"Their kings are chosen by birth, while generals are selected for their valor. A king’s power is not absolute; he cannot act arbitrarily. Generals do not command soldiers through orders but lead by example, winning their loyalty through bravery in battle and charging at the front. However, matters such as execution, imprisonment, and even flogging are solely the domain of the priests, for they are not viewed as punishments or military orders but as sacred decrees. Their battle formations are not haphazardly arranged but organized by family and blood ties, which is a key source of their courage: beside each man stand his dearest kin, and they can hear the wails of women and children. These are the most cherished onlookers in every man’s heart, the ones whose praise he eagerly seeks. They bear their wounds to their mothers and wives, who fearlessly inspect and count them; these women manage the warriors’ food, drink, and encouragement."

### The Morality of Barbarian Tribes  
Duke Mu of Qin rose to hegemony primarily through conquering the Western Rong tribes, "gaining twelve vassal states and expanding his territory by a thousand li," thus dominating the West. Yet at the time, the State of Qin held no advantage over the Rong tribes. The Rong king sent a minister named You Yu to Qin. You Yu’s ancestors were from the Jin state, having fled to Rong territory from Huaxia (the Central Plains). Fluent in both Rong and Jin dialects, You Yu possessed cultural perspectives from both Huaxia and barbarian worlds.  

During his visit, Duke Mu displayed Qin’s palaces and treasures. Since Huaxia states levied taxes more effectively than barbarian tribes, Duke Mu sought to impress You Yu with this wealth. To his surprise, You Yu scorned the opulence: "Even the gods would tire from constructing and accumulating such palaces and treasures. If common people are made to do so, they will be utterly exhausted." You Yu, hailing from the Rong tribes, exhibited greater benevolence.  

Duke Mu then boasted of Huaxia’s spiritual civilization: "We in Huaxia have poetry, history, rites, music, and laws to govern affairs, yet we still face turmoil. You Rong have none of these—how do you govern? Must it not be extremely difficult?"  

You Yu’s response was striking: These very poetry, history, rites, music, and laws are the roots of Huaxia’s turmoil. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor created rites, music, and legal codes and led by example, achieving minor peace. But later rulers grew increasingly decadent, using elaborate laws to oppress, demand, and monitor the people. Exhausted, the people resented their rulers and demanded benevolence. Mutual resentment led to usurpation, slaughter, and even the extermination of clans. In the Yellow Emperor’s era, rulers themselves abided by the rites and laws, enabling peace. But later, this reciprocal relationship was broken: rulers became despotic Grabbers, using rites and laws to unilaterally rule their subjects, who in turn became slaves and potential rebels.  

You Yu continued: The Rong tribes differ from Huaxia states. Those in power treat their subjects with profound benevolence; subjects serve their rulers with unwavering loyalty. [The governance of the entire state is as natural as one controlling one’s own body, requiring no elaborate methods—this is true sage governance.]()  

The Western context is similar. For instance, according to traditional Western historians, the fall of the Roman Empire to the Germanic tribes was not a tragedy of "barbarism defeating civilization." Instead, compared to the decrepit Roman Empire, the young, valorous, and freedom-loving Germanic tribes were closer to the essence of civilization. Edward Gibbon, for example, argued that by the late Roman Empire, the people had been spiritually diminished; it was the invasion of valorous, freedom-seeking barbarians that "revived their manly spirit of freedom." David Hume viewed the late Romans as an "enervated race."

Even Roman historians could acknowledge the virtues of the "barbarians." In *Agricola* by Tacitus, he records the words of British barbarians: "We fight for our homeland, our wives, and our parents; the Romans fight only for greed and licentiousness. If we but summon the courage of our ancestors, the Romans will flee, just as the dead Julius fled." Thus, mirroring Confucius’s notion that "when rituals are lost, seek them among the uncivilized," Tacitus turned his gaze to the youthful Germanic barbarians, noting their "innate simplicity, untainted by cunning or deceit"; their pursuit of freedom, "unburdened by tribute or the oppression of tax-farmers"; and their valor: "Among warriors, it is a shame for a chieftain to be less brave than his men, and a shame for retainers to be less brave than their chieftain." Centuries before the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Tacitus had already lucidly identified the causes of Rome’s decline.  

[We can clearly observe that the morality of these "barbarians" preserved more of the primal essence of human evolution—sincerity, accountability, meritocracy, unity between leaders and followers, and collective shame in failing to contribute. Embedded in these customs and traditions was a more efficient cooperative model, drastically enhancing group competitiveness.]  

### Who Is More Civilized?  
If we compare technological advancement, artistic achievement, cultural depth, or hygienic standards, the barbarians were no match for the Central Plains peoples. [These, however, are not the core of civilization. The true measure of civilization lies in high-dimensional cooperative instincts—instincts that enable a seemingly weak, "less civilized" collective to outperform others.] This is precisely where the decadent Central Plains peoples lagged behind the "barbarians."  

This observation was not new. The Jin scholar Fu Yi noted: ["The Qiang and Hu, being foreign peoples, reside in Central China and share weal and woe. The people of the Central Plains, however, are divided in heart, which is why the 'barbarians' are fewer but stronger, while the Han are more numerous yet weaker."] In other words, the Central Plains peoples lacked the unity and mutual aid of northern "barbarians," making them weaker. *Zizhi Tongjian* also remarks on the Uyghurs’ simple customs: "The distinctions between ruler and subject are not extreme, so their wills are unified, and they are valiant and invincible."  

This disparity did not emerge overnight. At the founding of an empire, cooperative levels were relatively high. Over time, however, cooperative capacity eroded. Some Central Plains scholars even longed to "infuse the decadent body of Central Plains culture with the vigorous blood of the wilds beyond the frontier, purging old vices, reviving new vitality, and expanding to create unprecedented eras."  

During the period of "Five Barbarians Invading the Central Plains," many barbarian leaders—including Liu Yuan of the Xiongnu, Shi Le of the Jie, Fu Jian of the Di, and Murong Ke/Murong Chui of the Xianbei—unified northern China. Compared to legitimate Jin emperors, these leaders more closely embodied the ideals of wise rulers; Fu Jian, Murong Ke, and Murong Chui even displayed rare idealism, unseen since the Three Dynasties. In fact, they were deeply sinicized, often better representing traditional Central Plains culture.  

In contrast, the Western and Eastern Jin courts were rife with corruption: infighting, power struggles, and scheming outweighed efforts to save the nation. While some barbarians—like Shi Hu—embraced "jungle law," killing without mercy or even taking pleasure in torturing their sons, [such overt Grabbingism was unpopular and swiftly overthrown. Its harm paled beside the insidious Hypocrisyism that festered beneath a veneer of decency. Overt grabbing is visible to commoners and quickly met with resistance; hidden grabbing, however, clings like a festering sore, often incurable until the system is terminally ill.]  

### Group Competition Breeds Higher Cooperative Groups  
Why were barbarian politics and morality often more advanced? This is the result of Group Competition. [As discussed repeatedly in the previous volume, competition between groups (the "individuals" of the next dimension) shapes the cooperative degree of these "individuals"—a point we need not reiterate here.]  

Scholarly focus on human societies as cohesive units is growing. For example, *Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall* introduces the "meta-ethnic frontier" theory. Drawing on Ibn Khaldun and others, it argues that external threats or competition strengthen internal unity. In meta-ethnic frontiers, natural competition or latent conflict between groups fosters tighter cohesion to safeguard interests and identity. The theory uses data to show that frequent population movement enhances cultural diffusion; moderate resource competition strengthens group cohesion under certain conditions, while excessive competition may fragment groups—thus precisely modeling the dynamic between meta-ethnic frontier environments and group unity.  

During the Period of Five Barbarians and Sixteen States, followed by the Northern and Southern Dynasties and the Sui-Tang power struggles, [China entered a classic era of Group Competition.] In this turbulent period, the survival of competing groups—from leaders, generals, and advisors to their followers—depended on their collective quality. After multiple rounds of competition involving dozens of regimes, we see a clear improvement in the caliber of rulers during the Sui-Tang struggles compared to earlier periods.  

This process of Group Competition ultimately led to Li Shimin, of Xianbei descent, securing victory and founding a new golden age of Chinese civilization. Similar patterns have repeated: Chai Rong, ruler of the Later Zhou, laid the groundwork to end the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period through military campaigns; he was a rare emperor of lofty ambition, diligence, and openness to counsel. Zhao Kuangyin, a Later Zhou general, later unified the realm to establish the Northern Song. Similarly, Yelu Abaoji first unified the Khitan tribes through intra-tribal competition, then conquered the Xi and Shiwei to found the Liao Dynasty. Genghis Khan unified the Mongol tribes through smaller-scale group competition before unifying the world. Nurhaci similarly unified the Jurchen tribes prior to expanding his dominion.  

Europe’s significant role in human civilization owes much to its prolonged period of Group Competition—a topic to be explored in the subsequent section, "Adversarial Evolutionary Geography." The Central Plains dynasties resembled aging corporations in decline, while border barbarians were like thriving startups. Superficially, the "corporation" had size, talent, cultural prosperity, technological progress, developed systems, and deep heritage. The "startup" seemed to challenge it like an ant against a tree. Yet the corporation was rotten: corrupt, factional, alienated, rife with infighting, purges, and embezzlement. Even loyal and capable individuals faced exclusion, oppression, or persecution. The startup, however, was unified: meritocratic, sharp, pragmatic, and enterprising. These barbarians may not have been exceptionally benevolent or mutually supportive—they simply lacked the scheming, frame-ups, and duplicity of the Central Plains. Yet this alone enabled them to defeat the vast, decadent Central Plains empires. Though it may seem as if a trivial ant were toppling a giant tree, this outcome is far from inconceivable when viewed beneath the surface.
