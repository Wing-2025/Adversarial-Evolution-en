# Adversarial Evolution Geography  

We have previously discussed the evolutionary principles underlying the rise and fall of empires. However, when we examine world history, it seems that only the history of Chinese civilization exemplifies this typical cycle of rise and decline. The Roman Empire did face invasions by barbarian tribes, but in subsequent history, such instances of barbarian invasions replacing "Central Plains" dynasties became rare, and cases of peasant uprisings directly overthrowing governments were even more extremely uncommon. Does this not contradict the aforementioned evolutionary principles of imperial rise and fall? This is the topic that requires further discussion in this section.  

Upon a thorough understanding of the evolutionary principles outlined above, we recognize several prerequisites: these principles pertain to the rise and fall of a dominant empire within a relatively enclosed region. The key lies in the fact that a dominant empire, having lost the evolutionary environment of group competition and the external pressures of inter-group rivalry, becomes more prone to losing its internal "Virtue Selection" mechanisms, leading to deeper internal corruption through grabbing behaviors.  

If we delve further, why did East Asian empires evolve into a single dominant civilization, while Western European states have long maintained a multi-civilizational state of inter-group competition? Just as humans, the most cooperative species, originated on the East African savanna; just as orcas and dolphins, highly intelligent and social species, evolved in the oceans; and just as early human civilizations emerged in river valleys—these patterns reveal that the trajectory of Adversarial Evolution is deeply and profoundly connected to geographical environments. The characteristics of regional geography have exerted far-reaching and unforeseen influences on the evolutionary trends of human societies in those regions.  

## Unveiling the Secrets of Imperial Rise and Fall Through Cross-Dimensional Analogy  

At first glance, the causes of imperial rise and fall appear highly complex, involving numerous factors such as population, economy, culture, climate, internal strife, and external threats. However, these factors rarely completely destroy a nation. A resilient people, like the tenacious grass on the plain, cannot be eradicated by wildfires; they regrow with the spring breeze. [The truly fatal threat stems from internal cancerization, which plunges the nation into a severe process of Reverse Selection. Once large-scale cancerization through Reverse Selection takes hold, the nation is nearly beyond redemption.]() This is strikingly similar to three-dimensional life forms: while cancerization may not be the most direct or overt cause of death, it is often the ultimate cause of demise for all three-dimensional organisms.  

Of course, we must understand that aging is a mild, generalized form of cancerization. Aging, in essence, is a process where cells gradually become selfish, increasingly inclined toward grabbing behaviors, and progressively lose their initial intensity and capacity for cooperation during continuous replication. Cancerization most directly triggers a process of Dimensional Collapse. A group undergoing Dimensional Collapse rapidly loses the cooperative dividends gained from dimensional ascension, thereby becoming fragile and weak. Such a life form in the throes of dimensional degradation can be defeated by either internal uprisings or external powerful groups.  

Moreover, the random mutations inherent in genetic replication render cancerization an inevitable process. For three-dimensional life forms, regions with more frequent cellular turnover face a higher probability of cancerization; thus, inflamed areas are more prone to cancerization than other regions. The same applies to four-dimensional life forms: among royal families with numerous concubines and offspring, the probability of cancerization is also remarkably high.  

To prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of cancerization, three-dimensional life forms have evolved various anti-cancer (and thus anti-aging) mechanisms, including the preservation of germ cells, telomere mechanisms, and immune (i.e., three-dimensional life's Virtue Selection) mechanisms. Similarly, four-dimensional life forms have developed analogous mechanisms, such as moral and legal Virtue Selection systems. However, the anti-cancer systems of four-dimensional life forms are far from mature; they have not even fully recognized the issue of four-dimensional life cancerization, just as three-dimensional life forms only began to grasp the horror of cancer in the past two centuries. [Therefore, the rise and fall of empires are fundamentally akin to the rise and fall of individuals—both stem from decline caused by cancerization, a loss of generalized group cooperation, a surge in grabbing deficits, a significant reduction in the life form's adaptability, and eventual collapse under the pressure of external triggers.]()  

## The Geographical Context of Chinese Civilization—Unipolar Population Aggregation Structure  

Let us first examine the geographical profile of Chinese civilization. For Chinese civilization, to the north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River lies vast grassland; to the south, dense primeval forests that are difficult to cultivate; to the east, the sea, with few offshore islands; and to the west, plateaus unsuitable for farming. Only the Central Plains region, centered roughly on Shangqiu, Henan, is relatively flat, suitable for irrigation and agriculture. This area, surrounded by two rivers, is fertile and ideal for farming. Its geographical features—an expanse of flat land bordered by hills and plateaus, and further enclosed by deserts with sparse human activity—have led Jared Diamond to aptly compare China's geography to "a walled courtyard." This has given rise to a distinctive characteristic of the Chinese nation—[Unipolar Population Aggregation Structure]().  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d68da086-c65f-461d-b233-0eb47aeff224" />  
</p>  

For agrarian civilizations, the core areas of development are river-irrigated plains. This pattern holds true for the earliest human civilizations, including the Sumerian civilization in the Tigris-Euphrates Valley, the ancient Egyptian civilization in the Nile Valley, and the Chinese civilization in the Yellow River Valley. While such irrigated civilizations tend to mature earlier and enter the civilized stage more rapidly, their concentrated resources, growing population density, and generally flat geographical environments intensify conflicts and competition among human tribes.  

The unipolar population center structure of the Chinese nation dictates that "he who controls the Central Plains rules the world." Confronted with this reality, various tribes have sought a common sovereign to maintain order. Without such a figure, mutual slaughter and competition would lead to a lose-lose outcome. Thus, for this civilization, unification is an inherent evolutionary requirement.  

The *Records of the Yellow Emperor* is a concise text detailing how the Yellow Emperor unified the world. Sima Qian noted that since Shennong invented agriculture, people emerged from barbarism. However, with no common sovereign, "feudal lords attacked one another" and "oppressed the people." Tribes warred constantly, plunging the world into chaos and leaving the people in constant suffering. At this juncture, the Yellow Emperor arose. Leading his tribe, he first conquered the Yan Emperor's tribe, forming the Yan-Huang tribal alliance, and began to subdue other recalcitrant tribes. The most significant battle occurred between the Yan-Huang alliance and the Jiuli tribe of the south. Legend has it that this brutal war was vast and惨烈, resulting in "blood flowing for a hundred li" and "blood-soaked pestles floating," ultimately leaving "no survivors in the nine regions"—meaning the enemy was nearly annihilated.  

These are not mere legends. Sima Qian's accounts have been partially corroborated by archaeology. Discoveries indicate that during the late primitive society before the Xia Dynasty, numerous wars occurred across China. This period's tombs reveal a large number of headless graves (bodies without heads), head-only graves (heads without bodies), dismembered graves (heads and bodies separated), and corpses with sword and arrow wounds. Additionally, many defensive city sites first appeared in China during this period. Thus, the legend of the Yellow Emperor may represent the brutal warring stage China underwent before the formal formation of the state. The *Records of the Grand Historian* portrays the Yellow Emperor's life as one of constant battle and conquest. Whenever he heard of a tribe refusing to submit, he led his forces to suppress it, pacifying the region before moving on. He "cut through mountains and opened roads, never resting," engaging in "fifty-two battles to subdue the world."  

Ancient people also possessed profound insights into the influence of geographical factors. When King Fuchai of Wu intended to attack Qi, Wu Zixu advised: "This is unwise. Qi and Wu differ in customs and languages; even if we take Qi's land, we cannot settle there, and even if we take Qi's people, we cannot command them. Wu and Yue, however, share borders, connected by roads, with shared customs and languages. If we take Yue's land, we can settle there; if we take Yue's people, we can command them. The same applies to Yue regarding Wu. Wu and Yue cannot coexist. Yue is like a心腹 ailment to Wu—though it may not act immediately, its harm is deep and internal. Qi, however, is merely a skin irritation to Wu—easily treated and harmless." Wu Zixu's point was clear: adjacent kingdoms on flat land could not coexist.  

## The Geographical Context of Western European Civilization—Multipolar Population Aggregation Structure

Let us now turn our attention to the geographical conditions around ancient Greece, the cradle of European civilization. Greece is situated on the Balkan Peninsula, where the western part is dominated by the Dinaric-Pindus Mountains, the central-eastern region by the Balkan Mountains, and the area between these two mountain ranges by the ancient Rhodope Mountains and Macedonian massif. The peninsula features scattered plains, with only the valleys of the Sava, Danube, and Maritsa rivers being relatively broad. The prevalence of mountainous terrain prevents any single power from achieving dominance, making it highly conducive to fragmentation.  

Similarly, Italy, another cradle of European civilization, shares analogous characteristics. The Alps lie to the north of Italy, serving as a natural barrier, while the Apennine Mountains run along the eastern part of the peninsula, stretching from north to south and nearly bisecting Italy. Italy is bordered by the sea on its eastern, western, and southern sides. [Looking across the European landscape, the central regions are fragmented by hills and mountains, with the Mediterranean Sea lying below, allowing ships to traverse between peninsulas.]  

Unlike the Chinese civilization, conflicts between ancient Greek tribes, though frequent, were generally small-scale and never escalated into the massive unification wars seen in China. While occasional wars did occur, peace prevailed for most periods. This is because Greece’s terrain is not flat but mountainous—launching a campaign against another tribe required scaling numerous mountains, which was arduous. If a tribe resolved to flee, its extensive coastline led to a chain of islands. With no food, they could sail out to trade or establish colonies, making it nearly impossible to completely eradicate a people.  

In such a geographical context, even wars were less brutal than those in China. Ancient Chinese wars were existential—defeat meant annihilation, rendering them more intense and prolonged than those in many other regions. In China’s enclosed environment, with no retreat but into uninhabitable mountains or deserts, survival depended on the total elimination of the enemy. In Europe, however, fleeing overseas provided a viable refuge during national crises. During the Second Greco-Persian War, for instance, two-thirds of Greek territory had fallen to Persia, and Sparta, the preeminent land power, had been defeated. Themistocles of Athens countered by abandoning the city of Athens, relocating all citizens to Salamis Island, and leveraging naval superiority to lure the numerically dominant Persian forces into a naval battle—a domain where they were unskilled—ultimately securing victory.  

The hilly terrain also made it easier for European peoples to find defensible settlements. Rome, for example, is known as the "City of Seven Hills." Had Rome not been situated atop these seven hills, it would have been annihilated by the Celtic invasions in the pre-Christian era, and the Roman people would never have gone on to "rule the world."  

As Gu Zhun noted: "Greek civilization was shaped, to a certain extent, by geographical factors. The defining feature of a maritime civilization is the ease of mobility—dissidents could flee by sea, preventing autocrats from eliminating them. Hence, the notion of 'the sea as an escape route' pervades Greek civilization." The same logic applies to Rome: they rarely executed individuals, preferring exile instead—for if you sought to execute someone, they could easily flee (as seen in the cases of Hannibal and Caesar), making capture difficult. This fostered a higher degree of political tolerance in Greek and Roman civilizations. [Europe’s geographical environment determined the tolerance and longevity of adversarial evolution among its multiple peoples, playing a pivotal role in shaping European identity. This multipolar population aggregation structure in Europe sustained long-term competitive relations among groups. Crucially, this competition did not devolve into short-sighted, mortal combat.] [Such dynamics were particularly conducive to enhancing intra-ethnic cooperation and cohesion. This is also a key reason why most modern civilizational achievements were realized among Western European peoples.]

In contrast to Europe’s multipolar population aggregation structure, the geographical uniqueness of China’s Central Plains gave rise to a unipolar population aggregation structure, making it difficult to sustain a multi-ethnic, multi-state system. Consequently, unified dynasties have been established in the Central Plains since at least the Shang Dynasty. This led to a relatively moderate period of group competition during the Western Zhou Dynasty. As population growth accelerated, previously isolated groups increasingly clashed over territorial issues, eventually erupting into relentless, life-or-death wars among states. [Peoples forged in such an environment were inevitably short-sighted. The State of Qin, for example, could mobilize ten times the proportion of troops as Rome, and the brutality and cunning of its tactics surpassed anything seen in Western warfare. I believe that if early Western and Eastern civilizations had clashed directly, the West would have been hard-pressed to match the East. However, Western civilization, shielded by its hilly and insular terrain, survived its vulnerable early stages, eventually developing the long-term advantages of commercial civilization, stronger group cooperation, and social ethics.] [China’s courtyard-style topographical landscape is profoundly tragic. Like crickets confined in a clay pot, these groups had no retreat—only forward movement. Their relations were chaotic: feigned cooperation, sneak attacks, and mobbing. Perpetually in peril, they could neither form lasting friendships nor formulate long-term policies. Only Legalism, a tool for maximizing short-term gains, enabled one group to survive this brutal struggle for existence. Yet even this could not counteract the self-destructive effects of overusing such "stimulants," ensuring its eventual downfall. Perhaps this is the earliest origin of China’s "involutionary genes."]  

### Unity: The Only Path for the Chinese People  
Though Europe saw constant warfare during the Roman era, the proportion of troops to population remained small. In the pivotal Battle of Alesia, which Caesar won to subdue Gaul, only 50,000 soldiers were involved. Due to Europe’s geography, the Romans displayed extraordinary tolerance—secure behind natural defenses, they could afford to be lenient toward defeated enemies, unafraid of reprisals. These "warfare buffers" subtly shaped ethnic character. Romans respected their adversaries, admired strength, and sought to learn from formidable opponents, rather than being blinded by hatred. The key reason was that foreign peoples could not easily annihilate them.  

In contrast, China’s enclosed, fertile plains supported rapid population growth, leaving little room for expansion. By the late Spring and Autumn period, territorial conflicts escalated, becoming irreconcilable by the Warring States period. The trauma of relentless, no-retreat warfare left an indelible mark on the Chinese psyche, instilling a deep fear of strife and chaos. The graph below illustrates the drastic population declines caused by dynastic transitions in China. Each transition brought profound suffering to the people. While Europe also experienced wars, its population fluctuations remained relatively stable. Thus, after the Qin and Han dynasties, the Chinese people have consistently sought unity. The adage "Better to be a peaceful dog than a person in chaos" has become deeply ingrained.

### A Dominant Empire Is Prone to Decay: The Larger the Body, the Deeper the Malady  
Superficially, unity seems beneficial, but from the perspective of adversarial evolution, fortune and misfortune are intertwined, and the future is uncertain. As previously discussed, a unified empire with minimal external group competition harbors numerous catalysts for decay. Its sheer size prolongs the process of corruption, and even if defeated by smaller groups, its "blood" cannot be fully renewed. This makes it difficult for new Chinese empires to escape backward systems of autocracy, weakening of the people, and systemic deception, perpetuating historical cycles. Mechanistically, a dominant empire is all but destined to decay.  

In the era of small, fragmented states, the process of group selection was not protracted. With comparable sizes, a corrupt, less cooperative state could be encroached upon or replaced by others (though high-cooperation groups might not triumph immediately due to group grabbingism, this trend was nearly inevitable in the long term). In the presence of group competition, autocracy was often unsustainable. For example, Spain and France both had highly autocratic rulers, but as state power dwindled, popular cooperation declined, and group competitiveness weakened, these regimes were either overthrown or forced to adopt more cooperative, productive models. Thus, large-scale hypocrisy and grabbingism could not persist indefinitely.

Yet, an empire dominated by a single power actually leaves considerable time and space for such internal grabbing evolution. Generally, from the onset of corruption to its ultimate decline, there spans several hundred years, during which the genes of Hypocrisyism and grabbing propagate extensively downward from the ruling class. [From another perspective, we observe that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods—an era of fragmented small states and prevalent group competition—China witnessed the intellectual flourishing of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Over the subsequent two millennia of unified imperial history, however, Chinese thought has largely subsisted on the scraps of this intellectual feast, or even regressed—many forward-thinking concepts have been suppressed and distorted.]()[The role of the Group Competition Selection Mechanism is thus evident. It was precisely under the condition of sustaining group competition that European nations achieved pivotal human advancements such as the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution.]() People often revere emperors who expanded territories and unified the Central Plains, such as Qin Shi Huang and Han Wudi. In reality, however, China’s unification and expansion were nearly inevitable, determined by its geographical environment—an outcome that required no haste. Had it not been Qin Shi Huang or Han Wudi, others would have fulfilled this mission. Yet their warlike pursuits, capricious use of favor and coercion, and monopolization of imperial power instead laid the groundwork for the intellectual stagnation of China’s feudal dynasties and the universal flattery toward imperial authority. Conversely, those they insolently demeaned—such as Han Fei, and above all, Grand Historian Sima Qian, who endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens to "explore the relationship between heaven and man, and understand the transformations of past and present"—truly laid the foundation for humanity’s enduring legacy. Without Records of the Grand Historian, the source of official historiography, many subsequent historical texts might never have existed, and we would lack the basis to discern the profound laws of human evolution.
