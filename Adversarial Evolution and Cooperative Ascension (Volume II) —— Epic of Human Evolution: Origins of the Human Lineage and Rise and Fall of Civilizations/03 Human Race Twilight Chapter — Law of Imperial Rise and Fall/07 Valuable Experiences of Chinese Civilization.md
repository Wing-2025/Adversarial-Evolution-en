# Valuable Experiences of Chinese Civilization

## Eternal Nobility: The Possibly Longest-Surviving Known Human Civilization

### The Mystery of the Decline of Ancient Civilizations
Multiple civilizations in Mesopotamia, including Sumer and Babylon, the Ancient Egyptian civilization, and the Mayan civilization once achieved remarkable cultural accomplishments. They all almost established centralized symbols such as the Hanging Gardens, Egyptian pyramids, and Mayan pyramids. In terms of astronomy, calendar systems, technology, and mathematics, they made achievements that later generations consider far beyond their times. However, after these civilizations declined, the level of human civilization in those regions seemed to regress. People have put forward numerous speculations about the decline of these civilizations, especially regarding the fall of Sumer and the Maya, often resorting to fantastical ideas. Theories include catastrophic events, foreign invasions, and even extraterrestrial influences to justify their collapse. 

[Fundamentally, this stems from a long-standing fixed mindset—that the development of civilization is linear, that it must progress from lower to higher levels, and that higher-level civilizations will inevitably defeat lower-level ones; lower-level civilizations will continuously develop toward higher levels over time, and higher-level civilizations will not regress.]() In reality, this is merely wishful thinking. [What is particularly erroneous is the subconscious assumption that science, technology, and productivity are the most important indicators for evaluating the level of civilization. This mistake is analogous to regarding intelligence as the most important indicator for evaluating individual capability.]() It seems as if civilizations with higher science and technology will necessarily defeat those with lower levels. Within the framework of Adversarial Evolution, we can deduce entirely different conclusions—[civilizations will flourish and then decline, and advanced civilizations may collapse due to internal strife or be defeated by less advanced ones because of insufficient or depleted Group Cooperation Degree.]() The history of the rise and fall of states during the Two Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties in China particularly reflects such historical laws. A state's prosperity did not depend on its strength, but on the extent of internal strife; on the number of schemers and ambitious individuals within; and on the number of people who excelled in internal struggles but were incompetent externally. In fact, [the more advanced, superior, and less group-competitive a civilization is, the more prone it is to falling into the traps of individual grabbing, corruption, cancerization, and decline. If a civilization dominates without rivals, its decline will be more thorough than that of civilizations with competitors, eventually forming an irreversible process.]() 

Specifically, we can boldly hypothesize the reasons for the disappearance of these "advanced civilizations" from the earth: When their autocratic centralization reached its peak, the ruling class began to undergo cancerization. Grabbing genes spread from the ruling class downward, with deception and exploitation becoming widespread. Reverse Selection occurred continuously. Meanwhile, if such a civilization was the most powerful group in a relatively closed region, lacking the Group Competition Selection Mechanism to eliminate hypocritical grabbers, the process of grabbing eliminating cooperation would proceed latent for a considerable time. Eventually, virtuous individuals withered away, the Virtue Selection Mechanism declined, and the civilization began to deconstruct, reverting to the Hobbesian Jungle State filled with grabbing and deception, where small groups engaged in endless grabbing struggles. As human Group Cooperation Degree decreased, science, technology, and even intelligent brains became burdens in individual struggles, ultimately leading to the loss of technological knowledge and intellectual regression. Of course, since these civilizations were not powerful enough to unify the entire world, primitive "barbarian" forces from the periphery continuously purged the corrupted ethnic groups in these regions, resulting in ethnic replacement. The old civilizations faded away, new civilizations began to take shape from the ruins, and after centuries, the old civilizations became lost to history.

### The Survival of Chinese Civilization to the Present Day
[Similarly, Chinese civilization entered cycles of autocratic centralization and grabbing. Yet, miraculously, Chinese civilization has survived, which almost no other ancient civilization has achieved.]() [I believe this outcome is closely related to the profound influence of the Rites of Zhou and Confucian culture on Chinese civilization. During the Zhou Dynasty, the Chinese people's emphasis on morality was unparalleled in the world; few other peoples have ever attached greater importance to virtue and virtuous governance. Moral instinct is the strongest antibody for four-dimensional life to resist "cancer cells."]() Although later autocratic emperors adopted a governance approach of "outwardly Confucian, inwardly Legalist"—paying lip service to Confucianism while practicing Legalism—any other ethnic group that conquered this land was invariably inspired by the ideas of the Rites of Zhou and Confucianism, resonating with them to varying degrees. Although this resonance was not strong enough to prevent the corruption of the ruling class, it exerted a broad and profound influence on the grassroots population. [The role of this moral sense and moral instinct is akin to an anti-cancer medicine for ailing civilizations, resisting cancerization. It has significantly delayed the process of corruption, grabbing, and decline of the Chinese nation. Ultimately, after enduring vicissitudes, Chinese civilization still retains the foundation and genetic resilience to stand among the nations of the world.]() 

[Before its distortion, the core spirit of the Rites of Zhou and Confucian culture was Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism; it was the awakening of self-awareness in high-dimensional life. The ideal of the Great Unity is the ideal of the integration of high-dimensional life.]() The core spirit and core culture of the Chinese nation have never been interrupted, despite several ups and downs and distortions. These include the Legalists' abandonment and subversion of Confucianism during the Pre-Qin period, but under pressure from scholar-officials and the public, Legalism was scarcely adopted overtly by any dynasty; the Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars by Qin Shi Huang, but the Qin Dynasty was quickly overthrown and destroyed; the Yuan nobility's resistance to sinicization, but they perished within a century; and Zhu Yuanzhang's attempt to remove Mencius from the Confucian temple, which was opposed by scholars nationwide and thus abandoned. China has repeatedly been ruled by surrounding ethnic minorities, but almost all ruling ethnic groups have eventually sinicized and been assimilated into the core culture of China. What the Chinese nation has fought and died to protect is this culture, not a single dynasty or family. Dynasties and families will eventually decay and decline, but this spiritual culture can sustain the Chinese nation's long-term survival. 

Many people do not recognize the continuity of Chinese civilization's inheritance. Some even claim, "No China after Yashan, no Huaxia after the fall of the Ming, no Han ethnicity after the Qing." Such claims are overly extreme. From a demographic perspective, the Chinese nation did endure immense shocks during these major historical upheavals. For example, the population of China was nearly halved around the time of the Battle of Yashan (some accounts suggest an 80% loss). However, the remaining population base was still large. Moreover, this population underwent a form of selection: on the surface, loyal subjects of the former dynasty who continued to resist were suppressed, while sycophantic individuals with no backbone secured better official careers. In reality, the Yuan Dynasty exerted very weak control over local areas, which is why Yuan drama culture flourished. Overall, local counties during the Yuan Dynasty were nearly autonomous, a state that actually facilitated the reformation of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genes. Ultimately, ethnic groups with stronger Group Cooperation Degree, lower hypocrisy, fewer grabbers, and better cohesion survived. In fact, the scholar-official clans, as middle-level life forms, were highly cohesive, similar to the manorial system's cohesion during medieval Europe. Thus, during this turbulent period, ethnic groups containing free-riders, hypocrites, tyrants, and grabbing exploiters were indirectly eliminated. Under immense pressure, "tumor genes" within the Chinese nation found it even harder to survive—a process analogous to radiation and chemotherapy. However, the bloodline and culture of the Chinese nation were not interrupted; more "cancer cells" were eliminated, making the nation purer and enabling rebirth. 

Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that each major military loss inflicted enormous damage to the nation's vitality, which took centuries to recover. Yet, when "cancer cells" pervade the body and no better targeted therapy is available, chemotherapy and radiation are reluctantly necessary choices.

### Repeated Fragmentation and Rebirth of Western Civilization
In comparison, the rise and fall of Western civilization have been more thorough. Even excluding the ancient Sumerian civilization, Western civilization and its cultural centers have undergone multiple replacements. Western civilization initially centered on the Greek people, then on the Romans. Rome transitioned from the early republican system, to the mid-period principate, to the later imperial system resembling Eastern empires with the gradual adoption of Christianity, with its capital moved from Rome to Constantinople—itself a form of cultural fragmentation. The first five centuries of the Medieval period under Germanic rule marked a major fragmentation of Western civilization. Except for Christianity, both ethnic composition and culture underwent profound changes. For centuries, Greek culture nearly vanished from Western Europe; instead, it was inherited by the emerging Islamic states of Arabia. Aristotle's rational spirit was rediscovered only five hundred years later, largely through transmission from Arab civilization.

The evolutionary logic underlying Western civilization can be broadly summarized as follows: First, the once-dominant Greek people began to decay. As individual cooperative qualities declined, they transitioned from cooperation to grabbingism, and the Athenian-centered Greek city-states devolved from democracy into mob rule, ultimately losing their group competitiveness. Then the Roman people rose to prominence. Initially simple, resolute, tolerant, and learned, they subjugated neighboring peoples and reached the zenith of their power.  

Rome first experienced corruption within the ruling senatorial class, who engaged in grabbing resources from the people. A series of efforts and reforms by figures such as the Gracchi brothers, Caesar, and Octavian slowed this process. Later, Rome entered a phase of systemic corruption, spreading outward from the traditional Roman core. Over centuries of degenerative cancerization, as the core ethnic group deepened its grabbing tendencies and complacency, it first lost the ability to sustain the democratic-republican consular system, then even the senatorial system. Christianity temporarily mitigated corruption during this period, but it was ultimately a superficial remedy. In the end, the Roman civilization, centered on the thoroughly corrupted, indulgent, and slothful Roman people—plagued by internal scheming—reached its end. The fall of Rome marked the "death" of Roman civilization.  

Rome was conquered by the younger, more pure Germanic peoples, causing Western civilization to regress significantly. Living standards plummeted, sanitation deteriorated, and plagues proliferated; during the early Middle Ages, average life expectancy dropped to around thirty years, and Latin, once a thriving language, became a dead classical tongue. The Germanic peoples gradually evolved from tribes into states, slowly reconstructing civilization—a process that spanned nearly a millennium. During this period, European civilization was largely inherited and advanced by the emerging Islamic civilization, which later "circled back" to Western Europe.  

As a nascent people, the Germanic tribes were initially devout Christians, but in their reemergence as a civilized society, they too succumbed to corruption. Hypocrisy, lust for power, and infighting resurfaced. The corruption of the Church drastically altered Christianity, and the corruption of the nobility eroded royal legitimacy. A prolonged struggle for power and interests erupted between the Church and secular rulers; the Church even resorted to selling indulgences to exploit wealth. This sparked a revolution within the Church, giving birth to Protestantism. However, Protestantism found it difficult to rejuvenate within Europe’s corrupted framework. Fortunately, its adherents (particularly the Anglo-Saxons) found a "new body" in the Americas, escaping the cancerous cells of corruption—for such cells naturally gravitated toward the wealthier, more resource-rich European heartland, where grabbing was easier to sustain. These younger, less cancerized Protestant settlers thrived in the new American soil, pioneering a new peak of human civilization over the following centuries.  

It must be emphasized here that [long-term survival of a civilization is not inherently more praiseworthy or advanced than a model of periodic disruption and rebirth]. Moreover, the divergent trajectories of Eastern and Western civilizations are not the result of subjective choices but are determined by objective geographical factors. In fact, [long-surviving civilizations face greater difficulty in making progress, whereas the disruption or death of old civilizations creates better conditions for the rebirth of new ones—this is the fundamental reason Western civilization has historically outpaced Eastern civilization]. Ancient civilizations, chronically afflicted by deep-seated "cancer," suffer from severe internal strife and low cooperation degrees; their mere survival is a triumph, leaving little room for advancement. [A non-cancerized, newly born "body," after enduring a fragile infancy, can rapidly grow and surpass older civilizations.]  

[Western civilization resembles a typical life form, continuously cycling through growth, procreation, and death—a pattern that better eliminates cancerous elements. In contrast, Chinese civilization is akin to an aging individual, struggling to survive through self-remediation and external pressures, like a patient enduring repeated rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.]  

The reason we must study and value the evolution of Chinese civilization is this: As global integration deepens and technological development advances, civilizations may no longer afford the "luxury" of death. With the world fully integrated, the "body" of old civilizations occupies all regions, and cancerous cells of corruption permeate every corner of the globe. There will be insufficient "soil" to nurture new civilizations, making such a "death" far more complete—and potentially irreversible.  


### Instinct Determines Institutions—Why Aging Bodies Cannot Bear Advanced Systems  
The conclusion that "instinct determines institutions" was introduced in the previous chapter, and this chapter reaffirms it. Take the revolutions of the Enlightenment era: the American Revolution achieved far more thorough and tangible results than the French Revolution. [This stark contrast vividly reflects how differing degrees of group cancerization determined vastly different outcomes for movements of the same kind—internal factors outweigh external ones.]  

Since Tocqueville, many have noted the role of America’s tradition of self-governance in its success, but this is not the critical internal cause. Self-governance is merely a natural expression of a people with low cancerization. It is not an American invention: [Europe and Japan both experienced prolonged periods of self-governance during their civilizational ascents]. Self-governance is humanity’s oldest tradition, practiced by many "barbarian" peoples in ancient times. [Mature empires in their later stages, however, often abandon this tradition—Rome being a prime example—because their national character has degenerated. In such cases, self-governance and republicanism easily descend into endless disputes of hypocrisy, fraud, and sophistry; autocracy, though led by a self-interested ruler, becomes more efficient. This is a regrettable necessity.]  

[Self-governance and republican institutions require a high-dimensional consciousness and moral instinct among the implementing group to align with them.] High-dimensional instincts manifest in many ways, starting with tolerance. During the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese people exemplified such instincts and consciousness. Self-governance depends on tolerance and magnanimity—cooperative instincts—to sustain itself. As discussed in the first volume, the story of Duke Xiang of Song illustrates this: warfare during the Spring and Autumn period was not about annihilating enemies but about competing in strength and courage, essentially testing which group had a higher cooperation degree. This was a form of "noble spirit," a quintessential high-dimensional ethos. However, this spirit was lost early in Chinese history. For example, during the Warring States period, King Huai of Chu was imprisoned and died after attending a conference at Wuguan, a grabbing act that violated basic diplomatic norms. In contrast, European culture has historically shown far greater magnanimity toward enemies in conflict. When Henry II and Stephen vied for the English throne, they did not fight to the death. Even after Henry’s victory, they negotiated a settlement: Stephen remained king but named Henry his heir, who would ascend upon Stephen’s death—an outcome unthinkable in a mutually distrustful Chinese dynasty. Similarly, Napoleon was defeated twice; though seen as a grave threat, he was merely exiled to an island (and later returned), rather than executed.  

[Institutional self-consistency hinges on the premise that grabbing instincts have not fully taken root, and cooperative instincts still dominate—such that a group does not seize every opportunity to annex others, nor live in constant fear of being annexed.] In a degenerating group, however, grabbing and guarding against grabbing form a vicious cycle, reinforcing each other. As discussed in Volume I, [hypocritical grabbing indirectly undermines human trust, lowering expectations of the "moral average." The adage "an innocent man is guilty merely for possessing a jade" becomes a common occurrence]. When trust fades, eliminating rivals is sometimes driven by necessity—learned from historical lessons. The Han Dynasty’s "reduction of fiefdoms" exemplifies this trust trap: [the central ruler feared vassals would rebel, and the vassals feared the ruler would strip them of power]. Mutual suspicion deepened, driving them apart. Chao Cuo, a Han statesman, famously declared: ["Rebellion will occur whether we reduce the fiefdoms or not. If we reduce them, rebellion will come sooner but be less severe; if we do not, rebellion will come later but be more catastrophic."] Chao’s judgment was not wrong—he made a rational assessment based on the societal moral average of his time. The group had entered a prisoner’s dilemma, whose only solution lies in the moral instincts of high-dimensional life. By then, however, China’s noble spirit had faded, leaving mutual destruction as the only outcome. Self-governance became unsustainable, and centralization, weakening of the populace, and isolationism became nearly inevitable choices—much like how Caesar, recognizing the corruption of Rome’s senatorial class and the "death" of republicanism under the era’s moral average, had no option but to adopt the autocratic principate.  

[Partisanship over principle was already pronounced during the Jin Dynasty. Similar dynamics emerged in Western history only during the French Revolution, but never as intensely. Executing three or even nine generations of a family was routine to eliminate future threats—far more brutal than anything seen in Europe. The factional strife of the late Ming Dynasty was even more ruthless, insidious, and unreasonable.]  

The Glorious Revolution succeeded in England without bloodshed; the American Revolution triumphed; yet the French Revolution failed to achieve similar success in France. The Meiji Restoration transformed Japan, but China’s Hundred Days’ Reform, modeled on it, ended in tragedy. All these outcomes stem from differences in the high-dimensional instincts of different peoples at the time. [Thus, the divergent fates of nations are not fundamentally due to differing institutions, but to differences in national character, levels of civilizational aging, innate instincts, moral averages, cooperation degrees, and the extent of high-dimensional awakening versus grabbing degeneration.]  

[Human instincts subtly determine the formulation and implementation of institutions. Malicious instincts drastically increase the operational costs of institutions—sometimes even exceeding the cooperative dividends they generate—while others exploit institutional loopholes, rendering them ineffective.]

In the foreseeable future, human beings will remain of primary importance, surpassing institutional frameworks. Only individuals endowed with virtuous natures and wisdom can create sound institutions and diligently uphold them. Such well-constructed institutions, in turn, will continue to nurture and refine these virtuous human qualities.  

### Why Modern Western Civilization Has Achieved Greater Progress  
All things peak before they decline. After approximately three hundred years of prosperity, cancerous cells begin to insidiously proliferate within most groups—even the United States, once a beacon of human civilization, now finds itself on a downward trajectory. The world’s best social systems can only delay this process of degenerative cancerization, not eradicate it entirely. *No truly radical social system capable of halting cancerization has yet emerged.*  

Owing to geographical factors, Western civilization has undergone a cycle of "civilizational death and rebirth," with its cultural epicenter continuously shifting. In contrast, Chinese civilization has experienced a protracted process of recurring ailments, periodic "blood transfusions" for self-healing, and a gradual deterioration. To draw an imperfect analogy: Western civilization, having undergone generational renewal, resembles a vigorous thirty-something individual. Chinese civilization, however, is akin to a centenarian elder, riddled with cancer. Consequently, while Chinese civilization retains its heroic spirit, the number of cancerized "petty individuals" (grabbing-oriented persons) far outweighs the virtuous. This imbalance naturally results in significantly lower levels of collective cooperation and cooperative dividends compared to nascent nations and emerging ethnic groups. Over nearly two millennia of gradual decline, Chinese civilization has been excluded from all achievements spawned by cooperative dividends—its once-brilliant cultural fruits have faded. The Chinese nation has been trapped in a millennial cycle of short-sighted grabbing, factional strife, court intrigue, and systemic deception. Even during its rare golden eras, rulers diverted the attention of intellectuals through the servility-inducing imperial examination system and filial piety culture. While such measures reduced governance costs, these grabbing-oriented tactics ultimately stifled scientific innovation. This stands in stark contrast to Western nations, where monarchical and papal support for scientific innovation—driven by intergroup competitive pressures—fostered collaborative efforts to create cooperative dividends, such as the establishment of royal academies. Unsurprisingly, scientific, technological, and institutional advancements—hallmarks of cooperative endeavors—proved elusive for Chinese civilization.  

#### Younger Western Civilization Boasts Higher Collective Moral Standards  
Though Eastern civilizations have historically emphasized moral discourse, within groups rife with hypocrisy, deep-seated cancerization, and grabbing behavior, morality has often devolved into a tool for moral coercion, with double standards rampant. Meanwhile, Western civilization, long shaped by religious influences (even as religion itself later became corrupt), retained a baseline of moral stability through Protestantism, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment’s rational spirit. *The actual average moral instinct of Eastern civilization—particularly in matters of public virtue—has long lagged behind that of Western emerging ethnic groups.*  

The "morality" discussed here is not the traditional intuitive morality but rather the moral framework derived from the laws of adversarial evolution. *Because, over two millennia of decline, the Chinese nation’s overall moral standards and high-dimensional instincts have fallen far short of those of Western civilization; even its superficially proclaimed collectivism has been supplanted by refined individualism and hypocrisyism. Thus, it is entirely understandable why Chinese civilization lagged behind the West in modern achievements.*  

This is analogous to how a young person’s somatic cells are far healthier and less cancerized than an elderly person’s. Additionally, the multipolar population aggregation structure of the West—characterized by fragmented geography and competing groups—has spurred internal cooperation. External competitive pressures have bound group interests closely to individual short-term interests, compelling ethnic groups to cooperate to avoid extinction. Tumors are invincible internally but impotent externally; external threats can act as a "cure" for internal cancerization. Limited external invasions, akin to chemotherapy, have unexpectedly retarded tumor growth, creating space for healthy cells to thrive. Under such conditions, it is no surprise that scientific and technological advancements—products of cooperation—flourished under state and societal support.  

#### Rule-Constrained Individualism Aligns More with Morality Than Hypocrisy-Disguised Collectivism  
Furthermore, the individualism championed by the Western Enlightenment has counterbalanced the hypocrisy fostered by religion and imperial power. This is not to denounce collectivism per se, but most short-sighted collectivist ideals—advocating universal equality and equal distribution—amount to a form of moral PUA by hypocrites, facilitating free-riderism and grabbing. Such systems fail to allocate resources to high-contributing individuals or enable the spread of their virtuous genes. *These superficially "fair" and "just" collectivist practices undermine long-term group interests and even accelerate the proliferation of hypocritical grabbing genes.*  

For example, when "helpers" choose to "lie flat" and enjoy the excess benefits created by others rather than supporting brilliant thinkers and scientists, society would be better served if those thinkers and scientists acted "selfishly"—accumulating resources to maximize their contributions. *In this context, using individualism to counteract hypocrisyism generates greater cooperative dividends than mere collectivism, enabling virtuous and excellent genes to propagate more widely. This approach actually aligns with true collectivism.*  

*An inefficient, hypocritical, and conflict-ridden cooperative relationship is inferior to a clear-cut, non-cooperative state.* (This critical point is repeated three times for emphasis.)  

Chinese culture’s emphasis on harmony and peace is inherently positive, but this conciliatory attitude *has been exploited by grabbing-oriented individuals to negative effect.* Blind, dogmatic pursuit of harmony has emboldened those who "make trouble" to claim benefits—a dynamic akin to a high-dimensional organism, aware of its internal tumors, "punishing both immune cells and cancer cells equally" to maintain peace. *Such a refusal to confront reality—this "avoidance of acknowledging illness"—harms the collective, undermines high-dimensional life, and violates high-dimensional morality.*  

Western achievements do not stem directly from individualism; rather, individualism mitigates the negative effects of cancerization and hypocrisy. Though nominally "individualism defeating collectivism," the reality is that a more efficient, farsighted form of collectivism has triumphed over superficial individualism.  

#### The Peril of Overvaluing Individualism: Exhausting Human Virtue and Plunging into Abyss  
The notion that the West succeeded due to individualism is a superficial, foolish, and dangerous misunderstanding. This perilous ideology is evident in works like *Atlas Shrugged*:  

> **Moral View**—The sole purpose of morality in your life is to attain happiness; pursuing your own joy is its highest moral goal. "Sacrifice" means giving up what you value for something you care little about. Human life is the standard of morality; in life, joy signifies success, while suffering leads to death. Just as you cannot falsify nature, you cannot fabricate human character. Force and reason are diametrically opposed; when a gun is fired, morality perishes.  

> **Value System**—Human beings are true heroes: they take their own happiness as the moral compass of life, view tangible achievements as the noblest actions, and regard reason as their sole master. One should not live for others, nor demand others live for oneself. Thinking is humanity’s most fundamental virtue, from which all others spring. Pride means recognizing yourself as your highest value—a value, like all others, that must be earned.  

Ayn Rand further asserts: "Reason is humanity’s only correct judge of value and guide to action. The proper moral standard is: man exists as man. Reason is humanity’s basic virtue; its three most important values are reason, purpose, and self-respect. Every individual is self-sufficient, not existing to satisfy others; one must live for oneself, neither sacrificing oneself for others nor others for oneself; one must take the pursuit of personal happiness as life’s highest moral goal and work for one’s rational self-interest."  

Upon closer examination, these ideas are inherently contradictory. *If one lives solely for oneself—neither sacrificing oneself for others nor others for oneself—how can one avoid sacrificing others’ interests for one’s own?* From an absolute individualist perspective, these two principles are fundamentally conflicting, and reason only amplifies this logical inconsistency. Thus, reason and this flaw create a new, irreconcilable contradiction: how can each individual, rationally maximizing their own interests, avoid endless internal strife?  

That said, *Atlas Shrugged*’s elitist ideas contain valid insights, which do not inherently conflict with collectivism. I will elaborate on this critical point in the section "Symbiotic Communitarianism" of Volume III.

The illusion that "Western civilization is superior due to individualism" is profoundly eroding the foundations of Western civilization itself and even all of human civilization. This stems from erroneous criteria for judging success, a flawed admiration for strength, and a misplaced sense of moral complacency. Pushing individualism to its extreme would lead to catastrophic consequences. Such thinking within Western civilization resembles the naive recklessness of an impetuous young man unversed in life’s complexities.  

The rapid development of Western civilization has been built upon group selection and the long-standing religious cultivation of innate adherence to virtue and justice. Meanwhile, the resplendent achievements of Western market economies have been sustained by overexploiting humanity’s inherent goodness. To exalt individualism and elitism while neglecting collectivism, mutual support, and cooperation is profoundly dangerous. This ideological trend shares fundamental similarities with the individualistic thoughts of Legalism that emerged after the collapse of rites and music. At its core, it enables the elite class to act self-interestedly: to control others through laws, tactics, and authority; to treat the people as tools and stepping stones for their own ambitions; and to attempt to channel humanity’s innate inclinations toward evil into acts of goodness and cooperation through legal forms alone. Such thinking trapped Chinese civilization in a millennium-long cycle of stagnation and decline.  

We hope humanity will soon correct this erroneous perception. The positive effects of Western individualism have been exhausted, and its side effects are now manifesting in South Korea, Japan, China, the United States, and all major civilizations worldwide. Ultimately, the most likely force to save the world may well be the oldest wisdom originating from the East.  

While the once-vibrant vitality of Western civilization deserves our study, the far more compelling subject is how Chinese civilization, despite prolonged cancerization and aging, has miraculously survived—even rejuvenating itself and enduring through the ages. This phenomenon contains partial, yet critical, answers to preventing the extinction of human civilization.  

### Why Has Chinese Civilization Endured So Long and Remained Ever-Vibrant?  
Chinese civilization is known as the world’s only unbroken civilization—the only high-dimensional life form that has never perished. This has profound underlying causes. Since the Zhou Dynasty, and further elevated by Confucius, the Chinese people have always prioritized moral character. This has undoubtedly enabled the nation’s self-purification. Confucius, revered as the "Teacher for Ten Thousand Generations," is no empty title; he embedded the ideals of junzi (noble individuals) and virtue into the very genes and bloodstream of the Chinese nation through cultural forms. This is a charge rooted in the deepest recesses of the Chinese genome and the most fundamental essence of Chinese civilization. The family maxims of most scholarly clans, such as Zhou Bingyi’s admonitions to his siblings and descendants in *A Lifelong Journey*, reflect this: "Future generations of the Zhou family may become all kinds of people, but they must never be without virtue. They need not necessarily be what society deems 'successful,' but they must never be people who do not love their families or their country." All the glory and mission of the Chinese nation are tied to this high-dimensional life spirit.  

Virtue and patriotism have become the strongest anti-cancer genetic mechanisms of the Chinese nation. The rise and fall of dynasties, so long as this cultural tradition remains unbroken, merely entails replacing a "governing brain" with a more lucid one. The survival of the nation, however, hinges on the preservation of virtue and culture. In such moments, the true backbone of the Chinese people rises. During the period of the Five Barbarians' Invasion, the Han people, as a whole, had become severely cancerized, with court intrigues like those of the Rebellion of the Eight Princes playing out daily. Yet even in this darkness, figures like Liu Kun, Zu Ti, Xie An, and Xie Xuan emerged as pillars of strength, staving off collapse for years, exhausting multiple foreign dynasties, and compelling their sinicization, thus fostering great ethnic integration. Had they not performed these miracles, the Han people might have been swept away utterly. This stands in stark contrast to the rapid collapse of the Western Roman Empire, where its culture was buried by history, and its lands were nearly occupied by foreign peoples, leading to a civilizational reset.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1cf3001-8317-43a9-a3c6-ee1475c8bffa" />
</p>  

In every subsequent moment of national peril, such heroes have arisen: Yue Fei, Lu Xiufu, Wen Tianxiang, Yuan Chonghuan, Shi Kefa, Zhang Huangyan. They may not have prevented dynastic decline or the changing of regimes; on the surface, they appear to have failed, their lifelong efforts seemingly fruitless. Yet their cause was supremely successful. For they existed not to defend dynasties, but to prove that Han culture and spirit endured. They commanded the respect of their adversaries, who dared not regard the Han people as a degraded, contemptible life form. Otherwise, the Han’s fate would have mirrored that of the ancient Egyptians, Carthaginians, Romans, or Native Americans. Instead, their adversaries could only view the Han as a partially corrupted yet still equal—or even higher-dimensional—life form, compelling these former foes to adopt thorough sinicization measures to coexist and integrate. Without these national heroes and their followers, the Chinese nation would have vanished from history long ago. Indeed, were any other nation in the world subjected to such a period of great corruption, no matter how excellent their institutions, they would likely not have survived.  

This pattern holds in modern history. In the late Qing Dynasty, Chinese civilization once again entered a cycle of decay. Confronted with foreign aggression, the highly cooperative Communist Party of China rose to lead the nation. A group of rare individuals—ambitious, idealistic, and faith-driven—emerged as leaders. Their "spark," under the pressure of national survival, quickly ignited a prairie fire, defeating the Kuomintang (KMT), an old-style bureaucratic organization riddled with hypocrisy, infighting, and low cooperation. The KMT, despite holding absolute advantages in political legitimacy, military technology, economic strength, talent, and foreign support, was routed by the Communist forces, who fought with "millet and rifles," enduring hardship and privation. This outcome is utterly incomprehensible to the Western world, defying their historical understanding. They struggle to grasp the true depth and formative processes of the Chinese nation’s character.  

This was a high-dimensional life form within the Chinese nation delivering a dimensionality-reducing blow to its lower-dimensional counterpart. While seemingly miraculous, it was inherently inevitable—a reality Mao Zedong discerned early when he noted, "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Though the Chinese nation suffered great losses in this process, most of its "cancer cells" were eliminated, particularly those in its "governing brain," allowing normal "cells" to reclaim control of the body’s command center. This undoubtedly bought precious time for the nation’s rebirth. All these achievements are inseparable from the moral culture established by the Chinese nation thousands of years ago.  

So long as a nation’s virtue and moral integrity endure, it retains the capacity for self-revolution, reawakening, and re-ascension to higher dimensions. Western nations, whether Greece or Rome, have faltered in the face of similar challenges. Other countries worldwide have proven powerless as well. In contrast, the core spirit of the Chinese nation—Confucian (Zhou ritual) culture—has persisted from the Three Dynasties to the present day. Though it has undergone countless distortions and misinterpretations, its internal spiritual drive continues to sustain the Chinese people’s progress. By correcting the distortions and strengthening the deficiencies in traditional Chinese culture through the lens of Adversarial Evolution theory, and by humbly, principledly, and selectively absorbing the闪光点 of Western civilization, Chinese culture will remain advanced—even visionary. This visionary quality is nearly the sole path to resolving humanity’s major future economic, political, and war-related challenges.  

We need not shy away from acknowledging our shortcomings, flaws, and errors; instead, we should analyze them with candor. We have no cause for shame regarding our nation’s past; rather, we should take pride in our historical resilience and present awareness. Having finally understood the roots of our decline, and having experienced these painful lessons, we can now develop profound insights. By summoning the courage to acknowledge our past failings, we gain the capacity to correct them. With this, we can address our issues with reason, steering our nation toward new horizons. When we resolve our own problems, this will constitute humanity’s greatest treasure, guiding all nations toward a brighter future.  

Ninety years ago, the May Fourth pioneers invited John Dewey, Bertrand Russell, and Rabindranath Tagore to lecture in China. Tagore’s repeated admonitions were profound: "If you merely mimic the West, arming yourselves with Western cosmologies, state ideologies, and life philosophies, one day you may believe yourselves independent and strong, but in reality, you will have been conquered." Tagore further stated, "I hope China will inherit and preserve its great, complete spirit and humanist traditions—so desperately needed in today’s world. May China establish a rational, healthy social and economic system, and lead humanity out of its迷途 in science and art. If this is achieved, all of humanity will thank China with profound reverence."  

China’s experiences are not only its pride but also its most precious treasure, requiring constant refinement and propagation. They will help us better understand ourselves, enabling clearer discernment of what is superior or inferior, good or bad. Only by knowing darkness can we uphold light; only by acknowledging shame can we strive for excellence. Through this treasure, humanity may yet achieve true self-redemption, finding its mission and value in the vast, heat-death-bound universe.  

## The Crisis of the Global Village: Civilizational Collective Aging

As previously discussed, the geographic factors of China have contributed to the formation of the "Sinocentric Evolutionary Crisis." This crisis arises from a unique terrestrial configuration: a landmass enclosed by natural barriers on all sides, with a vast, fertile central plain surrounded by desolate regions. Within this confined space, multiple states and ethnic groups engaged in intense struggles for survival—clashing directly with no escape routes. Ultimately, only a unifying centralized empire could bring temporary peace. However, such an empire, lacking neighboring competitors of comparable scale, faces a prolonged cycle of corruption and eventual replacement by younger external empires. During this extended period without external pressure, intra-individual grabbingism within the state intensifies, leading to a dramatic rise in the proportion of grabbingist genotypes. The empire thus enters a state of ["Grabbing Enclosure"](), where interpersonal cooperation plummets, mutual exploitation becomes the norm, and progress stagnates or even regresses.  

This prolonged state of enclosure has fostered overfitted, hyper-specialized genes adept at grabbing and hypocrisy—manifested in the endless imperial court infighting and factional strife that characterize China’s cyclical dynastic history. China established a centralized imperial system over a millennium earlier than other civilizations and has spent most subsequent millennia under unified rule. This extended period of enclosure has driven individual evolution into an overfitted state: the Chinese are not "insufficiently intelligent," but rather *too* clever, *too* shrewd, and *too* "capable" in ways that grievously undermine cooperative capacities.  

Consider foreign enterprises in China, initially managed by expatriates with robust welfare systems and minimal cutthroat practices. Over time, however, "elite" Chinese business managers—touted for superior performance—have displaced these expatriates. Their "performance improvements" often rely on exploiting subordinates, slandering peers, and currying favor with superiors. We must recognize that these issues transcend institutional solutions—at least those currently known. [To date, no political system or state structure has truly resolved the problem of declining and regressive cooperation in ultra-large groups. This issue, at the root of "big company syndrome" in corporations, of dynastic decline in nations, and of potential extinction for species (including humanity), poses a far greater existential threat than environmental degradation, war, plague, or viruses.]() Indeed, this root cause perpetuates such crises, unfolding like a slow-boiling frog: the proportion of grabbingist genotypes in the human gene pool shifts insidiously, reaching a tipping point where reversal becomes impossible. The "final complications" may appear as environmental collapse, war, or plague, but the true cause lies in the underlying "cancerization."  

Elon Musk, during an interview in Indonesia, noted: "Most Chinese elites prioritize self-interest and social maneuvering over technological innovation." Having worked in R&D and management at top Chinese tech companies, I find this observation strikingly accurate—if anything, the reality is more severe. These companies boast advanced systems and forward-thinking management, yet human behavior distorts institutional goals. The Chinese are not lacking in intelligence or diligence; rather, their ingenuity and effort are misdirected.  

Chinese history abounds with power struggle narratives. [In cycles of mutual suspicion—anticipating others’ distrust, second-guessing their anticipation of ours—individuals are forced into choices that, collectively, prove disastrous. This culture of hypocrisy and broken trust inflicts massive group losses, which can entirely negate the benefits of intellectual capital.]() To understand this paradox, we must revisit China’s evolutionary history. Only through this lens can we also discern the future trajectories of younger global ethnic groups, which, under the gravitational pull of grabbingism, are rapidly declining—entangled in moral posturing, racial tensions, gun debates, and trans identity conflicts. [So-called "universal values" falter in the face of complexity, contradicting themselves and failing to cohere.]()  

This decline mirrors the inevitability of aging and death. [Historically, primitive human societies addressed the "aging" of ultra-large groups through group competition: the aged group was eliminated. Ethnic replacement has persisted for millennia; even an ancient civilization like China has undergone multiple large-scale demographic transformations (e.g., the Sixteen Kingdoms, Five Dynasties, Yaishan Battle, and Ming-Qing transition).]() Such replacements temporarily suppressed "cancerous" elements. However, as global economic and cultural integration deepens, [the "global village" has gradually emerged as humanity’s sole super-massive group.]() If Earth unifies into a single entity, with all regions aging and cancerizing synchronously, and cancer cells metastasizing unimpeded, who will eliminate it? Could humanity endure the catastrophic cost of such elimination?  

[Today, Earth has no "New World," no "virgin lands," and little space for nascent ethnic groups. The world may soon descend into a Sinocentric Dilemma—a transformation unseen in tens of thousands of years.]() The elimination of entire groups, once part of natural order (as with the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Native Americans), is now unsustainable. [For the first time in history, the biosphere is nearly full, and technological destructiveness surpasses Earth’s regenerative capacity. Humanity’s fate is now intertwined with the survival of this blue planet.]()[Pessimistically, humanity may have entered a dead end. Our collective wisdom must surpass an unprecedented threshold to achieve self-redemption.]()  

China’s history thus holds immense value: it foreshadows the crises and fates of other global powers and humanity at large. Here, we find the most vivid living specimens of human "cancer cells." Chinese history is an invaluable treasure in humanity’s historical experience, documenting in depth the crises we will face in future evolution—and hinting at potential solutions.  

As emphasized earlier, institutions alone are insufficient. Even the finest systems cannot withstand the erosion of grabbingist decline. Rome’s republican system was exemplary, yet senatorial corruption (grabbingist decline, refusing to grant plebeians greater rights) and citizen decadence (grabbingist decline, prioritizing indulgence) doomed it to collapse. [Whether autocracy, minority-led republicanism, or majority-led democracy—no system escapes the fate of degenerating into grabbingist decline.]() This process spans decades to centuries. Nations that believe democracy guarantees eternal vitality are already witnessing grabbingist decline silently corroding their once-young, healthy foundations. Full-body cancerization is merely a matter of time.  

The Sinocentric Evolutionary Crisis is now taking global form, marked by: [shrinking group interaction distances, the emergence of a globally closed system, the absence of external pressures beyond the "global village," and a lack of virgin lands for new groups. In this environment, cancer cells metastasize unimpeded, with no external forces to eliminate them. Moreover, the potential value extractable by hypocritical grabbingists is unprecedented, prolonging their corruption cycles and deepening decay.]()  

As the *Tao Te Ching* states: "Disaster is the companion of fortune; fortune is the hidden disaster." In a sense, the Chinese have prematurely experienced later stages of evolution—multiple cycles of peak-to-decline—a rare and invaluable experience among global ethnic groups. I suspect that even individuals from self-proclaimed "superior" ethnicities, placed in China’s historical context, would not have escaped this fate. Exposing their societies to such cancerous elements would similarly lead to reverse selection. Yet, despite enduring millennia of grabbingist and hypocrisyist genetic infiltration, our nation has persisted, forged ahead, and sought rejuvenation—a testament to resilience.  

The wheel of history rolls on, unfolding tragedies and comedies that speak to its grandeur and sorrow. If it seems merciless, it is because it adheres unwaveringly to evolutionary laws, unaffected by individual virtue or vice. If it seems compassionate, it is because through these merciless narratives, it reiterates the immutable laws of evolution. For us, the present generation, if we remain indifferent—lamenting the past without learning from it—we will merely perpetuate the cycle, leaving future generations to mourn our own failures. Perhaps even that chance for lamentation will vanish.
