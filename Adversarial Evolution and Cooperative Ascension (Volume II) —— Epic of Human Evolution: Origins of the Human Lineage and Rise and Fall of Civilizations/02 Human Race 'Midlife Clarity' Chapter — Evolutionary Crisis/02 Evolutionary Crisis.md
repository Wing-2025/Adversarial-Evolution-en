# Evolutionary Crisis  
As we introduced earlier, the Great Leap Period was an era when human brains and genes were most adapted to human social structures, which we may even refer to as the Edenic Period of humanity. During this period, the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism could almost resolve all issues, and human groups were in an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) state. The optimal choice for individual humans was also clear—continuously elevating their "virtue" level. Here, "virtue" refers to virtue in the context of Adversarial Evolution, whose definition was elaborated in the chapter on Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism and will not be repeated here. From the perspective of individual adaptation, individuals with higher virtue levels could receive greater rewards from Virtue Selection and avoid its penalties; from the perspective of group adaptation, the group's cooperation degree was unprecedentedly enhanced, cooperative dividends were abundantly released, and the competitiveness of human groups was significantly elevated. During this period, members within human groups were affectionate toward one another. Except when confronting evil individuals, people were kind and helpful to one another, and conflicts between individuals were not severe.  

Subsequently, as the cooperation degree continued to rise, tools and technologies constantly innovated, [the population size of human communities kept increasing, the scale of different human ethnic groups expanded, and the competitive situation faced by humans gradually shifted from past competition between humans and other biological groups in nature to conflicts and competition between human groups](). Limited arable land suitable for agriculture and naturally irrigated locations meant that when many human ethnic groups were oppressed by other ethnic groups with no place to escape, and had to wage wars to defend their right to survival, human society effectively entered a new phase—the [period of intensified group conflicts](). During this period, the Pandora's box of Group Grabbingism was opened, and humanity's ancient Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism faced enormous challenges—[this constitutes one aspect of the human evolutionary crisis]().  

Meanwhile, as Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genes had already attained a majority proportion in human groups, Hypocrisyism, which evolves in opposition to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, also gained greater developmental space than at any previous time. [Against this backdrop, Hypocrisyism has proliferated like a virus within Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism groups, forming another aspect of the evolutionary crisis](). Here, we cannot overlook the development of human intelligence and the formation of logical thinking, [whose roles are dual: they enable us to distinguish virtue from evil, comprehend natural and scientific truths, yet can also be used for hypocrisy, cunning, and deception]().  

Although today, our science, technology, and art are advancing rapidly. People's living standards continue to improve, metropolises are taking shape, skyscrapers are rising, and internet culture appears thriving. Waves of technological trends—computers, the internet, mobile devices, artificial intelligence, and the metaverse—are driving humanity to pioneer one new era after another. Breakthroughs in pharmaceutical technology, cancer treatment, and genetic engineering are also raising the upper limit of human lifespan. Humanity seems to have entered its most splendid era, with a seemingly bright future. However, from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, humanity today is actually facing an unprecedented crisis. [The core cause of this crisis lies in the fact that the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genotype can no longer maintain an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)](). [The role of morality is on the verge of collapse, the Virtue Selection mechanism is being continuously weakened, yet no new mechanism has been established. Although the vision of the legal mechanism is noble, it cannot fill all gaps]().  

From the later stages of the Great Leap Period to before the Zhou-Qin Transformation, the evolutionary stability (ESS) of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genotype—upon which human rise and prosperity have depended—has been challenged as never before. This is a process of quantitative change leading to qualitative change, which constitutes the greatest contradiction and dilemma faced by human society over the past few millennia. [Human genetic mechanisms remain in the prehistoric hunter-gatherer state, which has become ill-equipped to handle today's intricate adversarial gaming state]().  

In this chapter, we will use the theory of Adversarial Evolution to analyze the transformation of humanity's adversarial evolutionary environment since the Zhou-Qin Transformation and the crises it faces.
