# The Confucian-Legalist Controversy and the Crisis of Group Grabbingism  
The Zhou-Qin Transformation was a historic phase of milestone significance. The contention of a hundred schools of thought among the pre-Qin scholars was a unique phenomenon against the backdrop of this special period. Among these, the Confucian-Legalist Controversy is particularly typical, as it essentially reflects the changes in the broader context and trends of Adversarial Evolution. [The pre-Qin scholars attempted to resolve the unprecedented challenges of group Adversarial Evolution of their era using the simple Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism moral mechanisms from the human hunter-gatherer period, but ultimately failed. This caused human group competition to revert to the unordered, non-civilized Hobbesian Jungle State. Such impacts also severely undermined, from top to bottom, the Virtue Selection Mechanism that had long sustained human prosperity.]() In what follows, we will take the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Confucian and Legalist thoughts as the main thread, explore the principles of Adversarial Evolution therein, and revisit the emergence and impacts of Group Grabbingism in light of specific historical contexts.  

## The Dual Nature of Confucianism  

### Advancements of Confucian Doctrine  

#### Confucianism Originates from the Genetic Strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
In fact, the first volume of this book has already analyzed that Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism aligns closely with the definition of the "noble person" (junzi) in Confucianism. Except for adopting a slightly compromising stance on punishing evil, Confucianism can be said to derive entirely from the genetic strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. When we speak of Confucianism, we immediately think of the "Sage of All Ages," Confucius. The status of Confucius and Confucianism in Chinese culture, particularly the lofty position it holds in the hearts of Chinese scholars, can be glimpsed from a statement in Mr. Liu Yimou’s *History of Chinese Culture*: "Confucius is the center of Chinese culture. Without Confucius, there would be no Chinese culture. The culture of the millennia before Confucius was preserved through him; the culture of the millennia after Confucius was initiated through him." The Great Harmony Society (Datong Society) that Confucius pursued represents the ideological realm of typical high-dimensional life. [The Great Harmony Society, where all people are one and share a single identity, is a society of one individual. The awakening of such precise and detailed high-dimensional life consciousness in the Spring and Autumn Period was remarkably visionary.]() Compared to Plato’s *Republic* on the other side of the Eurasian continent during the Axial Age, the human behavioral norms described in Confucius’s *Analects* appear more detailed, concrete, and practical.  

Though Confucius exerted enormous influence, to trace the origins of Confucianism, we must go back to the Western Zhou Dynasty. The term "Confucianism" did not exist during the Western Zhou, as Confucianism advocated a full restoration of all Western Zhou institutions. By the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the lifestyle of the Western Zhou began to be abandoned, leading to the emergence of Confucianism. In Confucius’s own humble words, Confucianism introduced little substantive innovation; its doctrines largely emulated the rituals of the Zhou (Zhouli) established by the Duke of Zhou, encapsulated in the concept of "restoring rituals to achieve benevolence" (fuli weiren). Hence, Confucius stated that he "transmitted without innovating" (shu er bu zuo). Since the Five Classics had been passed down from the Zhou Dynasty, he did not need to compose new texts; his role was to compile and transmit them. Confucius spent his life advocating adherence to Zhou institutions, which were formulated by the Duke of Zhou. For this reason, Confucius repeatedly cited the Duke of Zhou as his idol and often mentioned dreaming of him. Thus, the true founder of Confucianism was the Duke of Zhou, with Confucius serving as its inheritor and propagator.  

Confucius indeed possessed profound understanding of the Zhou rituals. [He was able to distill core philosophies from the elaborate and ritualistic Zhouli, eliminating the superficial to retain the essential, with his own unique insights and extensions of thought—an extraordinary achievement. The Confucian doctrine represented by Confucius contains the great wisdom required for human dimensional ascension and will continue to play a significant role in humanity’s future.]() Although the Qin state had not yet launched its war of unification during Confucius’s lifetime, the trends of the Zhou-Qin Transformation were already evident. In *The Analects*, Confucius expressed deep sorrow over nascent issues such as "glib speech and affected manner" (qiaoyan lingshe), "declining morality" (renxin bugu), "collapse of rituals and music" (libeng yuehuai), and "deteriorating social customs" (shifeng rixia). Over two millennia ago, Confucius already perceived the evolutionary crisis facing humanity. In this sense, he was indeed a prophet. He understood that certain instincts—whether between individuals or groups—were of vital importance, and he grasped the principle that "first incompetence, then super-ability" (first incompetence, then super-ability). By his time, an increasing number of people were beginning to "excel" in ways others could not; some states began to breach ritual norms and act in ways others dared not. This marked the beginning of a series of tragedies. Though Confucius spent his life trying to stem the tide of Adversarial Evolution, he was among the first to recognize its inevitability. [The challenges faced by Confucianism are, in essence, the dual pressures exerted by Hypocrisyism and Group Grabbingism on the genetic strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, rendering its progress arduous.]()

### Deficiencies of Confucian Doctrine  
Though Confucianism originates from the genetic strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, it has limitations and has been distorted and alienated to varying degrees over time.  

#### Lack of Rigorous Logic  
While the Confucian spirit is highly compelling and resonates with the masses, a critical flaw lies in the lack of rigorous logical reasoning in Confucian doctrine. Confucius extolled "benevolence" (ren), praised the "Zhou rituals," called for "reviving the past," and aspired to return to the "governance of the Three Dynasties" (Xia, Shang, Zhou), yet he failed to clearly articulate *why*. This lack of logical rigor and systematicity was a major methodological shortcoming of early Confucianism, directly influencing the thinking of later Confucian scholars. Though later scholars thoroughly studied the classics of Confucius and Mencius, they struggled to grasp the essence of his spirit. Most inherited Confucius’s teachings but did not understand the fundamental starting points or reasoning processes of Confucianism, resorting instead to interpreting Confucius and Confucianism based on their own understandings. This led to a tendency to cite Confucius and Mencius in every discourse—since other scholars held similar credentials and no single voice carried authority, constant references to Confucius and Mencius became necessary. This also engendered an intellectual constraint of revering the past—new ideas lacked grounding and logic, thus failing to convince. As a result, Confucianism saw little development (and often suffered distortion) over the two millennia following the Zhou rituals and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Confucianism essentially lost the opportunity to evolve with the times.  

In that era, the theory of evolution had not yet taken shape, let alone the principles of Adversarial Evolution. Thus, Confucian doctrine was more a distillation and summary of humanity’s inherent goodness. Hence, Mencius stated: "Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not infused into us from without; we inherently possess them. We simply fail to reflect upon them." This implies that these virtues are intrinsic. However, a fatal flaw exists here: while everyone has inherent sentiments, these sentiments are not necessarily limited to benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Greed, anger, and delusion—traits of Grabbingism—are also clearly part of human nature. Thus, everyone has room to interpret the Confucian spirit according to their own understanding.  

What, then, is the essence of Confucianism? As mentioned in the first volume’s chapter on "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism," this doctrine essentially refers to the "noble person" (junzi) in Confucianism. [The core spirit of Confucianism arises from Adversarial Evolution; it is the core spirit that humans have used to consolidate cooperative relationships, significantly enhance group inclusive fitness, and ultimately been fixed by natural selection.]() [The Five Constant Virtues (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trustworthiness) are moral norms evolved from Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism (the Three Cardinal Guides are not valid, as I will discuss later); rituals and music are mechanisms to mitigate issues arising from non-absolute equality due to division of labor.]() In fact, the origin of the Confucian spirit is the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism spirit that evolved as humanity achieved success. Because this spirit is a product of natural evolution and emotions inscribed in human genes, [Confucianism has enjoyed a large following in most eras, as people easily resonate directly with its spirit—a fundamental reason for its enduring appeal.]() However, Confucius and subsequent Confucian scholars could not clarify this point, nor provide a precise definition of the Confucian spirit, leaving room for later distortions of Confucian thought. For example, Dong Zhongshu later reworked and distorted Confucian theory, which was further twisted by those seeking to pander to emperors and maintain feudal rule. By later periods, the Confucian spirit had become unrecognizable. A similar process of distortion occurred when Confucianism was transmitted to Japan, where it even became an accomplice to fascism and militarism.  

#### Distorted Morality—The Degeneration of Confucian Doctrine  

##### The Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues  
Next, let us examine the transformations Dong Zhongshu introduced to Confucianism. Dong first proposed the Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues. He argued that in human relationships, sovereign-minister, father-son, and husband-wife relations are governed by fixed, eternal hierarchical principles: sovereign as master, minister as subordinate; father as master, son as subordinate; husband as master, wife as subordinate—hence the "Three Cardinal Guides: sovereign guides minister, father guides son, husband guides wife." Though this claim finds some basis in Confucianism, its essence is more akin to Legalist thought. Han Feizi stated: "When ministers serve sovereigns, sons serve fathers, and wives serve husbands, order prevails under heaven; when these are reversed, chaos ensues." This implies that ministers, sons, and wives must submit unconditionally to sovereigns, fathers, and husbands—an idea diametrically opposed to the Confucian thought of the Confucius and Mencius era. Confucianism emphasized [correspondence of rights and responsibilities](). The phrase "sovereign acts as sovereign, minister as minister; father as father, son as son" (jun jun chen chen fu fu zi zi) means that a sovereign must first act as a proper sovereign for a minister to act as a proper minister; a father must first act as a proper father for a son to act as a proper son. Thus, both "sovereign employing minister" and "minister serving sovereign" must adhere to "ritual" (li). [This reflects a principle of mutual reciprocity.]()  

Regarding the famous "Revolutions of Tang and Wu" (the overthrow of the Xia and Shang dynasties by Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou), the *Yi Zhuan* (Commentary on the *Book of Changes*) records the Confucian view (possibly Confucius’s own): "The revolutions of Tang and Wu conformed to Heaven and responded to the people; the significance of revolution in its time is great." Mencius was even more direct: "If a sovereign treats his ministers like dirt, the ministers will treat the sovereign like a bandit." That is, if a sovereign does not respect his subjects, the subjects may regard him as an enemy. His assertion that "the people are the most important, the state comes next, and the sovereign is the least important" (min wei gui, sheji ci zhi, jun wei qing) was particularly reviled by later emperors like Zhu Yuanzhang.

Therefore, the "Three Cardinal Guides" expounded by Dong Zhongshu are clearly an overgeneralization and involve conceptual substitution, deviating from the core spirit of Confucianism.  

##### Heaven-Human Interaction  
Dong Zhongshu continued to reshape Confucianism. On one hand, he retained the Confucian theory of using heavenly mandate to admonish rulers, and developed a system of divinatory and apocryphal learning that mixed mysticism with philosophy. When earthquakes or natural disasters occurred, the emperor was expected to reflect—had he acted improperly, displeasing Heaven? He would then bathe, change into ceremonial robes, and engage in introspection. Thus, emperors were compelled to respect the heavenly mandate, a concept partially inherited from the Zhou Dynasty’s belief in Tianming (Heavenly Mandate). Dong Zhongshu’s theory of "Heaven-Human Interaction" was rooted in sociopolitical concerns. He interpreted natural phenomena recorded in *The Spring and Autumn Annals* as indicators of societal and political decay. He argued that rulers should govern by "emulating Heaven" and practicing "virtuous governance" that benefits the people; otherwise, Heaven would send "calamities" to reproach the ruler. If the ruler remained unrepentant, Heaven would withdraw its mandate, leading to the loss of the realm.  

In 135 BCE (the 6th year of Emperor Wu of Han’s Jianyuan reign), fires broke out at the Gao Garden Hall of the Long Mausoleum (where imperial ancestors were worshipped) and the Gao Temple in Liaodong. Sensing an opportunity to propagate his Heaven-Human Interaction theory, Dong Zhongshu, despite illness, drafted a memorial linking the fires to Heaven’s wrath toward Emperor Wu. Before the memorial was submitted, however, Zhu Fuyan, a visitor to Dong’s residence who envied his talent, stole the draft and presented it to Emperor Wu. Enraged, Emperor Wu decreed Dong’s execution, but later relented out of appreciation for his intellect, commuting the sentence. Dong was dismissed from his post as Minister to the Prince of Jiangdu, and thereafter refrained from discussing disasters as heavenly signs, focusing instead on teaching *The Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* for a decade. We can empathize with Dong’s predicament: if Confucianism failed to appeal to the emperor, Emperor Wu might have followed in Qin Shi Huang’s footsteps with another "burning of books and burying of scholars." After all, centralized imperial power in that era was fearsome. [Dong seems to have adopted a roundabout strategy, yet he remained unfulfilled throughout his life. Perhaps he genuinely believed that the Zhou concept of Tianming and Heaven-Human Interaction could still exert a modicum of restraint over rulers.] In the end, we must acknowledge that Legalism masquerading as Confucianism helped preserve more of Confucian spirit, particularly among the common people.  

##### The Excessive Emphasis on Filial Piety  
The overemphasis on filial piety (xiao) is another distortion of Confucian thought, paralleling the warping of Confucianism in Japan. During the era of Confucius and Mencius, filial piety did not hold such preeminent status; neither the "Four Constant Virtues" nor the "Five Constant Virtues" prioritized it. For Kongzi and Mengzi, filial piety was grounded in ren (benevolence). This shifted gradually after the Han Dynasty. Consider these well-known maxims: [“Filial piety is the first of all virtues; govern the world through filial piety; loyal ministers must come from families of filial piety.”] The *Classic of Filial Piety* (Xiaojing), compiled by Zengzi, a disciple of Confucius, became a foundational text on filial piety. Later included in the Thirteen Classics, it served as a required subject in imperial examinations and official training, elevating filial piety from a familial virtue to a philosophical and political ideal propagated across society, thereby shaping social norms.  

Emperors promoted filial piety primarily because it shared roots with loyalty (zhong), a powerful tool for maintaining their rule. After the Han Dynasty, stories like the "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" spread widely among the people, fostering a "filial piety culture" that influenced ancient political and social life. The apex of "governance through filial piety" occurred during the Jin Dynasty (both Western and Eastern Jin). Upholding this principle, Jin rulers took concrete measures. In 268 CE (the 4th year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s Taishi reign), the emperor decreed: "Scholars and commoners who are diligent in learning, steadfast in the Way, filial, fraternal, loyal, trustworthy, pure, and exemplary shall be recommended for office; those who are unfilial to parents, unfraternal to kin, violate rites, abandon norms, or defy laws shall be investigated and punished." This policy promoted filial individuals to officialdom and harshly penalized the unfilial. To disseminate this governance philosophy, emperors of the Eastern Jin, including Emperor Mu, personally lectured on the *Classic of Filial Piety*. Emperor Xiaowu of Jin, as recorded in *The Biographies of Che Yin*, even held a public lecture where high-ranking officials such as Xie An (Chief Minister) and Lu Na (Minister of the Secretariat) served as attendants, while Che Yin and Wang Hun (Governor of Danyang) annotated the text—a ceremony celebrated by contemporary scholars.  

A critical measure during the Jin Dynasty was the "local moral judgment" (xiangyi qingyi) enforced by zhongzheng (local evaluators). Before entering officialdom, scholars had to pass evaluation by zhongzheng; a stain of unfilial piety disqualified them. This system was the institutional backbone of Jin’s filial governance. *The Biographies of Filial and Friendly Individuals* in the *Book of Jin* records 14 paragons of filial piety, with 55 more described as "eminently filial" or "renowned for filial piety during mourning." These accounts create the impression that the Jin Dynasty abounded with filial individuals—one could attain office through filial piety alone, regardless of ability or learning. Li Mi, author of "A Memorial of Gratitude," moved countless scholars with his profound filial devotion, compelling Emperor Wu of Jin to press him into service; Wu Yinzhi, famous for "tasting the Greed Spring and remaining uncorrupted," was also a paragon of filial piety, subsisting on pickles during mourning and later abandoning even pickles for their "excessive delicacy"; Wang Xiang, who "lay on ice to catch carp for his stepmother," so moved his contemporaries that he rose to the rank of三公, yet left little administrative legacy. [Once filial piety became the core moral norm, the easiest way to discredit someone was to label them "unfilial."] In the Wei Dynasty, Kong Rong and Ji Kang were executed on charges of "unfilial piety"; later, Zhang Juzheng’s "Dispute Over Observing Mourning" (duoqing fengbo) was essentially a political struggle framed around filial piety. Countless individuals, compelled to "fulfill filial duties," wasted their most creative years in performative acts of piety, or missed critical opportunities, becoming victims of power struggles.  

Lu Xun astutely observed: ["The Jin Dynasty governed through filial piety because its emperors came to power through usurpation (via the 'abdication' ritual). If they promoted loyalty as the core virtue, their legitimacy would be shaky, their governance hindered, and their arguments weak. Hence, filial piety was indispensable."]  

From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, how do we view filial piety? First, we must recognize that filial piety, too, emerged through Adversarial Evolution as a product of natural selection. What is its underlying logic? Humans, unlike most animals, experience menopause—a peculiar phenomenon. For most species, post-reproductive longevity is evolutionarily disadvantageous: limited resources make non-reproductive individuals a burden, leading to their eventual elimination. Thus, most species die shortly after their reproductive phase. Humans, however, live long after menopause. Why? This is closely tied to human social cooperation. As previously discussed, humans evolved language to facilitate cooperation, enabling the transmission of knowledge and experience. Within a group, the elderly live the longest and possess the most accumulated wisdom—knowledge critical to survival, such as identifying poisonous plants, avoiding predators, or predicting weather patterns. Beyond knowledge, the elderly also understand the character of every group member, a foundation for upholding Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism and enforcing rewards for virtue and punishments for vice. Younger members rely on the elderly to quickly assess the moral inclinations of others.  

Orcas, one of the few animals with social structures analogous to humans, also experience menopause. Female orcas reproduce between 12 and 40 years but live up to 90. The pod’s leader is often an elderly female. [Given the elderly’s vital role in the survival of the group, and their physical frailty, agrarian civilizations naturally evolved profound respect and filial devotion toward the elderly—sentiments deeper than ordinary mutual aid among peers.]  

Yet compared to ren (benevolence), yi (righteousness), li (propriety), zhi (wisdom), and xin (integrity)—and especially compared to justice—filial piety must take a secondary role. A respected elder should first contribute positively to upholding the group’s justice and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism. Filial piety toward elders who act counter to this is not an evolutionary trend.  

Some may argue that filial piety stems from gratitude. This is true, and such sentiment is also a product of evolution. However, we must reflect deeper: what is the best way to repay our elders? Is it to harm ourselves or future generations in their memory? No. The greatest tribute to them is to live well, to ensure the healthy functioning of human society—this aligns with the evolutionary imperative that kind elders intuitively embrace. If they knew their descendants wasted three years in mourning or imperiled the nation in their memory, they would feel no joy. The philanthropist Tian Jiabing, known as "Father of a Hundred Schools in China," dedicated his life to charity, inspired by his father’s words: ["To do more good for the country and our nation is the highest form of filial piety."]  

#### Excessive Emphasis on Promoting Virtue, Inadequate Focus on Punishing Evil

Another major deficiency of Confucianism lies in its excessive emphasis on upholding virtue while lacking adequate focus on punishing evil. In this regard, Confucianism is actually less straightforward than Legalism. The Five Constant Virtues of Confucianism—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness—represent its core tenets. Yet apart from the "discernment of right and wrong" encompassed by wisdom, we see no explicit principles for deterring vice and punishing wrongdoing. Confucianism lacks a profound understanding of the necessity of punishing evil—a practice that serves as the most effective means of upholding virtue. Its overemphasis on the "innate goodness of human nature" (particularly as espoused by Mencius) fails to proactively address the innate evil in human nature. Unilaterally advocating for benevolent governance and altruism violates the laws of evolution, and this flaw has consistently prevented Confucianism from truly becoming the driving force behind the creation of historical progress in Chinese civilization. This is precisely where Legalism fared relatively better—a positive factor contributing to its partial success and a reason many have come to admire Legalism. Of course, this is also related to the ruling class selectively distorting Confucianism to suit their interests. The ruling class, often representing the very evil that should be punished, promoted a one-sided version of Confucianism that emphasized only altruism and loyalty to the sovereign. [Confucian scholars, in turn, had to suppress their true views to gain the approval and patronage of the ruling class, a compromise necessitated by Confucianism's dependence on power.]()  

##### The Paradox of Persuading Toward Virtue  
Confucian culture has long upheld a tradition of "persuading toward virtue," and it is essential to analyze the flaws in this approach from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution. Confucianism tirelessly exhorts people to be noble gentlemen rather than petty individuals, with the reasoning that gentlemen lead better lives than petty individuals. For example, *The Analects·Shuer* states: "A noble man is open and at ease; a petty man is full of worries." However, readers who have perused the first volume of this book will by now understand [that under Adversarial Evolution, gentlemen feel anxious when committing grabbing acts (i.e., wrongdoing), whereas petty individuals feel at ease when engaging in such acts.]() In other words, petty individuals have lost the "capacity" to feel anxious about wrongdoing. Another example is from *The Analects·Yanyuan*: "The virtue of a noble man is like the wind; the virtue of a petty man is like grass. When the wind blows over the grass, the grass bends." This implies that the virtue of gentlemen will inevitably overshadow that of petty individuals. Yet in reality, petty individuals consistently gain tangible benefits, while gentlemen, constrained by their moral "principles," endure great hardship. Romain Rolland once observed: "Those who belong to the people die for the ideal of patriotism, sacrificing themselves. Yet those who send them to their deaths live for their own interests. In the end, interests outlive ideals." Such exhortations only serve to intimidate gentlemen, compelling them to impose stricter self-discipline, while petty individuals continue their grabbing pursuits. Setting aside the low likelihood of changing human nature through mere self-discipline, even if individuals could truly alter their nature, if grabbing acts remain unpunished and the fitness of grabbers does not decline, [the result will be the elimination not only of naturally virtuous individuals but also of those who cultivate virtue through self-discipline. Both the inherently virtuous and those who attain virtue through introspection and self-cultivation will be weeded out! This dual loss is extremely severe. What remains are people who have lost the capacity for introspection, and even reason. A national character marked by obstinacy, refusal to admit fault, and intransigence is thus selected for. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)—a seemingly pathological, twisted, contradictory yet disturbingly prevalent personality type—is likely also a product of this selection process.]() The remaining population increasingly consists of hypocrites, a result that is truly alarming. This reflects a short-sighted, expedient approach to upholding virtue, a process that has persisted for millennia. Both Confucianism and the religions we will discuss later [have violated the laws of Adversarial Evolution, committing strikingly similar errors.]() Conversely, if we never taught anyone the distinction between virtue and evil, never exhorted anyone toward goodness, and simply let everyone act authentically while rigorously rewarding virtue and punishing evil, the evolutionary trajectory would align more closely with our expectations.  

##### Confucian Dogma in Governance: The Experiment of Wang Mang  
Due to its inadequate understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of "evil" (Grabbingism) and the importance of the "Virtue Selection" mechanism, Confucianism, even when given the opportunity to implement its ideal "benevolent governance," often achieved outcomes contrary to its intentions. After all, the Rites of Zhou, which Confucians idealized, were merely institutional concepts lacking sufficient practical validation. The absence of a solid theoretical foundation made it difficult for Confucian practitioners to distinguish精华 from dross; uncritically adopting all aspects proved ineffective in addressing complex real-world issues. Although Confucians rarely held political power, Wang Mang's Reform can be seen as such a Confucian political experiment.  

Wang Mang, a member of the Wang consort clan, was not a traditional dissolute noble. His father, Wang Man, died early, leaving him without an inherited title. Among the Wang family's younger generation, Wang Mang initially stood out for his poverty and isolation. What propelled him to prominence within the family was his Confucian erudition and moral character. *The Book of Han* records that he treated others with humility, lived frugally, studied Confucian classics under Chen Can of Pei Commandery with unwavering diligence, and dressed like an ordinary scholar. His conduct toward family and friends perfectly aligned with traditional Confucian moral standards: he cared for his mother and widowed sister-in-law with filial piety, raised his orphaned nephew with paternal kindness, and generously supported teachers and friends with fraternal affection. This gradually drew the attention of senior Wang family members, who began to channel resources toward him. When his uncle, Grand General Wang Feng, fell ill, Wang Mang attended to him with such devotion—tasting medicine himself, neglecting his appearance, and sleeping in his clothes for months—that Wang Feng, on his deathbed, personally recommended Wang Mang to Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun and Emperor Cheng of Han. Wang Mang was thus appointed as a Huangmen Lang (Yellow Gate Gentleman), embarking on his political career.  

In the political arena, Wang Mang continued to be renowned for his moral character. *The Book of Han* describes him as "self-disciplined and tireless," rigorously curbing his desires and working unceasingly. He employed numerous virtuous scholars as subordinates, using imperial rewards and fief revenues to host literati, while living even more frugally himself. When his mother fell ill, the wives of nobles and ministers who came to inquire mistook Wang Mang's plainly dressed wife for a servant. His reputation soared within Confucian circles, leading to his appointment as Grand Marshal on two separate occasions by court officials. In the first year of the Yuanshi era (1 CE), he was further enfeoffed as "Duke Anhan."  

In response to imperial封赏, Wang Mang often stated, "Many common people still lack adequate food and clothing," and once donated one million coins and thirty hectares of land to the Grand Minister of Agriculture for relief efforts, prompting nobles and ministers to follow suit. When Emperor Ping of Han betrothed his daughter to Wang Mang, Wang Mang gave 33 million of the 40 million *li* (bride price) to eleven families providing dowry companions. Officials like Chen Chong and scholar Zhang Song then drafted memorials extolling Wang Mang, who, despite his powerful consort lineage, "embraced benevolence with humility, practiced propriety with self-restraint, defied common conventions, and stood steadfast; he wore coarse clothing, ate simple meals, rode shabby carriages with inferior horses, remained devoted to his spouse, and within his household, his filial and fraternal virtues were widely known; he lived in quiet adherence to the Way, was gentle and respectful to scholars, kind to old associates, and loyal to teachers and friends." Citing classics such as the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, they praised his merits and called for additional honors.  

This pattern became routine. When Wang Mang refused the fief of Xinyie County, over 487,572 officials and commoners petitioned the throne in his support. Nobles, dukes, marquises, and imperial clansmen, when summoned, all kowtowed, urging immediate additional enfeoffment. Wang Mang's titles thus multiplied: in 4 CE, he was granted the special title "Zaiheng" (Steward and Chancellor), a rank above all nobles; in 5 CE, he served as Regent Emperor for the two-year-old Prince Ying; and in 9 CE, having reached the pinnacle of enfeoffment, he accepted the throne through abdication, establishing the Xin Dynasty.  

His New Policies included nationalizing land owned by large landowners and redistributing it to commoners, as well as bringing salt and iron industries—long monopolized by aristocratic families—under state control. These policies reflected concern for the lower classes and sought to improve their welfare. However, Wang Mang was overly ambitious and hasty, particularly in his four currency reforms, which caused inflation. Constant warfare with the Xiongnu further plunged the populace into hardship. Without increasing the total social economic output, these policies remained empty promises, bringing no benefit to commoners and instead dragging them into deeper suffering. At times, Wang Mang contradicted himself: to win over intellectuals, he increased taxes on farmers. Having once raised high hopes among the lower classes, his overambition and ineffectiveness left them deeply disillusioned. This discontent erupted into violent retribution, culminating in his gruesome death.  

Wang Mang's reforms also included progressive measures, such as abolishing slavery, inventing the vernier caliper, and sponsoring flight experiments, but these bore a Quixotic quality. Resolving evolutionary social issues requires more than superficial understanding and dogmatism; it demands profound, essential theoretical guidance, the ability to integrate knowledge with practice, and adaptability.

Wang Mang is a uniquely complex figure. Due to the scarcity of historical records, it is difficult to render an exact evaluation of him. Contemplating his deeds evokes a sense of reverence—reverence for the common people and scholar-officials of his era who rallied behind Confucianism like modern-day Don Quixotes. Yet it was precisely this trust that later led to profound disillusionment. On the whole, Wang Mang appears more akin to an extreme Confucian dogmatist. He likely held unwavering faith in Confucianism and the Rites of Zhou, adopting them wholesale, while also harboring idealism and personal ambition. His practical capabilities, however, proved insufficient to sustain his lofty ideals. In the end, he alienated all social classes without delivering substantial benefits to any. The mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism is ultimately measured by its ability to generate cooperative dividends, whereas dogmatism, which merely preserves superficial forms, cannot create history.  

By contrast, the nascent phase of Western civilization—Roman civilization—embodied a distinct moral outlook. It placed greater emphasis on punishing evil, as exemplified by the origin of the term "fasces," derived from the rod used by Roman consular guards to mete out punishment to wrongdoers. [This slight divergence, in fact, significantly shaped the vastly different historical trajectories of the East and West.]() Later, Christianity infused Western civilization with values of benevolence and mutual aid—benevolence, mutual aid, and the punishment of evil—thereby establishing a virtuous cycle of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Yet this divergence is not attributable to any inherent flaw; from an evolutionary perspective, deeper causes underlie it, which will be explored later. These causes led Asian civilizations to prematurely enter autocratic centralized systems, where the concept of punishing evil—tantamount to autocratic rulers "reforming themselves"—lacked fertile ground for development. [Thus, despite Confucianism being exalted in China for millennia, it has remained trapped in a paradox: people take pride in reciting Confucian classics, yet those who truly grasp their essence and apply them are marginalized.]() People grow accustomed to praising the emperor’s new clothes, to echoing the powerful’s absurdities of calling a deer a horse, while those who speak the truth are scorned.  

### Failure to Establish the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism  

China is a prematurely mature civilization. By the Western Zhou period, its population had grown to considerable size. Conflicts between human groups intensified, placing society under immense strain. The individual-level Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism encoded in human genes proved inadequate to address these challenges. Confucianism (embodied in the Rites of Zhou) sought to elevate individual virtue selection to the group level, aiming to forge a five-dimensional life form. This was undeniably a momentous experiment in human history, yet due to the limitations of the era, humanity lacked the awareness and capacity to create and sustain this five-dimensional life form. Ultimately, this experiment was fated to end in the "collapse of rites and music," as detailed in the first volume of this work. Two millennia later, even in the 21st century, the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism has yet to be truly established on Earth.

### Adversarial Evolutionary Virtue  

In summary, the moral framework constructed by Confucianism was later distorted by Dong Zhongshu’s interpretations, the ethics of filial piety, and the Neo-Confucianism of the Cheng-Zhu school, compounded by its inherent lack of logical rigor. This culminated in the New Culture Movement’s call to "smash the Confucian shop." [This is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that, drawing upon the theory of Adversarial Evolution, we may one day re-examine the essence of Confucianism and the spirit of the Rites of Zhou. This intellectual legacy, which offers profound guidance for humanity’s future development, is not only a treasure of human thought but also of the Chinese nation. Its brilliance rivals any mathematical, physical, or technological innovation.]()  

In this text, to distinguish between the traditional, potentially distorted moral outlook and the moral framework derived from the mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, I refer to the latter as the "morality of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism within the framework of Adversarial Evolution," or "Adversarial Evolutionary Virtue" for short. As introduced in the first volume, Adversarial Evolutionary Virtue encompasses at least the following: loving virtue, cooperating and aiding other virtuous individuals, abhorring evil, curbing vice, and pursuing individual creative capacity. Notably, "virtue" here is a recursive concept—virtuous individuals love virtue. Moreover, loving virtue necessarily includes self-love and self-responsibility; virtuous individuals should not lightly sacrifice themselves, as their own legacy and influence are equally significant. [In this book, the term "morality" primarily refers to Adversarial Evolutionary Virtue rather than traditional intuitive morality. For general morality, I use "traditional morality," and for moral judgments rooted in human instinct, I use "intuitive morality." To clarify distinctions, I may directly employ "Adversarial Evolutionary Virtue."]()  

## The Dual Nature of Legalism  

Confucianism and Legalism are intriguing counterparts. In many respects, Legalism is the antithesis of Confucianism. If the core of Confucianism is mutual cooperation, the core of Legalism is adversarial resource-grabbing. While Legalism addressed certain deficiencies of Confucianism and displayed advantages, it also led to prolonged stagnation and human suffering. Legalism remains a contentious school of thought, yet much of this contention stems from one-sided understandings of its tenets. Some equate Legalism with modern "rule of law," which is a misrepresentation. While Legalism does emphasize legal governance, it encompasses broader theories. Thus, like Confucianism, Legalism must be analyzed from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution to discern its dual nature.  

### The Advantages of Legalism  

First, let us examine Legalism’s progressive aspects. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Biography of Lord Shang* describes the most famous Legalist reform—Shang Yang’s Reform—stating that "after ten years of implementation, the people of Qin rejoiced. Roads were free of lost items, mountains had no bandits, and households were self-sufficient. The people were valiant in public battles but timid in private quarrels; villages and towns were well-governed." Legalist reforms initially proved highly effective. The reasons for this success are as follows:  

#### Rewarding Merit and Punishing Idleness: Clear and Just Rewards and Punishments  

Legalism’s most prominent strength lies in its strict system of rewarding merit and punishing idleness, characterized by relative fairness and impartiality. Except for the emperor, most individuals fell under legal jurisdiction—even nobles in the case of Qin under Shang Yang’s reforms. For instance, when the crown prince violated the law during Shang Yang’s tenure, though the prince was young, Shang Yang punished his two tutors: Gongzi Qian was severely penalized, and Gongsun Jia was branded. Four years later, when Gongzi Qian again violated the new laws, Shang Yang imposed a more severe punishment, cutting off his nose. Han Fei also emphasized that "the law does not fawn on the noble," advocating "punishing transgressions without sparing ministers, and rewarding virtue without neglecting commoners." [We recognize that rewarding virtue and punishing evil constitutes the core mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, rendering Legalism, in this regard, more progressive than Confucianism.]() Of course, whether the laws actually reward virtue and punish evil requires critical scrutiny.  

Han Fei’s Legalist thought also drew from Daoism, with its highest ideal being "the ruler does nothing, while the law does everything." It held that with law in effect, the ruler need not worry; ministers need not toil; the people simply obey, and the world is governed through the inaction of all. Its core idea is to guide the direction of Adversarial Evolution through human selection mechanisms, a concept cognate with market economics and an advanced thought for its time.  

#### Breaking Class Barriers  

Legalism also partially dismantled ancient class barriers, thereby unleashing productive potential across social strata and boosting societal productivity. Legalists like Wu Qi and Shang Yang revitalized long-entrenched noble factions, reshuffled vested interests, disrupted old orders, established new ones, and provided upward mobility for the lower classes. By offering fairer opportunities to commoners, Legalism invigorated social dynamics and enhanced group cooperation.  

#### Emphasizing Credibility  

Legalism also stressed credibility (though Confucianism did as well, Legalism emphasized it more pragmatically). The classic example of "moving a log to establish trust" illustrates the legal spirit it represented—grounded in a system of trust. Only by establishing legal credibility could the people be incentivized to act in the group’s interest under legal guidance.  

The most influential of these reforms, Shang Yang’s, enabled Qin to dominate the Central Plains. Let us examine specific laws he enacted: "Whoever captures one enemy’s head shall be granted one rank of nobility, one qing (approximately 6.67 hectares) of farmland, nine mu (approximately 0.6 hectares) of residential land, and one commoner to serve their household." (Excerpted from *The Book of Lord Shang*) Bringing an enemy’s head guaranteed rewards: rank, land, property, and a laborer. Legalism was uncompromising in its promises—quid pro quo. Killing more enemies led to rapid advancement and wealth. With military ranks as incentives and harsh laws as deterrents, the people of Qin, with no other options, became "valiant in public battles," as historical records note: "The people rejoiced at the news of war," for it meant opportunities for promotion and riches. Society descended into a war fever: "The people viewed war as a starving wolf views meat." Though Qin’s state structure was culturally backward and politically brutal, it was militarily effective. The entire nation acted in unison, with strict discipline and unwavering obedience. At the king’s command, it surged forth like a beast, earning the moniker "the state of tigers and wolves."  

#### Pseudo-High-Dimensional State: An Intermediate Phase in Ascension

The Dimension Ascension of humanity from the 3rd to the 4th dimension is not only driven by historical impetus but also aligns with the fundamental evolutionary laws of Earth's life over billions of years. However, each dimensional ascension faces resistance from the instincts of the previous dimension. Fully shedding the instincts of the prior dimension often requires a prolonged process. Under the survival pressures of inter-group competition, life is frequently compelled to enter a temporary "pseudo-high-dimensional" state first. In this state, communities drastically enhance internal cooperation through unstable, immature, disharmonious, and even highly deleterious means to secure group survival. This, in essence, is the nature of Legalism. Its significance is akin to the roles of religion and market economy for humanity.  

First, Legalism embodies practical effectiveness and wisdom. Most states that have governed using Legalist thought have achieved varying degrees of success. Second, Legalist ideas suit the communal life state where moral decline and Grabbingism prevail. In such a state, we cannot realistically rely on individual moral cultivation or awakening to restore a healthy Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection state. Most crucially, inter-group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection mechanisms remain undeveloped, and a nascent Hobbesian Jungle State has emerged among groups. At this juncture, Legalism naturally becomes the most effective ideological weapon to ensure state survival. This weapon is strikingly effective—producing immediate results like a stimulant—but it is also extremely dangerous. Without it, survival is nearly impossible; with it, collapse is inevitable. Those who gaze into the abyss unknowingly fall into it.  

### The Dangers of Legalism  
Having discussed some relatively advanced ideas of Legalism, we now turn to its problems and harms. Legalism is rooted in the belief in inherent human evil—or rather, it only perceives the evil side of human nature, and thus spirals further down this path, eventually losing all balance. Initially, Legalism emphasized the primacy of state interests, justifying the sacrifice of other states' interests and even some individual interests within its own state. Later, Legalism evolved to view every individual as an enemy. It developed a complete set of theories and methods to guard against and manipulate others—including one's closest kin.  

#### Han Feizi: Everyone Is Your Enemy  
Han Feizi stated, "Even a wife, who is so close, and a son, who is so dear, cannot be trusted—then there is no one else to trust." In other words, trust no one; even your spouse and children are constantly scheming against you. Consider a favored consort: do you know her thoughts? She eagerly awaits your early death, for as long as she retains your favor, her child may inherit the throne. If you live for decades more, she will grow old and lose your affection, and her child will be neglected. Wives are like this, and sons are no different. If you appoint a crown prince, do you think he will be grateful? On the contrary, he longs for your death to ascend the throne sooner. Han Feizi believed human nature to be fundamentally evil—people are selfish, greedy, and foolish. Thus, the supreme ruler should trust no one, relying instead on three principles: *Law, Tactics, and Power*. These are "governing through law, suppressing through power, and manipulating through tactics."  

##### Law, Tactics, and Power  
*Law* refers to harsh penal codes, rigorously applied to the populace. It employs rewards and punishments as levers: disobedience is severely punished, while loyalty is rewarded with high offices and wealth. *Tactics* denote political manipulation. Han Feizi wrote, "The ruler uses ministers out of calculation; ministers serve the ruler out of calculation. The relationship between ruler and minister is one of mutual calculation." He claimed that "a ruler and minister wage a hundred battles in a single day," necessitating the ruler's mastery of manipulation. *Power* refers to the intimidating atmosphere created by harsh laws, which facilitates the mobilization of societal resources to achieve the goals of enriching the state and strengthening the military.  

While Legalist thinkers indeed grasped certain essential trends in societal development, they exploited these laws through excessively expedient means. The Legalist ideology represented by Han Feizi and Shen Buhai opened a Pandora's box. Later, this Grabbingist royal power donned a hypocritical guise, employing more covert, insidious, and unscrupulous methods. This philosophy of survival later permeated bureaucratic cultures at all levels, ultimately plunging China's dynastic governance into a millennium-long nightmare. No dynasty ever achieved true long-term stability. Thus, Legalism fundamentally describes a Hobbesian Jungle State from the ruler's perspective, where everyone is an enemy to everyone else.  

#### Expedience  
Interestingly, Legalism originated from Confucian thought. Most Legalist representatives studied in the Xihe School founded by Zixia, a Confucian disciple—including Li Kui, Wu Qi, and Shang Yang. Initially, these figures sought practical theories for governance. However, upon deeper engagement with Confucianism, they found it ineffective for enriching the state and strengthening the military. In an era of mutual Grabbingism, Confucianism appeared "weak and ineffectual," prompting them to abandon it and formulate Legalist thought. Zixia may have influenced this shift, as he moved beyond "self-discipline to restore propriety" to focus on contemporary governance, developing political and historical theories that extended Confucian orthodoxy.  

Moreover, Legalist representatives often hailed from or rose to prominence in the Three Jin states (Han, Zhao, Wei)—states with weaker claims to orthodoxy. Their rulers were thus more inclined to abandon the Rites of Zhou and adopt these expedient Legalist figures. The Three Jin therefore provided fertile ground for Legalism, which later flourished even more in the state of Qin.  

Han Feizi elevated Legalist theory to its apex, integrating Shang Yang's *Law*, Shen Buhai's *Tactics*, and Shen Dao's *Power*, while blending Laozi's dialectics and naive materialism into Legalism. To understand Han Feizi's background: he was a prince of Han. By his time, Han had been transformed by Shen Buhai's Legalist reforms, shifting from a culture of integrity and moral rectitude to one of manipulation and intrigue. Furthermore, Han Feizi lived in the late Warring States period, when Qin dominated, and the six states could no longer resist. His homeland, Han, was on the frontlines—Qin would inevitably annihilate the weakest and closest state first. Thus, the expedient elements in his thought were likely a response to these urgent circumstances. The greatest irony, however, is that it was Qin Shi Huang, the most "successful" heir to Legalism, who destroyed Han and executed Han Feizi himself.

##### Militarism and Group Grabbing Behavior  
Legalist practices are profoundly expedient. For example, China's earliest militarist ideology can be traced to Qin following Shang Yang's reforms. Shang Yang declared, "The state's great undertakings are farming and warfare." He implemented laws to incentivize these activities, while suppressing culture, commerce, and even science and philosophy. Francis Fukuyama writes in *The Origins of Political Order*: "Compared to other militarized societies, Zhou-era China was exceptionally brutal." It is estimated that Qin mobilized 8%–20% of its total population for war, whereas the Roman Republic mobilized only 1%. Casualties during the late Zhou were also unprecedented: the Roman Republic lost approximately 50,000 soldiers in the Battles of Lake Trasimene and Cannae, while... Chinese figures were nearly ten times those of their Western counterparts.  

Ultimately, Legalism devolved into an excessively expedient theoretical system. To safeguard the ruler's interests, it suppressed merchants and stifled the productive and creative capacities of the people. It employed manipulation to consolidate power, treating the populace as objects of exploitation rather than partners in cooperation—all short-sighted measures. While Legalism enabled centralized authority and the rapid accumulation of temporary strength, state policies prioritized farming and warfare—early militarism. [Through military conquest, it executed Group Grabbing behavior to deflect internal contradictions.]() These practices, however, severely hindered a group's long-term progress and healthy development. Legalism is a quintessential, short-sighted Group Grabbingist ideology that plunges all surrounding groups into severe internal strife.  

##### The Tragic Fates of Leading Legalists  
Nearly all prominent Legalist figures achieved remarkable success. [Judging solely by their immediate accomplishments, Legalism could be deemed a paragon of "success studies," with a high probability of short-term success.]() Yet, from a longer historical perspective, Legalist successes proved ephemeral, and the fates of Legalist figures were profoundly tragic.  

Take Wu Qi, the famous general who reformed Chu. Wu Qi advanced his career through ruthless acts like killing his wife. Astute and calculating, he rapidly rose to power in Chu. Though his reforms in Chu brought temporary glory, his harsh methods incurred widespread resentment. Upon the death of King Dao of Chu, who supported his reforms, Wu Qi was shot dead at the king's funeral; Chu's nobles, seething with hatred, riddled his body with arrows. Wu Qi's own death was gruesome, and his wife had been killed by him as well. The *Biographies of Sunzi and Wu Qi* records: "When the Qi attacked Lu, Lu intended to appoint Wu Qi as general. Wu Qi had married a woman from Qi, so Lu doubted his loyalty." A native of Lu, Wu Qi had married a Qi woman. When Qi and Lu went to war, Lu hesitated to name him general due to his wife's nationality. Her nationality became the primary obstacle to his appointment, so Wu Qi resolutely killed his wife, using her head to secure his rise to power.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e5e28e2-d2a4-4928-bca1-62e82f173453" />  
</p>

From the process of the legal reforms in the State of Qin, it is evident that Shang Yang was an extremely uncompromising figure who treated all individuals as mere pawns in his path to success. After the reforms achieved their goals, he himself became the target of universal resentment. His avengers killed his entire family, including his elderly mother. Cornered and fleeing, Shang Yang sought shelter at an inn, only for the innkeeper to declare, “Shang Yang’s laws dictate that anyone harboring a traveler without proper documentation shall be subject to collective punishment.” Shang Yang was eventually captured and executed by being torn apart by chariots. In his interpretation of *The Book of Lord Shang*, Bao Pengshan concludes, “The result of Shang Yang’s reforms was that everyone lost.” For Shang Yang cared nothing for the people’s well-being, fixating solely on the short-term strength of the state. His most infamous innovation was the system of collective punishment—a “pioneering” act in legal history. This system prohibited fathers, sons, and brothers from cohabiting under the same roof; households with two or more able-bodied male laborers were required to split and register separately. Additionally, the entire population was organized into military-style units: five households formed a *wu* (伍), and ten households formed a *shi* (什). Unregistered relocations were banned, and all were compelled to monitor and report on one another. Failure to report transgressions would result in collective punishment for the entire ten-household unit.  

These harsh laws bound farmers tightly to the land, allowing the state to directly control the nation’s labor force and secure tax revenues. It is clear that Legalist laws were deeply shortsighted, designed merely to intimidate the populace and reduce governance costs, while entirely disregarding the profound significance of fairness and justice in the context of *Adversarial Evolution*.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1867081-286f-4026-a21c-ba6a1d96390a" />
</p>  

As for Han Fei, his writings taught that no one could be trusted, as all were sinister, self-serving, and greedy. The King of Qin (later Emperor Qin Shi Huang) embraced Han Fei’s philosophy but suspected him of being a spy, leading to Han Fei’s imprisonment. There, he was poisoned by Li Si—another Legalist figure—who envied his talent. Li Si himself met a gruesome end: he and his son were later executed by腰斩 under the orders of Zhao Gao, also a Legalist. Who, then, benefited from the Legalist system? Certainly not the people of Qin. To unify the realm, the Qin populace paid with blood and toil. After Shang Yang’s reforms, the people of Qin were either driven to the battlefield or forced into backbreaking labor in the fields under oppressive taxes and corvée labor. Many were imprisoned for violating the innumerable laws, leading to the lament, “The people of Qin are destitute, weeping together over Duke Xiao.”  

Consider now Ying Zheng, later Emperor Qin Shi Huang, an unapologetic advocate of Legalism. He revered Han Fei’s doctrines, viewing them as kindred to his own ambitions. Through relentless adherence to Legalist methods, he ultimately unified the Six States, becoming China’s first emperor of a centralized empire. He claimed his achievement of unifying the realm was “unprecedented since ancient times, surpassing even the Five Emperors.” Deeming the title “King” insufficient to reflect his greatness, he adopted the new title “Emperor.”  

To strengthen imperial control, Qin Shi Huang implemented a separation of three powers in the central government: the Chancellor (in charge of administration), the Commandant (in charge of military affairs), and the Censor-in-Chief (in charge of supervision). These roles were designed to check and balance one another. At the local level, the empire was divided into prefectures, each governed by a Prefect (civil administration), a Military Commander (military affairs, directly answerable to the center), and a Supervisor (inspection and discipline, also directly answerable to the center). These three local offices were independent, ensuring mutual oversight. Through this system, imperial authority permeated every corner of the realm, with the populace tightly controlled by a bureaucratic apparatus.  

Qin Shi Huang further pursued the Legalist policy of “weakening the people.” All private weapons—swords, lances, halberds, axes, battle-axes, hooks, and tridents—were confiscated, melted down, and cast into twelve giant metal statues in the capital of Xianyang, leaving the populace disarmed. To unify thought, he ordered the burning of all books except Qin’s official histories and practical manuals. Any remaining books found after a thirty-day deadline would result in punishment for their owners. Public discussion of the *Odes* or *Documents* was punishable by decapitation; criticizing the present by glorifying the past would lead to the execution of the offender’s entire family. This was the infamous “Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars.”  

Though Qin Shi Huang enjoyed a moment of glory, none of his descendants met a favorable end. His eldest son, Fusu, was tricked into suicide; his successor, Emperor Ershi, executed twelve of his brothers and ten sisters, driven by Legalist paranoia of mutual suspicion. Ershi himself later committed suicide. After Qin’s collapse, nearly all of the royal family was killed. The Qin Dynasty, established by Qin Shi Huang, lasted a mere fourteen years, becoming an extremely short-lived empire. In this sense, Qin Shi Huang was an unmitigated败家 son, squandering in a few short years the legacy painstakingly built by his ancestors over five or six centuries.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79699d85-46dc-4fd9-8c28-66f90c77c63c" />
</p>  

Objectively, though Qin briefly claimed the laurels of unifying China, its success was illusory. The dynasty collapsed within a decade of achieving unification, a fleeting flower that perished utterly, squandering centuries of accumulated legacy. What made its failure most profound was that, unlike many dynasties which left behind nostalgic adherents, few mourned Qin or identified as its remnants. In contrast, during the subsequent Chu-Han Contention, various former states saw their people rally to restore their old kingdoms. Take the State of Lu, a paragon of ritual propriety: though politically defunct long ago, its memory endures even today—Shandong Province still uses “Lu” as its abbreviation—testifying to a legacy of ritual and music that transcends dynastic boundaries.  

Qin’s failure not only doomed itself but inflicted profound suffering on the Chinese people. This catastrophe spurred reflection among early Han dynasty rulers, leading them to revive Huang-Lao Daoism and Confucianism. The resulting “Rule of Wen and Jing” in the early Han became a rare golden age in Chinese history, a paragon of prosperity.  

#### The Mask of Confucianism, the Core of Legalism  
Though individual Legalist figures met disgrace and ruin, Legalism endured as the bedrock of imperial governance in later Chinese dynasties. Emperor Wu of Han, in particular, bore striking resemblances to Qin Shi Huang. Euphemized as a ruler of “great talent and vision,” he was in reality ambitious and glory-seeking, building his legacy on the depletion of state resources and the excessive exploitation of the common people.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/574faa76-34d4-4b85-a0e2-231da86310b0" />
</p>  

To extract wealth from the people and weaken them, Emperor Wu devised a chain of schemes to exploit the populace. As recorded in Zhang Hongjie’s *A Concise History of China*, Emperor Wu’s first step was “selling noble titles.” He dangled tempting lures to entice wealth: though expensive, these titles exempted holders from military conscription and corvée labor. Merchants eagerly purchased them, filling the imperial coffers.  

His second step was “increasing taxes”—specifically, a property tax. He issued the “Suan Min” decree, requiring merchants to voluntarily declare their assets: houses, land, and livestock. Ostensibly lenient, as the state did not conduct inspections, this policy led to widespread evasion (“wealthy families all hid their riches”). Everyone harbored hopes of underreporting, resulting in rampant lawbreaking.  

Emperor Wu’s follow-up was the “Gao Min” decree: anyone concealing or underreporting assets could be reported to authorities. Upon verification, the offender’s entire property would be confiscated, with half awarded to the informant. This trapped nearly all merchants, who could not complain—they had only themselves to blame for trying to “take advantage of the state.” Suddenly, “informing” became a means of livelihood for the poor, enriching both the state and common people.  

But Emperor Wu expanded the policy further. Initially targeting merchants, he extended the “Gao Min” decree to all urban and rural areas, requiring everyone to pay property tax. Even the poor’s ill-gotten gains from informing were soon confiscated as others reported them. As the saying went, “Informing swept the land; households above the middle class were all targeted.” “Middle-class” households—those of moderate means—were ruined en masse.  

How much wealth did Emperor Wu amass? According to *Records of the Historian: Treatise on Food and Goods*, the court “collected wealth in the hundreds of millions and enslaved tens of millions of people.” During Emperor Wu’s reign, with a total population of approximately 40 million, a staggering 10 million became slaves due to these policies.  

The final step was even more devious. Earlier, selling titles had exempted holders from corvée labor, but this left the state short of labor for major projects. Undeterred, Emperor Wu “adjusted” his policy: lower-ranked titles were no longer exempt. Those who had purchased titles now found themselves back in forced labor, such as constructing the Shanglin Park and Kunming Pool.

Emperor Wu of Han established his unparalleled achievements precisely through such manipulative tactics directed at the common people. However, this approach was clearly a shortsighted and destructive one—draining the pond to catch all the fish, killing the hen to get the eggs—deeply characteristic of Legalism. The superficial "exclusive reverence for Confucianism" was merely a hypocritical facade, with its essence rooted in Legalist logic and methods. From this point onward, the Han Dynasty began its decline from prosperity. According to *The Book of Han*, when Emperor Yuan (then Crown Prince) observed his father, Emperor Xuan, frequently employing harsh laws and penalties, he advised: "Did our ancestors not teach us to govern by Confucian principles? How could Your Majesty forget?" Emperor Xuan flared with anger and retorted: "The Han Dynasty has its own system, inherently combining the Kingly Way and the Hegemonic Way!" This meant, "You do not understand. The secret of our Han rule lies in the integration of the Kingly Way (Confucian virtue) and the Hegemonic Way (Legalist coercion)."  

### The Confucian-Legalist Controversy  
Though Legalist figures emerged from the Confucian tradition, their political doctrines diverged drastically from Confucianism. Confucianism is grounded in the belief that human nature is inherently good, while Legalism is based on the assumption that human nature is fundamentally evil. Confucianism seeks to enhance group cooperation through moral persuasion; Legalism, by contrast, aims to impose control over the people through harsh laws, penalties, and political stratagems, leveraging advantageous power structures to enforce cooperation.  

Confucianism holds that "those with stable property will have stable minds." The middle class, possessing moderate and secure assets, is seen as a stabilizer of society—their steady circumstances prevent them from resorting to unruly behavior. Without a property base, Confucians argue, people become "those who fear no loss," prone to deviating from proper conduct. Shang Yang, however, declared: "When the people are weak, the state is strong; when the state is strong, the people are weak. Thus, a well-governed state must strive to weaken its people." In *Calculating the Land*, he elaborated: "Artisans rely on their hands; merchants rely on their wits. If all under heaven were to possess such personal resources, they would depend on external powers rather than the state. Even Yao and Shun would struggle to govern them. Hence, Tang and Wu prohibited such practices, thereby achieving merit and fame." In other words, artisans and merchants who accumulate wealth through their skills or trade become independent of state authority, making governance difficult. Only by impoverishing and weakening the people can the state command their respect and obedience.  

Confucianism asserts that "when granaries are full, people will know propriety and righteousness," but Legalism deems such moral aspirations unnecessary. Shang Yang viewed the middle class's pursuit of higher spiritual ideals as not only useless but even perilous. In the "Rewards and Punishments" chapter of *The Book of Lord Shang*, he stated: "Extensive knowledge, cleverness, rituals, music, and moral cultivation should not lead to wealth or honor." Such traits—erudition, wit, integrity, and refinement—were to be eliminated, as they made people difficult to control. For Shang Yang, impoverishing the people was the first step in ensuring their subordination to state power and policy.  

Confucianism advocates appointing virtuous scholars to govern the state. Han Fei vehemently opposed this, arguing that intelligent individuals were too unruly to command uniformly. He declared: "Confucians disrupt the law with their writings; knights-errant violate prohibitions with their martial skills." Literati, through their intellectual independence, and knights, through their defiance of authority, were seen as sources of chaos. Han Fei concluded: "Seeking sage-kings to appoint as officials is the beginning of disorder." Thus, Shang Yang maintained that expelling the virtuous and the wise was a prerequisite for governance: "Eliminating the worthy and discarding knowledge is the method of rule."  

While Confucianism emphasizes governing with moral individuals, Legalism, as outlined in *The Book of Lord Shang*, proposes "governing with wicked people": "A state that uses good people to govern wicked people will surely descend into chaos and decline; a state that uses wicked people to govern good people will surely achieve order and strength" (*Strengthening the State*). In essence, Legalists believed that ruling through unscrupulous figures would force the populace to submit to brute power, accepting unjust conditions and obeying commands. This Legalist management culture persists to this day, with many still revering such tactics as inviolable principles. However, this stifling of innovation and creativity continues to harm Chinese enterprises.  

### The Shared Flaw of Confucianism and Legalism  
Ultimately, both Confucianism and Legalism devolved into tools for consolidating monarchical power and preserving the interests of a single imperial lineage. Legalism, while once advocating for equality under the law (Shang Yang even enforced laws against nobles, and Han Fei emphasized "the law does not favor the noble"—"punishment for wrongdoing should not spare ministers, and rewards for virtue should not omit commoners"), contained a critical flaw: the emperor himself remained above the law. This problem became more acute after the unification of the realm, as imperial power escaped legal constraint.  

### The Integration of Confucianism and Legalism  
In theory, Confucianism and Legalism could complement each other—"taking Confucian benevolence and righteousness, and adopting Legalist punishment of evil"—to construct a robust institutional system. However, under the constraints of ancient imperial governance, such a balance proved unattainable. Regrettably, they merged in the opposite direction: "taking Confucian filial piety and loyalty (which could be weakening), and adopting Legalist cruelty and weakening of the people," while discarding benevolence and rendering the law ineffective against emperors and nobles. This fusion contributed to the long-term poverty and weakness of China's historical trajectory.  

We see that pre-Qin states were not lacking in moral rectitude, nor were the pre-Qin philosophers devoid of benevolence. Yet all were defeated by harsh reality—a reality where Group Grabbingism inevitably secures short-term advantages, enabling such groups to likely triumph over those practicing benevolent governance at home and abroad. This victory erases the future of "virtuous groups." Furthermore, such Group Grabbing ideologies almost invariably spread from the ruling class downward, leading to infighting among rulers and ministers, factional strife, and ultimately the collapse of the very states that adopted these strategies.  

### The Endurance of Confucian Spirituality  
To call the Chinese people "Han people" is less precise than calling them "Zhou people." For the moral standards established by the Zhou Dynasty and the spirit embodied in the *Rites of Zhou* form the most fundamental foundation of Chinese identity, a legacy carried forward by Confucianism. Confucianism, moreover, was officially revered by successive dynasties. In a sense, Dong Zhongshu succeeded in perpetuating Confucianism as a school of thought. Yet even without him, Confucianism—so aligned with humanity's instinct for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection—would have found its own space to endure. Though distorted and obscured, the core Confucian spirit could not be entirely erased, even by rulers. For example, Zhu Yuanzhang, despite his hatred for Mencius, could not truly eradicate Confucian principles. Qin Shi Huang burned books; Zhu Yuanzhang expurgated texts. But as long as the people’s nature resonates with Confucian ideals, such efforts are futile.  

The "grassroots elites" of the Chinese nation—though the term is somewhat awkward—are precisely this resilient force. They may be local gentry far from the capital, rural scholars, or reclusive sages. They adhere to a set of familial and social values closer to Confucianism. During dynastic changes, they often remain aloof or engage cautiously, but in times of national crisis, they rise to action—"Matters of state rise and fall are the concern of the nobility; matters of the world’s rise and fall are the responsibility of every commoner." Their presence was evident in movements like the "Restoration of Ming" against the Qing and during the War of Resistance against Japan.  

The Chinese nation has endured for millennia unlike the Sumerian, Egyptian, Indus, Greek, or Roman civilizations, which collapsed and never revived. The true strength of Chinese civilization lies in the highly resilient Confucian thought. What has truly been transmitted through history is not merely the Chinese people, but the Confucian philosophy and spirit—one that has assimilated countless foreign peoples, rebuilding civilization each time upon its core principles. Further exploration of China’s developmental trajectory will be undertaken in the chapter *Laws of Imperial Rise and Fall*.  

## Historical Tides of Group Grabbingism  
The collision between the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection genetic strategy and the tide of Group Grabbingism is no historical accident—it is an inevitability, a massive chasm blocking humanity’s path to dimensional ascension.  

### *The Prince* and Legalism: A Western Parallel  
Complementing Chinese Legalism is its Western counterpart: Machiavelli’s *The Prince*, which prioritizes national interest, even at the expense of the people and other nations. Both ideologies base institutional design on the assumption of human evil, hastily attempting to "out-compete" for national fortune. By amplifying human vice, they subvert the civilizational foundation of "good begets good, evil begets evil," ultimately causing the tragedy of reverse selection of virtue and evil.  

*The Prince* asserts: "He who causes others to grow powerful dooms himself; evil should be inflicted all at once, while favors should be granted gradually; when everyone can speak truth to you, they will lose their reverence for you." This mirrors Legalist doctrines of "governing through law, intimidating through power, and manipulating through stratagem." The "power" (势) refers to the terror instilled by harsh laws, which facilitates the mobilization of societal resources for enriching the state and strengthening the military. Han Fei’s more radical statement—"The ruler hoards ministers through calculation; ministers serve the ruler through calculation. The relationship between ruler and minister is one of calculation"—echoes this logic.  

*The Prince* advises either to flatter a man or to destroy him entirely: "People avenge minor wrongs, but cannot retaliate against mortal injuries. Thus, when attacking, strike so hard that you need never fear reprisal." This is a recurring drama in China’s imperial succession, now adopted as a "winning strategy" in official and corporate circles.  

Not only do *The Prince* and Legalism share philosophical affinities; their historical contexts are strikingly similar. Machiavelli wrote amid Italy’s prolonged fragmentation, foreign subjugation, and ceaseless warfare—paralleling Han Fei’s situation in the late Warring States period, where his state of Han was surrounded by powerful enemies, teetering on the brink of collapse.

Machiavelli attributed this state of affairs to the corruption of ecclesiastical power, identifying three key factors: First, the Papacy, in its bid to expand influence, deliberately interfered with and inflamed conflicts among the Italian city-states, thereby dividing and controlling their regimes through calculated manipulation. Second, the Church colluded with the nobility, exploiting the latter’s selfishness and corruption to oppose republican governance and safeguard its own political and material interests. Third, institutional flaws within the Church itself, compounded by inconsistent political stances, perpetuated chaos. With popes holding office for an average of only ten years, eradicating any faction proved nearly impossible; shifting allegiances between successive popes led to the resurgence of rival groups, leaving the nation mired in perpetual strife.  

One of the core tenets of *The Prince* posits that politics is fundamentally a theory of securing national interests. Machiavelli argued: "The purpose of politics is to preserve and augment a state’s political power, and the success or failure of this goal serves as the measure of a statesman’s achievement." He explicitly declared, "[Every individual must place their duty to the state above all other obligations and considerations.]" For a statesman, the primary concern, he maintained, was the security of the state—requiring the courage to make necessary decisions "[without regard to moral judgments, be they about justice, humanity, cruelty, honor, or disgrace.]" Small neighboring states should be protected but not strengthened; stronger ones among them should be strategically weakened.  

A second key view in *The Prince* asserts, "[The value of a state’s political system lies first and foremost in its very existence.]" Machiavelli’s famous maxim—"Tyranny is a potent political remedy, laced with poison, yet sometimes necessary"—underscores his belief that governance must align with a nation’s specific conditions. While a republic is ideal (and the only viable form) in societies with relative economic equality, tyranny becomes necessary in two exceptional cases: 1) to establish a new state; 2) to reform a corrupt one.  

The third major perspective advocates for the Roman *dictatura* (dictatorship). Machiavelli emphasized that rulers and statesmen must master the art of governance. Regarding state legislation, he advised princes: 1) A republic’s constitution must be flexible to endure. Rigidity risks self-entrapment, as changing circumstances may render the constitution obsolete, potentially leading to the state’s decline. 2) A republic must formalize the appointment of an official with absolute power to address emergencies. In daily governance, he noted, republican decision-making, constrained by the need to reconcile diverse opinions, tends to be sluggish. Thus, constitutional provisions for concentrated power during crises are essential to enable swift, effective action—even if it temporarily overrides constitutional norms. The Roman *dictatura*, he argued, epitomized this success, centralizing power and enabling Rome to achieve global dominance.  

Rooted in his view of human nature as inherently selfish and corrupt, *The Prince* advises rulers to focus solely on acquiring and maintaining political power. Even in peacetime, a strong army and mastery of warfare are imperative: "A prince should have no other aim or thought, nor study anything else, except war and its rules and discipline." Morally, a prince must not be bound by traditional ethics; practicality is paramount, for adherence to "virtue" might lead to ruin. As Machiavelli phrased it, a prince should "believe in reality, avoid fantasy," so that "one who wishes to act entirely by the book of virtues" does not "perish quickly among so many who are evil." Thus, a prince need not care if others deem him evil, cruel, or unfaithful—only that he preserves his rule. "[For good faith matters little; what matters is the ability to adapt to new circumstances, to learn cruelty, ruthlessness, deceit, and duplicity.]" To this end, a prince should emulate both the fox (to detect traps) and the lion (to intimidate wolves), as the fox alone cannot fend off wolves, and the lion alone cannot evade traps.  

In 1532, Pope Clement VII personally authorized the publication of *The Prince*, which was reprinted twenty-five times within two decades, exerting profound influence. However, backlash soon mounted: parliaments ordered its burning; in Rome, Machiavelli was branded a heretic; by 1559, *The Prince* was banned across Europe; Catholics and Protestants united in condemnation. Nevertheless, *The Prince* became a staple for rulers. Machiavelli’s theories of monarchical rule and political stratagem—"Machiavellianism"—evolved into a cornerstone of governance for subsequent ruling classes. Oliver Cromwell kept a copy of *The Prince*; Henry III and Henry IV of France carried it when assassinated; Frederick the Great of Prussia relied on it for decisions; Louis XIV read it nightly; a批注-filled French edition was found in Napoleon’s carriage after Waterloo; Bismarck, hailed as a devout disciple of Machiavellianism, mastered its tenets; Hitler kept it on his desk and bedside; Mussolini declared, "I regard *The Prince* as the highest guide for statesmen, still vital today." Undoubtedly, Machiavelli’s influence on political thought earned him recognition as "the father of political science."  

[Upon deeper analysis of Machiavelli’s theoretical framework, we uncover profound contradictions. He and his nation, he recognized, were victims of the Vatican’s and nobility’s scheming political machinations—victims of the very "Machiavellian" tactics of duplicity, ruthlessness, and deceit. Yet his advice to princes was to employ similar tactics to control their subjects. As such harm trickles downward, deficits under the *Law of Grabbing Deficit* accumulate. For scheming generates no value; an atmosphere of threat and intimidation stifles innovation. Fighting evil with evil is akin to draining a pond to catch fish—leaving nothing for the future. Though it may seem shrewd, this approach is ultimately foolish. When the final link in the chain can neither grab nor vent, the entire charade collapses swiftly.]  

### The Crisis of Classical Political Ethics  

Prior to Machiavelli, Western political thought was deeply influenced by Aristotle. *Politics*, Aristotle’s masterpiece, exemplifies ancient Greek political inquiry. In discussing political justice, Aristotle framed politics as a normative ethical enterprise—politics itself is ethics, with constitutions as its practical form. He explored how politics emerges from ethics and shapes human relations. From the outset of human reflection on self-governance, the pursuit of fairness and justice has been a constant. Plato argued that seeking justice is seeking benefit, asserting, "[Justice is order and harmony, each fulfilling their proper role.]" Aristotle, from the perspective of the *polis* (city-state), maintained that humans achieve self-sufficiency and social fulfillment within this "great family," pursuing higher political justice as a value. Centering human dignity, the *polis* environment becomes a stage for pursuing virtue and justice. Ethical principles—such as fairness, courage, wisdom, and friendship—regulate political relations and actions; constitutions operationalize these ethical goals, seeking collective security and happiness for citizens and the state.

</p>  

[This ethical constraint on politics parallels the role of the *Rites of Zhou* in regulating warfare and diplomacy among pre-Qin states. From Aristotle onward, politics was seen as subordinate to moral ethics. Machiavelli, however, argued that external factors are far more subservient to politics than political theorists imagined—in simpler terms, he believed that when a group abandons political ethical constraints, it reaps significant benefits from *Group Grabbingism*.] By severing ethics from politics, Machiavelli shattered moral boundaries, rendering *The Prince* both famous and infamous. To him, morality was a tool of politics; ends justified means, even if the latter were ignoble. His satirical play *Mandragola* (The Mandrake) illustrates this. The plot follows an old man seeking to marry a young woman to bear heirs, despite his own infertility. A young man, desiring the woman, deceives the old man, claiming she must ingest mandrake root to conceive—but first, a man must sleep with her to "draw out the poison." He enlists a friar and the woman’s mother to manipulate her into compliance.

This act, though ethically questionable, led to a mutually satisfactory outcome: the elderly man secured the continuation of his lineage, the young woman enjoyed conjugal bliss, the mother-in-law no longer worried about her daughter’s future, the deceitful libertine got his way, and the monk profited from the arrangement. The moral of the story, as the monk put it, is: “We must not forfeit good opportunities out of fear of potential misdeeds.” Yet readers of this book, cognizant of Adversarial Evolution, recognize that such an outcome cannot truly be called “mutually satisfactory.” For in this scenario, genes of hypocrisy and deception propagate more widely, severely undermining the cooperative foundations of human society.  

Machiavelli’s political thought, akin to Legalist political philosophy, is marked by expediency—for without such measures, their states would perish. Thus, his view is: first ensure the state’s survival, even through ignoble means; only by surviving can there be a chance to pursue ideals and distant aspirations. This reflects the awkward situation caused by the intense involution and internal depletion of group competition. It is no surprise that Machiavelli entertained such ideas, as they align with Legalist thought. Both belong to the ideological current of Group Grabbingism, and both are products of highly rational—though myopic—calculation. When a state faces existential crisis, survival becomes the precondition for future possibilities, making such thinking “pragmatic” in the moment. This mirrors the “queue dilemma” we discussed earlier: if cutting in line incurs no punishment, then cutting in line will inevitably be the rationally optimal choice. Even if everyone’s “optimal choice” leads to chaos, trampling, and heavy casualties, cutting in line remains the unavoidable “best” decision. Therefore, until a Group Virtue Selection Mechanism is established, human group order will remain fragile, acute conflicts between human groups will persist unresolved, and humanity’s future will be shrouded in profound uncertainty.  

### Alternative Names for Group Grabbingism  
We have discussed Legalism and *The Prince*. Let us expand: such ideologies, under varying names, have reemerged throughout history, with Group Grabbingism being “rediscovered” repeatedly—especially during eras of intense inter-state conflict. Examples include the Legalism and Machiavellianism analyzed earlier. Consider Hegel’s assertion: “The state is the absolutely rational thing in and for itself, because it is the actuality of the substantial will… This substantial unity is an absolute, unprovoked end in itself… Being a member of the state is the highest duty of the individual.” In plain terms, this means the state itself is the ultimate and supreme purpose; the state does not exist for other factors, but other factors exist for the state. On this basis, Hegel elevates the state above society and individuals, arguing that the state’s mission is self-preservation, not the protection of individual freedoms or interests: “If the state is confused with civil society, and its mission defined as securing and protecting property and individual freedom, then the interests of individuals themselves become the final purpose of their association. Consequently, membership in the state becomes optional. But the relationship of the state to the individual is entirely different. Since the state is objective spirit, the individual only attains objectivity, truth, and ethicality by becoming a member of the state.” Pushed to its extreme, this statist idea, expressed in Hegel’s characteristic metaphysical language, becomes his famous dictum: *“The march of God in the world, that is what the state is.”*  

We must acknowledge that Hegel’s statist collectivism is more advanced than individualism, as humanity has indeed thrived on the dividends of mutualistic group cooperation. Yet Hegel’s cooperative vision, at least as interpreted by later generations, seems to end at the state. Hegelian philosophy later evolved into Neo-Hegelianism. A key example is Benedetto Croce (1866–1952), a leading figure in Italian Neo-Hegelianism. Croce’s holistic philosophy posits that “above the ‘small self’ lies the ‘great self’” and “beyond the world experienced by the individual exists a suprahuman reality.” From the perspective of the “small self” (the individual), action is merely economic; from the “great self,” it is moral. Superficially, this resembles the Dimension Ascension theory discussed in this book, where individuals form a collective through cooperation, with all interests evaluated in service of this whole. We refer to such theories collectively as collectivism or extreme collectivism. These ideologies contain many advanced, correct, or nearly correct elements, and are highly seductive. Yet once they prioritize collective interests or elevate inter-state conflicts to primacy, they can scarcely avoid descending into the abyss of Group Grabbingism.  

The ultimate goal of Dimension Ascension is to form a symbiotic whole encompassing diverse, specialized individuals, where every group coexists harmoniously rather than in a zero-sum struggle. Its path is one of moderation. Moreover, Dimension Ascension emphasizes the value and role of individuals, the importance of transmitting virtuous individuals, and their long-term significance—not arbitrary sacrifice for the collective. It underscores the necessity of cooperation maintenance mechanisms such as Virtue Selection systems or immune systems. Its final aim is cooperation, not grabbing, and the long-term preservation of cooperative mechanisms.  

Neo-Hegelianism was later inherited by Mussolini, evolving into Fascism: “For Fascism, the state is absolute. Individuals and groups are only conceivable within the state.” In the eyes of Fascists, “everything exists within the state; outside the state, there is nothing human or spiritual, nor any meaning.”  

### The Dangers of Group Grabbingism  
As discussed in the previous volume, collectivist ideologies demand vigilance. Extreme and myopic collectivism easily degenerates into Group Grabbingism—whether Legalism, Machiavellianism, or Neo-Hegelianism. Often, such ideologies emerge passively, as a defense against other groups’ grabbing. Their core flaw lies in this: they carve a specific group, class, nation, or state out of the “super-group” and define it as a relatively independent small group. The original intent may be noble—to strengthen internal unity and cooperation—and their slogans, couched in positive terms, resonate and indoctrinate. Yet once this “small group” concept takes root, it readily devolves into Group Grabbingism: internally, members seek equality and resist being grabbed, so the most socially acceptable behavior becomes grabbing from outside. Regardless of whether the group is democratic or free, it cannot avoid this short-sighted trajectory—a pattern we have witnessed innumerable times in human history.  

In most cases, such group grabbing, like individual grabbing without a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection mechanism, yields short-term gains. Among terms like collectivism, corporatism, Neo-Hegelianism, statism (centrism), (narrow) nationalism, racism, and Nazism—many of which are familiar—nearly all have ultimately devolved into Group Grabbingism. To absolutely declare that “state interests are supreme” or “the interests of the masses are supreme” violates the foundational principles of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection mechanism, under which only the interests of the virtuous can be supreme. Furthermore, within this framework, the definition of “virtue” must evolve and adapt over time.  

### Caesar’s Vision  
The tension between parochial and transcendent collectivism has long been a dilemma for human society. For humanity to ascend from 3D animal to 4D collective consciousness is already extraordinary; ascending to 5D is even rarer—like the miracle of Julius Caesar during the founding of the Roman Empire. We know that both Cicero, the senator, and Caesar, the reformer, pursued justice. Cicero, a learned sage, wrote in *On Duties*: “Among all human affections, the highest and most virtuous is love of country. All know to love parents, children, siblings, friends, and spouses. Yet all these affections are contained within love of country. If the state is in peril or in need, its people must sacrifice themselves without hesitation.” This reflects profound collectivism and patriotism. As described by Yuki Sano, I suspect Caesar would have agreed—this passage could as easily be attributed to him. Yet even so, irreconcilable contradictions existed between them (at least in Cicero’s view). Their conceptions of “country” differed fundamentally. For Caesar, the “country” could encompass multiple states, nations, and races; he advocated for plebeian interests domestically and foreign peoples’ interests abroad. For Cicero and Cato, the “country” referred only to the city-state of Rome, and their primary aim was to protect the interests of the Senate class.

Brutus was, relatively speaking, an idealist—but such idealists are prone to being exploited and pushed to the forefront, making it all too easy for him to be swayed by biased and malicious insinuations. However, those who leveled such accusations often had motives far less noble than they claimed; their words were laced with self-interest. Moreover, while they slandered others with their speech, they themselves shrank from taking risks, revealing their hypocrisy. Brutus’s post-assassination speech *I Love Caesar, But I Love Rome More* laid bare the inner contradictions of his character.  

Julius Caesar, with his unconventional personality, unorthodox methods, and coexistence of ambition and grand vision, is indeed a complex figure to assess. Yet his repeated acts of leniency toward enemies, his mutual respect for fellow heroes, the tangible benefits he brought to commoners, the civilization and peace he extended to barbarian tribes, his disregard for personal safety and authority, and his method of selecting successors all reveal his underlying aspirations. Caesar’s core ideal was "tolerance." Thus, he brought distinguished Greeks, Spaniards, Gauls, and Germans into the Senate. He granted citizenship to slaves, Jews, and former enemies. In Caesar’s vision, this state was to approximate a "Kingdom of Virtue"—a realm with open gates to all virtuous individuals, one that refrained from grabbing benefits from other virtuous groups. Once truly established, such a state would have no fixed borders, no rigid ethnic boundaries, no irreconcilable conflicts, and even no fixed lifespan. Yet for the intellectual and moral standards of his era, this vision was fated to remain unfulfilled.

### Group Grabbingism: An Evolutionary Outcome of Human Group Intensification  

We observe that the rise of Legalism and *The Prince* alike was conditioned by specific circumstances. Originally, under the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism, human groups maintained evolutionary stability. However, as group organization intensified, population density surged[, with ongoing geopolitical conflicts between different groups and intensifying contradictions in group competition, the tendency toward Group Grabbingism prioritizing national interests inevitably became an evolutionary trend.]() This mirrors the Cambrian Period, when multicellular biological "kingdoms" engaged in life-and-death struggles, driving the evolution of grabbing structures such as massive claws and sharp teeth.  

Humans, with their capacity for analogical reasoning, sought solutions from the outset. Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism made attempts: for the East, this took the form of the Rites of Zhou and Confucian ethos; for the West, it was Rome’s multi-ethnic cooperative spirit and later religions. Yet establishing "group morality" proved far more arduous than cultivating individual morality, as it too fell prey to Group Hypocrisyism. It required the majority of the group to recognize the evolutionary trajectory and foresee future tragedies—yet even the wisest thinkers of the era (perhaps only the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Caesar among them) struggled to grasp this, let alone the general populace. [Thus, this "group morality" quickly began to unravel.]() [Both Legalism and *The Prince* emerged against the backdrop of the dissolution of traditional "group morality."]() The transition from the Spring and Autumn to the Warring States period marked the unraveling of the Rites of Zhou; the latter half of the Middle Ages saw the unraveling of European religious morality.  

Wu Qi, Shang Yang (exponents of Legalism), and Machiavelli independently observed that groups flouting rules and norms outperformed those adhering to them. This was no longer a matter of mere advantage but of survival: rule-abiding groups were being driven to the brink of elimination. Thus, they codified their "discoveries," arguing that for the supreme interest of our group, we must abandon "queuing"—our own survival takes precedence over all else. Notably, [this process unfolded over a millennium earlier in Chinese civilization than in Western civilization.]() The intensification and escalation of group competition in the East preceded similar developments in the West by a thousand years, rendering Eastern civilization "premature"—a topic we will revisit in later chapters.  

Yet when "group morality" dissolves, what remains? When groups are forced to counteract Group Grabbingism with reciprocal grabbing ("fighting violence with violence"), and revert to the jungle laws, how can we achieve a "good end" in this Hobbesian Jungle where every group is an enemy to all others, and fear pervades every moment? [Colonial wars, World Wars I and II, genocides, and the U.S.-Soviet Cold War in modern history all bear the fangs of Group Grabbingism. This remains one of humanity’s most pressing issues requiring collective solutions.]()  

Both Legalism and *The Prince* overlooked the virtuous aspects of human nature and the power of cooperation. Born from the jungle, they succumbed to its laws, prioritizing short-term group interests—later devolving into the pursuit of short-term interests of imperial families alone. This sacrificed the interests of other groups, the long-term interests of their own group, and even the long-term interests of the rulers themselves; reformers often met tragic fates. Though their methods brought dazzling yet fleeting victories under the influence of this potent "stimulant," we must acknowledge that such short-term success was also a product of natural selection. Without corrective human intervention, this evolutionary trajectory is inevitable. After all, Murphy’s Law holds in Adversarial Evolution—if the worst-case scenario exists, it will occur. [This, it must be said, is a tragedy of humanity’s Edenic Period, a crisis within the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism. With Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism difficult to establish, Group Grabbingism became the sole viable survival strategy. This group-level Hobbesian Jungle, more terrifying than its individual counterpart, has wrought large-scale slaughter and death, sowing hatred and resentment that echo across millennia.]()
