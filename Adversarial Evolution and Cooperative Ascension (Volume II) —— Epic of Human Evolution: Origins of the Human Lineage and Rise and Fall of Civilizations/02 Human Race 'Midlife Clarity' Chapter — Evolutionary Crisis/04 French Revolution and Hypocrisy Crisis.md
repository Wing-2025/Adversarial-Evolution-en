# The French Revolution and the Crisis of Hypocrisyism  
In the previous section, we discussed the rise of Group Grabbingism and its intrinsic impact on historical development and human evolutionary trends, drawing on some historical facts. This ideological current has directly undermined the evolutionary stability of the Virtue Selection-morality mechanism, plunging humanity into an unprecedented evolutionary crisis. Moving forward, we will continue to explore another evolutionary crisis facing humanity—the spread of Hypocrisyism—through analysis of historical events.  

The evolution of Hypocrisyism has accompanied the entire process of the rise of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. We have already conducted an in-depth discussion of its causes in the previous volume. Hypocrisyism is akin to cancer cells: initially, one may be entirely unaware of its presence, yet it rapidly spreads insidiously until it pervades the entire system, leaving no room for reversal. What we can observe is that the trend of hypocrisy has intensified as humanity moved beyond clan-based patriarchal societies. The corruption of ruling classes, nobles, religions, and Confucianism cannot be separated from the machinations of hypocrites. This corruptive trend does not stop at a small clique of rulers or privileged classes; it spreads to the general populace, even to the oppressed commoners.  

Hypocrites not only excel at feigning virtue but also at using "Virtue Selection" as a weapon for moral coercion, ultimately eliminating dissidents. Deception, double standards, and PUA are among the few discernible "abnormalities" in their behavior. Otherwise, one might easily mistake them for idealists or champions of justice.  
[The harm caused by hypocrisy far exceeds that of class conflicts or threats from enemy states. Without hypocrisy, classes could identify common interests and make necessary compromises; without hypocrisy, members of society could understand, tolerate, and support one another. However, hypocrisy muddies these waters, making it impossible to distinguish friend from foe or good from evil. It normalizes suspicion, distrust, and mutual slander. It allows sophists to commit evil deeds under the guise of justice; it enables schemers to manipulate public sentiment to create situations favorable to themselves, thereby controlling the direction of events.]()  

The French Revolution is a classic historical event often analyzed by later generations. It has been examined from multiple perspectives: class struggle, democracy and freedom in its early stages, to the tyranny of the majority, violent democracy, and the "crowd" phenomenon in later analyses. Here, we will briefly analyze the French Revolution from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution. I emphasize again that I do not aim to reconstruct historical truth; rather, I will conduct logical deductions based on the historical materials I have studied.  
[Historical materials may be erroneous, and conclusions may be flawed, but I will strive to ensure the validity of my logical deductions. This remains sufficiently meaningful for illustrating evolutionary principles.]()  

## An Overview of the French Revolution  
I do not intend to detail the entire process of the French Revolution; interested readers may refer to online resources. Here, I provide a brief introduction. The background of the French Revolution is as follows: the long-standing greed of the monarchy and the Church led thinkers such as Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu to deeply question the old regime. Rousseau’s *Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men* and *The Social Contract* exerted significant influence on the French populace, directly undermining the foundational logic of the divine right of kings and the Church’s justification of royal authority. This intellectual trend sparked the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688. The Enlightenment profoundly impacted the thoughts of the French people.  
<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5057209-2b0f-4ff2-9eed-de2d0b9d7d36" />  
</p>  
This laid the groundwork for the tragic fate of Louis XVI’s monarchy. France at the time also faced class conflicts similar to those in England. The intensification of these conflicts stemmed from the nobility—the First and Second Estates, consisting of clergy and aristocrats—who, amid the crises of severe famine and empty state coffers, refused to yield benefits to the people and persisted in maximizing their short-term interests. This was partly related to the sale of offices during the reign of Louis XIV; some office-buyers had not yet recouped their investments by Louis XVI’s time. Additionally, an economic crisis during Louis XV’s reign—the Mississippi Company scam—accelerated the onset of the French Revolution. The Mississippi Bubble was the most severe economic bubble in French history. France’s defeat in the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) further strained French society, leading to rising prices and stagnant wages. Droughts in 1785 and 1788 exacerbated the burden on the lower classes; some accounts suggest that food expenditures accounted for 80% of commoners’ total income.  

The main plot of the French Revolution then unfolded: Louis XVI convened the Estates-General to address financial issues (hoping the Third Estate would pressure the First and Second Estates to pay taxes, or vice versa), but negotiations collapsed. Insurgents stormed the Bastille, nominally to free political prisoners but in reality to seize weapons (the Bastille held only seven prisoners at the time). Louis XVI subsequently compromised, and the famous *Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen* was adopted. The National Constituent Assembly abolished princes, hereditary nobility, and noble titles, and reorganized administrative regions. It established the Cour de Cassation, the Supreme Court, and a jury system. The Assembly also confiscated Church property, declared the French Church independent of the Pope and under state control, and achieved the separation of church and state.  
[In fact, by this point, the French Revolution had already achieved significant successes.]() During this process, Louis XVI demonstrated openness and tolerance, repeatedly expressing support for the Constituent Assembly and publicly swearing to uphold the constitution at the anniversary ceremony of the Bastille’s fall.  
[If the French Revolution had rationally sought compromise points among classes at this stage, it might well have established a situation akin to England’s Glorious Revolution.]()  

However, the Constituent Assembly’s demands on the monarchy grew increasingly stringent. The "October Events," fueled by certain individuals, led to a march of Parisian women (linked to the Duke of Orléans, as discussed later). Louis XVI clearly felt his personal safety was under threat, but his political naivety—hiring foreign troops, contacting foreign monarchs—eroded public trust. This culminated in the king’s attempted escape. The French Revolution alarmed neighboring states; Prussia and Austria formed a coalition to attack France. Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI’s wife and the sister of the Austrian emperor, leaked military secrets to the coalition, leading to French defeats and the coalition’s invasion of France. Meanwhile, French forces had advanced abroad by October 1792. European powers grew fearful, and in February 1793, Prussia, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Sardinia, Hanover, and Britain formed the Coalition against France to intervene militarily.  

However, these events are not the focus of this text. We have heard many stories of corrupt ruling classes inciting the exploited to revolt.  
[Yet the French Revolution was far more complex than such a binary narrative; its chaos is historically representative and typical, warranting deeper reflection. To some extent, it reveals how the later evolutionary trends of deception and historical dilemmas first took shape.]()  

Next, we will focus on the "interesting" role played by the Jacobins—ostensibly the just representatives of France’s Third Estate—in this revolution.  

By 1793, the French Revolution had become a wild, unbridled force, charging forward blindly. The Girondins, attempting to rein it in, and the Jacobins, whipping it to run faster, were locked in irreconcilable opposition. The rise of the Jacobins, led by Robespierre, was unstoppable. The Jacobins were the closest representatives of the Third Estate, advocating the most radical ideals of liberty and democracy.  
[Yet their political actions more closely resembled a series of factional struggles and acts of vengeance.]()  

Under their rule, the lower classes briefly vented their anger—executing those they hated. Without substantial evidence, and even by murdering witnesses, they sentenced Louis XVI to death. They established the Committee of Public Safety, beheading the Girondins and their supporters (including Brissot, Madame Roland, and Corday), who had actively promoted the early revolution. The American revolutionary Thomas Paine was also imprisoned. During this period, thousands of suspected counter-revolutionaries were sent to the guillotine, many without trial, in brutal executions.  
[Many of these victims were advocates of the French Revolution and relatively moderate, enlightened figures.]()  

In February 1794, Robespierre delivered his famous speech *Terror and Virtue*, asserting, "Terror without virtue is evil; virtue without terror is weak." By this point, the French Revolution had completely deviated from the ideals of democracy, liberty, and equality, reverting to a Hobbesian Jungle State—where whoever held power was deemed just, and could act with impunity. Later, Marat, one of the Jacobins’ key leaders, was assassinated by Charlotte Corday in his bathtub. After Marat’s death, Robespierre executed Danton, Hébert, and others within the Jacobins who disagreed with him, accusing them of conspiracy.  

The French Revolution initially aimed to overthrow religion, but Robespierre delivered speeches burning idols symbolizing atheism and nihilism, and presided over a ceremony to celebrate the new cult of the Supreme Being—attempting to establish a new religion centered on patriotism.

Within the National Convention, the forces opposing Robespierre coalesced into the Thermidorians. Among them were many whom Robespierre had labeled "conspirators and fraudsters intending to be purged." Fearing retribution from Robespierre, they struck first, launching the Thermidorian Reaction on July 27, 1794 (9 Thermidor Year II of the French Republican Calendar) to overthrow Robespierre and have him beheaded. [In the end, the French Revolution culminated in Napoleon's autocratic rule and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty, almost entirely betraying the original ideals of the revolution.]() The above outlines the general course of the French Revolution.  

## Robespierre: The "Wang Mang" of the French Revolution  
Robespierre merits special discussion. Born into a family of lawyers, he lost his mother in childhood, and his father later abandoned the family. Raised and educated by his maternal grandfather, he first attended school in Arras. In 1769, he transferred to the prestigious Collège Louis-le-Grand in Paris, where he excelled academically through diligence. In 1778, he enrolled in the University of Paris to study law, devouring the works of Enlightenment thinkers—particularly Rousseau—and becoming deeply devoted to Rousseau's doctrines. After graduating in 1781, he returned to his hometown to practice law, earning local admiration and support by frequently defending the poor.  

During the Revolution, Robespierre's stance oscillated. Conservatives deemed him overly radical, while radicals (notably the Cordeliers Club and later the Hébertists) saw him as too moderate. He initially opposed trying Louis XVI but later championed sending the king to the guillotine against popular opinion. Though he attempted to save some Girondins and the queen, he ultimately failed.  

Assessing Robespierre's life, it is hard to deny his ambition—without some drive, one could not rise to such heights amid the chaos. Yet he was no unscrupulous power-seeker; he maintained moral principles and rationality. [After all, securing procedural justice while pursuing outcome justice is fraught with tension. Whether this stems from personal interest or the pursuit of outcome justice remains a root difficulty in judging historical figures.]()  

In many ways, Robespierre embodied traditional morality and stood as a guardian of Enlightenment thought, particularly advocating Rousseau's theories in the Revolution's practice. He was patriotic, collectivist, and rationalist, believing reason could guide humanity forward. He remained clear-headed enough to check radical excesses and balance factions, even as his efforts often faltered. He vehemently opposed what he saw as evil, relentlessly combating corruption. Later, even as his power waned, he defied military-industrial interests to oppose expansionist aggression. He remained steadfast to his vision of justice. When the Thermidorians launched their coup, the Paris Commune mobilized district citizens, with 17 districts prepared to fight for him. Unlike most power-seekers, he hesitated, renounced resistance, and was arrested and executed. Near the end of his rule and life, he came to grasp his powerlessness against hypocrisy: "He realized, late in life, that he had no one he could trust," a revelation that left him enraged, led him to withdraw from public duties, and even spurred a suicide attempt. (Biographical details on Robespierre draw primarily from *The Oxford History of the French Revolution*.)  

Robespierre's fate mirrored that of Wang Mang—both were paragons of theory and personal morality, yet equally unprepared for the world's duplicity and hypocrisy. Both were elevated to adulation before plummeting into infamy. [Their failures stemmed from a lack of critical reflection on their doctrines, descending into rigid dogmatism. Their theories were detached from reality and unimplementable. Their binary, extremist views and overly narrow class-based or division-of-labor perspectives reduced their movements to attempts by one exploited social group to replace or eliminate another—a fundamentally flawed and unsustainable approach.]()  

Robespierre possessed considerable theoretical acumen and historical-legal knowledge, yet the liberty-and-equality doctrines he championed contained untested flaws. [Most attempts to drive social change through single-minded, revolutionary adherence to untested theories—from Wang Mang's reforms to Utopian experiments, the French Revolution, and Soviet socialism—have failed. The near-unique exception is the New Democratic and socialist revolutions led by the Communist Party of China, guided by more mature theories and a spirit of self-reflection, which stands as an extraordinarily rare success among such theory-driven revolutions.]() Here, China's great theoretical practitioners demonstrated profound wisdom. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, for instance, astutely emphasized "Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth" during theoretical implementation—eschewing dogmatism and self-serving interpretation. All untested theories require continuous refinement, adjustment, and practical grounding. In France, Russia, and elsewhere, great theories faltered due to their flaws and the radical, dogmatic application by their proponents. Only in China has such an approach achieved unprecedented success. [This success arises from a resolute spirit of self-reflection and fearless self-criticism.]()  

Reading Robespierre's speeches, I cannot help but classify him as a "hypocrite," a hypocrisy manifest in double standards. Consider his argument during Louis XVI's trial: "If we do not kill the king, we are guilty." The implication—that the king *must* be guilty and die to prove the revolutionaries' innocence—exemplifies his sophistry. Such rhetorical tricks were common. When critics argued the Revolution had gone too far, Robespierre countered: "[If the people's actions are now illegal, what were your past acts? Was storming the Bastille, dethroning the king, or executing nobles legal? How many revolutionary acts from the start have been legal? Is liberty itself illegal?]()"  

In February 1794, Robespierre delivered his infamous *Terror and Virtue* speech: "Terror without virtue is evil; virtue without terror is weak." As a lawyer, he excelled in sophistry. Yet scrutiny reveals his arguments rarely began and ended with genuine justice. Liberty and justice often served as tools to persuade others—or himself. Whether his claims were truly just remains questionable; they were more about rhetorical triumph. I must note that Rousseau's followers often harbored personal motives. The ideals of liberty and equality were easily weaponized for evil, as Caesar observed: "No one wants to see the whole truth; most only wish to see what they desire." The subtext: [No one truly seeks to change all things; most aim only to alter what they wish to change.]() This explains why most hypocrites drive events to the opposite of their proclaimed goals, unaware of their own contradictions.  

Like many revolutionaries, these figures distilled simplified principles from Enlightenment thought, then, emboldened by these ideas and propelled by hypocritical impulses, perpetrated mass violence. They saw themselves as just—or frantically clung to a sliver of justification. Having endured immense suffering, their resentment found no outlet. They were also victims of the hypocritical trend, lacking the time or capacity to discern miscarriages of justice. They praised virtue, hated grabbingism, yet were swept up by hypocrisy, bolstered by self-righteous theories, and unyielding in their demands. Their aim to "cut out the tumor" was noble, but their lack of "medical knowledge" led them to destroy healthy, necessary "cells" alongside the malignancy. Thus, they, too, embodied hypocrisy.  

By traditional moral standards, Robespierre was undeniably moral, idealistic, and principled. Yet he was hindered by his immature theory's flaws, underestimated the "social cancer" of hypocrites and opportunists, and lacked political experience. The French Revolution's tragic outcome bore his responsibility, yet was also, objectively, nearly inevitable. His final suicide attempt and refusal to resist reflected a wavering in his faith—or a clearer reckoning—preserving a last shred of personal honor.  

## Liberty, Liberty, How Many Evils Are Perpetrated in Thy Name  
After the early, more pragmatic constitutionalists and Girondins faded from power, the French Revolution devolved into hypocrites leading naive masses in grabbingist pursuits, even using the people to advance their own tyrannical ambitions. Some may object to labeling them "hypocrites," but [here, "hypocrisy" need not be conscious; it is often unconscious].() They acted in the name of goodness, passing moral scrutiny, yet perpetrated evil.

I do not doubt that they harbored ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, yet their primary aim was to realize the freedom and equality they personally espoused, while expecting to receive benevolence from others. When it came to practicing fraternity and granting freedom and equality to others, however, they revealed a reactionary streak more extreme than that of feudal tyrants or decadent nobles. This has little to do with their proclaimed motives—perhaps their superficial motivations were indeed the "justice" they claimed, such as the pursuit of liberty, equality, and fraternity—but their actions amounted to the opposite: arbitrarily depriving others of life and freedom without trial; mercilessly massacring classes they despised, political opponents, and critics, even deriving enjoyment from the process. Robespierre once declared in a speech: "If we do not kill the king, we are guilty"; "How many revolutionary acts from the start of the revolution have been legal? Is liberty itself illegal?" These remarks exemplify their demagoguery and conflation of concepts. Robespierre’s oratory repeatedly espoused a robber’s logic: *[We eliminate our opponents to prove we are right.]*—His underlying reasoning seemed to be: If we eradicate all who oppose us, there will be no dissent, and we will be deemed correct. Madame Roland’s final words—"Liberty, Liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy name!"—cut to the core. I believe Madame Roland, in her final moments, came to understand that these lofty, virtuous-sounding pretexts served only the will of hypocrisyists. The French Revolution was a classic tragedy: everyone sought liberty, as if boundless freedom would be universally attained, yet most ultimately lost their freedom—and even their lives.  
<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1e76e9a-e07f-4fb0-80fb-772aa51a6715" />  
</p>  

### Charlotte Corday—Perhaps the Embodiment of True Revolutionary Spirit  
The French Revolution saw all classes infiltrated by hypocrisyists and egoists who sought to seize revolutionary fruits and exploit revolutionaries’ blood, rendering a superficially progressive movement rife with intrigue and brutality. Yet this was not the whole story. Amid the chaos, we still find upright, kind, and chivalrous revolutionary heroes—among them, the female assassin Charlotte Corday. Possessed of independent thought and discerning moral judgment, this delicate woman stepped onto the historical stage with clarity and resolve, striving to alter history’s course through her singular action—I believe her sacrifice truly saved countless innocent lives. Regrettably, such noble spirit is rarely passed down; it flares brightly only to fade into oblivion.  
<p align="center"><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0abc52ef-d5af-439f-a1d9-9b59d1fd08b1" />  
</p>  

A gentle and quiet woman, Corday held Jean-Paul Marat primarily responsible for the "September Massacres" of 1792, in which approximately 1,200 detainees—mostly common criminals—were slaughtered without trial. Marat, she believed, was also the instigator of other violent incidents. At the time, Marat, the revolutionary leader dominating Paris, allowed civilians to pillage and kill without restraint. A man of cruelty, he proposed setting up spectator seats in prison courtyards so ordinary citizens could watch nobles be hanged. His final exchange with Corday unfolded as follows: Pretending to be an informant providing names of Girondins, Corday approached Marat, who demanded, "These Girondin traitors! How many are there?" "Eighteen," she replied. "I need their names now." As Corday listed them one by one, Marat scribbled them down, exclaiming, "Excellent! They’ll be on the guillotine in Paris within days." Marat had been entirely consumed by hatred, and his targets of vengeance were no longer just legally convicted grabbingists, but all members of the privileged classes or those who disagreed with him. It was then that Corday stabbed Marat in the chest, killing him.  
<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac10a0d-219c-4998-ba80-549f9b82d03d" />  
</p>  

After completing her act, Corday moved to an adjacent room and calmly awaited arrest. Influenced by the philosophies of Rousseau and Voltaire, this young woman represented the choice of a citizen unaligned with any class, a non-hypocritical individual genuinely concerned with the fate of the nation and the republic. Her actions also reflected a rare dialectical perspective among the masses: On one hand, she was no royalist—"I acknowledge that Louis XVI was a revered king," she stated, "yet he was also weak and ineffectual, for he could not shield his people from suffering." On the other hand, she deemed Marat’s call for Louis XVI’s execution unnecessary and a stain on the republic’s virtue. After police detained her and transported her to the nearby Abbey Prison, Jacobin deputies rushed to see her. Upon first glimpsing this composed, self-possessed young woman, they could not hide their astonishment. To their chagrin, neither interrogation nor search uncovered any link between her and the exiled Girondin deputies. Among her belongings—travel papers, birth certificate, watch, and money—was a sewing kit: A thoughtful girl, she had prepared to mend her clothes in prison should they be torn during arrest.  

Corday’s trial, held on July 17, 1793, drew a throng of spectators eager to see the "female murderer," filling the gallery to capacity. Calm and proud throughout, she recounted the assassination without offering a single defense. When asked her motive, she replied succinctly: "For the peace of the republic." She lost her composure only once—when the judge asked, "You’re quite skilled at killing; have you done this before?" Her face flushing, she retorted, "How insulting! Do you take me for a murderer?" The jury deliberated for mere minutes before pronouncing the death sentence. Execution was set for 5 p.m., leaving but a few hours. In her final moments, Corday spent time with an artist sketching her portrait. Before the drawing was complete, executioner Charles-Henri Sanson entered with scissors to cut her hair and a red gown—red signifying a murder conviction. For an instant, Corday paled, her voice trembling: "Is it time already?" But she soon regained her poise. After her golden hair was shorn, she handed a lock to the artist: "I have nothing else to thank you with; please accept this." Though Sanson pitied the girl, he could do nothing but lead her to her fate. As he bound her hands, he noticed the marks on her wrists and sighed, "They were too rough. I would never have treated you so." "Indeed," she smiled, "they were less adept than you."  

Before boarding the prison cart, Corday requested to stand for the journey to the guillotine. "It’s a long way," Sanson warned. She shrugged: "We’ll arrive eventually, won’t we?" Along the route, angry crowds hurled insults, yet many citizens regarded her with ineffable respect and affection for her sincerity and courage. Midway, a sudden downpour soaked her, clinging the red gown to her frame—she stood like a statue, radiating a stunning, almost otherworldly beauty. "For a full week afterward," recalled a man named Pierre Notellet, "Corday became the lover of my dreams."  

At Revolution Square, where the guillotine stood, Sanson stepped in front of Corday to shield her from the sight of the device. "Please let me see it," she requested. "I’ve never laid eyes on one before." These words pierced Sanson’s heart. En route, Corday had asked Sanson: "Will Marat truly be interred in the Panthéon?" Sanson did not answer. Indeed, after a grand funeral, Marat’s remains were placed in the Panthéon, alongside great philosophers like Voltaire and Rousseau—but when the Jacobins fell, he was promptly removed.  

*The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind* discusses the unconscious behavior of groups—impulsiveness, suggestibility, emotional exaggeration, and bigotry. Yet we cannot label the Third Estate entirely "the crowd," despite the many who kissed Marat’s hand. There were also those who supported Corday and those moved by her. The Third Estate was a mix of all types, not to be "represented" as a monolith. A nonpartisan like Charlotte Corday, with her impartial stance and clear mind, *from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, Corday was precisely upholding the "Virtue Selection" mechanism of justice.* She may well be one of the few true heroes of the French Revolution.

After killing Marat, Charlotte Corday did not flee. Thus, she defended the majesty of the law with her own death. Though she judged Marat by her own sense of justice, she did not profane the right of others to their own "justice." Her reason for the assassination was: "I killed one man to save one hundred thousand; I killed a great evildoer to save the innocent; I killed a beast to bring peace to my nation." Robespierre had spoken similarly when inciting the Assembly to execute Louis XVI, but there was a fundamental difference between them. Robespierre was actually driven by fear that Louis XVI, if given time to recover, would retaliate against them. His primary concern was the impact on himself, not the justice of extrajudicial killing. He incited the Assembly by declaring that if we do not kill the king, our entire revolution will be deemed guilty. [In contrast, this young girl, Charlotte Corday, acted to stop a man she believed was driven solely by vengeance and was undermining the virtues and fate of the Republic. From the start, she had already prepared to accept legal responsibility.] This, perhaps, is the essential distinction between an upright Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individual and a Hypocrisyist. Corday made moral judgments with impartiality, approaching issues from a holistic perspective, which reflects a sound [holistic moral outlook]. Perhaps Corday is one of the few stars in the French Revolution that truly shines with the light of genuine humanity.  

### Virtue and Evil Transcend Class: Avoiding Class-Based Limitations  
Traditional historiography posits that the French Revolution was a class struggle—a bourgeois revolution. It is seen as marking the transition from feudalism to capitalism in world history, a view first proposed by early 19th-century French historians and later developed by Marx. Historians often seek to distill history into concise, universal laws, akin to the laws of mathematics or physics. Class struggle and the replacement of feudalism by capitalism are among such laws. But is this an accurate framework? Does rigid application risk bias? Does oversimplification obscure the truth?  

First, let us not be misled by the term "class"—it often [erroneously assumes that within a single class, all members are uniform]; that a class consists of identical individuals. [This is a major misconception in historical analysis.] It is an oversimplification we employ to streamline historical interpretation. Among most analyses of the French Revolution, I admire Tocqueville’s concrete and meticulous approach. He did not force history into theoretical frameworks but compared and analyzed the institutions of France before and after the Revolution. Tocqueville was a true thinker on the transition between old and new systems. When he carefully examined the two societies, he was startled to discover:  

> The Revolution was not the result of revolutionary efforts but brewed within the old system itself; the vices of the old system were transplanted intact into the new. The Revolution decapitated Louis XVI and abolished the nobility, but the new nobility that replaced them was more greedy and tyrannical than the old monarchy and aristocracy...  

Why was this the case? Tocqueville traced the root cause: the French people remained the same, and France, composed of these individuals, had not truly changed. After the Revolution, the French still obsessed over civil service; rural and urban divides persisted; power remained centralized, law marginalized, administrative efficiency low, and wealth disparities stark... Clearly, Tocqueville viewed the France before and after the Revolution as stagnant, with the fundamental cause lying in the unchanged nature of the French people: Grabbingists continued to exploit, Hypocrisyists to stir chaos—all irrespective of class.  

In fact, [nearly every class contains Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individuals, Grabbingists, and Hypocrisyists]. At the Revolution’s outset, many nobles and clergy were Grabbingists, refusing to contribute during national crises. Yet some nobles voluntarily renounced privileges, proving more cooperative. Lafayette, of noble lineage, stood with the revolutionaries and was among the first to advocate reform—truly hoping the Revolution would advance France. Mirabeau, ostensibly aligned with the Third Estate, secretly accepted bribes, damaging the reputation of the constitutionalists. The Duke of Orléans, also of the Third Estate, likely harbored ambitions to seize the French throne (his son later became king). Their apparent support for democracy and incitement of the masses were likely Hypocrisyist acts of self-interest. Mirabeau and the Duke of Orléans were more like revolutionary opportunists, lacking principle or integrity.  

In truth, the French Revolution reveals how movements for progress were severely distorted and scarred by Hypocrisyism. Let us elaborate on the Duke of Orléans, Louis Philippe Joseph. He married the daughter of his cousin, Admiral Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, and through this union became one of France’s wealthiest men. Ostensibly a devout follower of Rousseau and advocate for Enlightenment ideals—democracy, separation of church and state, and the abolition of feudalism and slavery—he joined the Jacobins. Dismayed by his royal name, he renamed himself "Philippe Égalité" ("Equality Philip"). He distributed food and money to the poor and sheltered the homeless during the harsh winter of 1788–1789. Superficially, his "progressive" ideals were striking, but clues suggest his true aim was to depose his relative, Louis XVI, and claim the throne as first in line. On July 14, 1789, he stormed the Bastille with the Parisian masses, becoming a national hero. He also instigated the Women’s March on Versailles (October Days) and was accused of funding the riots, with mobs chanting, "Long live our father, the King of Orléans!" Later, his vote was pivotal in Louis XVI’s execution. He was eventually executed by the Jacobins, implicated by his son’s defection. His ambitions remained hidden in life, but Tocqueville’s critique of his son—another Duke of Orléans and later King—reveals much:  

> This man was a political skeptic of both the 19th and 18th centuries, devoid of belief and distrustful of others’ faith. By nature, he craved power and favored sycophants. His flaws mirrored his era, making him a disaster that rendered the "disease" incurable.  

Indeed, the so-called "Citizen King" was a vulgar mediocrity (mocked by legitimists as a "barricade king," his crown bestowed by rioters behind barricades). He possessed the cunning and pragmatism of the bourgeoisie but lacked lofty goals, ruling with neither virtue nor dignity—governing the nation like a grocer. This king with a pear-shaped head, self-aware, did not aspire to grand achievements but merely suppressed legitimists and radical republicans while balancing the "movement" and "resistance" factions within the constitutionalists (Orléanists) to preserve his power.  

The Third Estate was even more heterogeneous. Revolutionary government commissioners, often promoted from the lower classes, abused their power—embezzling, plundering churches, and forcing clergy to renounce their vows and marry. Their actions drastically eroded the revolutionaries’ public image. During the later Jacobin Reign of Terror, Robespierre himself became overwhelmed by Hypocrisyists and fraudsters. First, he clashed with the Cordeliers Club, viewing Fabre as greedy, deceitful, and corrupt (involved in the India Company scandal). He grew suspicious of prominent associates like Danton, whom he accused of factionalism, prioritizing friends over patriotism. Later, he targeted Fouché and Tallien—future Thermidorians—calling them a "conspiracy against public liberty," declaring, "As long as power is entangled with scoundrels, the guardians of freedom will remain exiled." Throughout spring 1794, rumors of plots surrounded Robespierre, leaving him distrustful of nearly all in public life. By his downfall, he lacked the will to resist and even attempted suicide (or was killed), reflecting his disillusionment with Third Estate colleagues and the Revolution itself.  

Conspiracy theories suggest Freemasons secretly orchestrated the French Revolution, funding the Jacobins to overthrow the French monarchy and advance European capitalism. Yet why did they not support the Girondins? Why did the Revolution spiral out of control, resulting in massive casualties? Such theories are unconvincing; Freemasons likely played at most a minor role. They could not simultaneously have controlled Napoleon’s voluntary defeat at Waterloo and enabled the Rothschilds to profit wildly from British bonds. If such conspiracies were true, human Hypocrisyism would be even deeper than imagined.

The French Revolution resembles more of a political event incited by hypocritical opportunists—some overly idealistic, some double-faced, some resentful, and some with ulterior motives—under the guidance of immature theories. Hypocrisyists from various classes took turns on the stage, wielding "just" slogans like "equality" and "liberty" to harness the will of the people. Yet this "justice" was subjectively defined by their own class positions. Consciously or unconsciously, they exploited Enlightenment ideas lacking practical value as tools, deeply inflaming inter-class conflicts and bloodshed. However, their political acumen proved insufficient to control the Revolution’s trajectory. On multiple occasions when it could have stabilized at a state optimal for the whole, they instead fanned the flames, escalating contradictions—driven by personal idealistic delusions and the maximization of their own small-group interests. In the end, this only led to their own destruction, national catastrophe, and the turbulence of French history.  

Looking at the Revolution, the Constitutionalists and Girondins were relatively moderate and compromising. They opposed regicide, advocating for a smooth transition of French power—a outcome that, by the example of England’s Glorious Revolution, would have been relatively favorable for France. Even Louis XVI displayed repeated acts of mercy throughout the Revolution: he compromised when the Bastille was stormed, and when Parisian women demanded his return to the city. Compared to his predecessors, he was a mild and benevolent king—neither ostentatious like Louis XIV nor profligate like Louis XV. Louis XVI repeatedly attempted reforms, appointing economists like Turgot, banker Necker, and Calonne to tax the wealthy classes represented by nobles and clergy, aiming to address the fiscal deficit left by Louis XV. A highly skilled locksmith, his creations were veritable works of art. Once, noticing the guillotine’s straight blade dulled quickly, increasing the suffering of the condemned, he personally modified it into a triangular shape, significantly reducing pain. He loved his people; his final words were, "May France shed no more blood after my death." By all reason, the French Revolution could have reached consensus and avoided the subsequent bloodshed, given the favorable conditions. Yet hypocrisyists and political opportunists, driven by personal ambition or hidden agendas, repeatedly pushed the Revolution into the abyss—men like the vacillating Mirabeau, the incendiary Duke of Orléans, and above all Robespierre, Marat, and Hébert. Though they spouted rhetoric of freedom, democracy, justice, and human rights, they wielded power to enforce tyranny, darkness, and the disregard of human rights. Their ostensible goal was to overthrow feudalism, the Church, and the old order, but in reality, they engaged in factional strife, vengeance, purges, and the cult of personality. As they eliminated dissent one by one, they inevitably met their own "revolutionary" fates.  

The root of hypocrisy lies in selfishness and grabbing. The trend and extent of grabbing within a community reflect its survival state. Indeed, France during the Revolution was already rife with internal depletion. Tocqueville, in *The Old Regime and the Revolution* (Chapter 8), observed that "the French people were strikingly similar—a similarity not only within classes but across them." He even posited that swapping their positions would yield the same outcomes. "This homogeneous mass was fragmented into countless small units, each with an exclusive, independent structure caring only for its own interests," he wrote. Chapter 9 of his work directly states: "These similar people were more alienated than ever, forming isolated small groups indifferent to one another." Tocqueville identified 18th-century France’s numerous small groups as "Collective Individualism": "Each insisted on their special status, for others did the same by theirs."  

As three-dimensional individuals, people naturally think from their own perspectives, endorse values beneficial to their positions, and use these—intentionally or not—to defend their interests. Yet they often overlook the fairness of others’ positions and the collective good of society. Those holding differing positions "argue rationally" over their respective "correct" values, descending into mutual hatred and endless disputes. What they fail to realize is that excessive partiality to their own positions, which harm others’ interests, almost inevitably backfires. For such actions damage the collective interests of the cooperative group, compelling others to adopt more destructive means to protect their own interests. The situation deteriorates further, creating the classic "grabbing cycle."  

In reflecting on the French Revolution’s lessons, Tocqueville noted: "He who demands excessive freedom demands absolute servitude." I would add: "He who demands excessive interests demands extreme exploitation." For virtuous individuals cannot satisfy everyone’s demands for benefits exceeding their created value—only opportunistic fraudsters and authoritarians remain, to be selected as masters of these excess-seekers. History repeats itself, as this pattern has unfolded time and again.  

### Is the Class-Based Historical View Truly Valid?  
Somewhere along the way, the term "class" has been invoked more frequently. When pursuing their interests, people intentionally or not link class and position to foster empathy and solidarity, naturally "labeling" class positions. This simplifies understanding and aids politics, but it is not necessarily beneficial, nor does it clarify issues. For most species, the concept of "class" does not exist. If forced, only "male" and "female" might qualify. Yet with the advent of large-scale social division of labor, the concept of class emerged. By the Roman era, class stratification was pronounced: the Senate could be seen as the Empire’s "brain," and the Roman people its "body." This was so ingrained that Rome’s official name—*Senatus Populusque Romanus* (SPQR, "The Senate and the Roman People")—reflects it. In the late Republic, as Rome’s client states expanded, the plebeian class split into two based on citizenship, and Rome’s decline was tied to this division.  

"Class" refers to distinct cooperative roles in social division of labor—e.g., the Senate, knights, bourgeoisie, and working classes. Those in different roles share commonalities and a sense of shared fate, fostering natural affinity within classes and hostility between them. Yet we must remain clear: if we allow the notion of using division-of-labor categories to define "us vs. them" to deepen and radicalize, it becomes dangerous. Imagine bone cells in the human body resenting blood cells for their "freedom," sparking conflict and killing blood cells. Without blood supply, the entire body—including the bone cells—would perish.  

The term "class" may be a slow-acting poison. Mention "class," and the next word is often "conflict" or "opposition." Class inherently carries a small-group grabbing tendency. When we oppress other classes to secure extra benefits for our own, we may seem to claim victory. Yet this is a slow poison. In a cooperative group, classes form an integrated whole; injustice or oppression against any class weakens the group’s overall strength, and the cost will eventually rebound onto the grabbing class. Excessive greed by any class transforms a multi-win scenario into multi-loss. Whenever we gloat over excessive grabbing for ourselves or our class, we should feel concern—for such short-term gains almost always harm long-term cooperation, sowing seeds for future conflicts and reduced group efficacy.  

Excessive rights advocacy beyond just bounds is a form of grabbing. Today’s popular "rights movements" include much that is positive and worthy of support, but many cases involve overreach—"the louder complainant wins"—which severely undermines mutual cooperation and indirectly raises the bar for legitimate claimants. We should defend our just interests with appropriate demands, not pursue the maximization of our own or our class’s interests, as such goals often backfire. As the old adage goes: "Excess is as bad as deficiency."  

For a cooperative group, fair interest distribution promotes healthy evolution. Unfair distribution may yield temporary gains but will exact manifold repayment from future generations. Avoiding class limitations means avoiding positional limitations—a profoundly difficult task, yet a necessary pain for humanity’s dimensional ascension. People easily grasp the hardships, injustices, and irrationalities of their own roles and positions but rarely empathize with the challenges, unfairness, and pain of others’ roles. Nor do they consider how all roles contribute to the symbiotic "living organism" of society.

When we are swept into a class, driven by class interests to engage in radical actions, or蛊惑ed and manipulated by lofty slogans, we should reflect: does our conduct fundamentally align with these lofty slogans, or are we merely acting out of a heart of vengeance or Grabbingism? Are we defending our rights, or have we degenerated into members of a small-group Grabbingist clique?  

### Class Does Not Equate to "Kindred"  
On the other hand, we must remain clear-headed: nearly every class contains "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists," "Hypocrisyists," and "Grabbingists." What we truly need to identify are these moral labels, not rigid class labels. Only by categorizing people through this lens can we detect and eliminate genuine "cancerous cells" and stand a better chance of acting correctly.  

We observe that group behavior is easily misled by malicious or ambitious but incompetent individuals—commonly known as "opinion leaders." This was strikingly evident in both the democracy of the Athenian polis in ancient Greece and the democracy of the French Revolution. I never doubt that the masses are the creators of history, nor that the great souls propelling human progress often emerge from the masses. As previously emphasized, due to the demands of group Grabbingism, ruling classes tend toward Grabbingism, while virtue may be more preserved among the common people. When we say "the wisdom of the masses is great," this refers to the existence of individuals with exceptional wisdom within the masses—not that all masses are uniformly wise. We must not reduce the masses to a single class or assume uniformity within any class; every class contains Grabbingists, Virtue-Upholders, and Hypocrisyists, including the common people. Similarly, not all nobles are corrupt: during the Roman Republic, for example, the Gracchi brothers—descendants of the illustrious Scipio—belonged to the noble class but sacrificed themselves to advocate for plebeian rights.  

In reality, when two classes engage in undiscriminating "good vs. evil" confrontation, [it is often the "Virtue-Upholders" within both classes who suffer the greatest harm](), a pattern repeated throughout history. In such conflicts, Virtue-Upholders become shields for the wicked and the true executors of lofty ideals. As evolutionary crises deepen, the proportion of Grabbingists and Hypocrisyists has grown significant in most categorically defined groups. We may even argue that under the impetus of Adversarial Evolution, humanity has entered a paradoxical state: every individual necessarily embodies facets of Virtue-Upholding, Grabbingism, and Hypocrisyism. To evaluate a person or a group, we must strip away falsehoods, ground our analysis in the theory of Adversarial Evolution, and assess them comprehensively over time and across space (though this is nearly impractical). Ultimately, [what we must unite are not members of the same class, but kindred individuals—specifically, all Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists. This is the path to genuine long-term social stability]().  

### How Do Productive Forces Determine Production Relations?  
The arguments of Adversarial Evolution may appear to oppose the class-based historical view. Yet Adversarial Evolution is not an exclusionary theory. [On the contrary, the valid components of nearly all sound theories can be interpreted with greater unity and precision within the framework of Adversarial Evolution](). It aligns with many aspects of Marx's political economy. For instance, Marxism posits the principle that "the development of productive forces determines the transformation of production relations," but it does not explain [why productive forces determine production relations](). Nor does it rigorously demonstrate what drives the historical development of productive forces, relying instead on examples. With an understanding of Adversarial Evolution and Group Selection, we can delve deeper into this principle.  

First, what propels the continuous development of productive forces? Is it merely human desire for a better life? We know productive forces can stagnate or regress: feudal China saw sluggish progress, while Europe advanced rapidly in the same period. The primary driver is group competition—[group competition selects for groups with higher productive forces, or conversely, groups with higher productive forces are more likely to triumph in competition]() (simplifying here by omitting group Grabbingism).  

How do we enhance productive forces? The immediate answer is science and technology, as we are taught that "science and technology are the primary productive force." Yet how does science and technology emerge? It is "produced" by large groups: companies, universities, and collaborative networks. These individuals form an enormous cooperative network—[the so-called socialized large-scale division of labor](). Science and technology are products of this division of labor, as elaborated in *The Origin of Humanity* and not repeated here. Thus, cooperation enables division of labor, which begets science and technology—[Earth's life took billions of years to evolve the genetic foundations for complex human cooperation, yet only a few centuries to develop science and technology capable of reaching the heavens and exploring the depths]. The primacy of cooperation over technology should be clear. Indeed, [cooperation is the mother of science; science and technology are a concrete manifestation of the cooperative dividend](). Without a foundation of cooperation, scientists and specialists would lack both purpose and the necessary conditions for innovation—they would be too preoccupied with basic survival. Thus, I argue that cooperation is indeed the primary productive force.  

Returning to "productive forces determine production relations": we have established that productive forces rely on tighter cooperative relations, and [cooperative relations are a form of production relations](). The most efficient cooperative relations are those where each individual contributes their abilities and works with enthusiasm, unlocking creativity and potential. [Thus, the transition from slavery to feudalism to capitalism is less a result of productive force development than a need for social division of labor, increased group cooperation, or Dimension Ascension](). [The essence of "productive forces determining production relations" is that the degree of cooperation determines cooperative relations; and progress in cooperation is driven by group competition and Group Selection]() (after the analysis in the previous volume, I trust no one doubts the existence of Group Selection).  

<div align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/298f35b5-283d-4833-89bc-d2c4887bbf4a" /></div>  

[The true driving force and main thread of human social development is the enhancement of group cooperation, with the advancement of productive forces being a byproduct of this cooperation. If human conflicts escalate into mutual destruction, even the highest productive forces will only accelerate humanity’s demise]().  

## A Cross-Dimensional Analogy: The French Revolution  
From the perspective of three-dimensional life forms, the French Revolution resembled a conflict between the "brain cells" and "limb cells" of a human body. By the 18th century, France’s "brain cells" (the elite) had grown decadent and extravagant. The "limb cells" (the common people) felt exploited and sought greater "liberty" and "equality." However, the brain cells lacked a compelling rationale to justify their excessive resource consumption—relying instead on the "divine right of kings" to obfuscate. Some brain cells became idle, hoarding "exploited" resources without fulfilling their responsibilities—a widespread issue in 18th-century France. As the French monarchy centralized power, the nobility’s authority was marginalized, leaving them as passive Grabbingist cells living off others’ labor.  

Some limb cells, envious of the brain cells’ idle existence, sought to ascend to "pseudo-brain cell" status through "selling official positions." Lacking the ability or sense of duty of true brain cells, these pseudo-brain cells only deepened the limb cells’ resentment.

In this manner, the limb cells staged an uprising. Their goal was to eradicate all brain cells. Among them, some harbored the idea of promoting themselves to brain cells, envisioning a life of ease and idleness; others advocated for the outright abolition of brain cells. For the first group, a critical question arose: once promoted to brain cells, how would they justify their "exploitation"? Moreover, among the limb cells, no small number had undergone Individual Cancerization. Even more crucially, if all limb cells were to become brain cells, how could a four-dimensional life form, devoid of limbs, survive? The second group, radical in their rejection of brain cells, argued that brain cells served no purpose, deeming their "exploitation" unjust and all exploitative classes sinful. They naively believed that life would thrive without brain cells or immune systems.  

### On the Origin of Human Inequality  
To gain clarity on the intellectual roots of the French Revolution, we return to Rousseau and his *Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men*. Rousseau posited that in the "state of nature," "savages" lacked language, classes, and vices like desire and envy; they were free from wealth disparities and brutal wars, living in equality and freedom. It was the progress of human civilization, he argued, that introduced inequality. Rousseau distinguished between natural, physiological inequality and artificial, social inequality—ethical or spiritual in nature—which he deemed the true inequality. This artificial inequality, he claimed, stemmed from the emergence of private property, institutions of power, and the centralization and corruption of governmental authority.  

While Rousseau’s theory has merits—most notably challenging the divine right of kings and curbing the cancerization tendency of ruling classes—it contains significant flaws within the framework of Adversarial Evolution. First, he overly romanticized the savages’ existence in the pre-social state, ignoring their constant struggles with hunger, exposure, isolation, and precarity. Second, he was overly pessimistic about social institutions, focusing only on their corrupting and harmful aspects while neglecting their roles in upholding Virtue Selection Mechanisms, rewarding virtue, punishing vice, and sustaining high-dimensional cooperative communities. Third, his analysis remained rooted in the perspective of three-dimensional life forms, approaching issues from a self-interested lens. The core problem in France, however, was the cancerization of four-dimensional life, a phenomenon permeating all classes. All sought to maximize their own interests, viewing power as a concession. While such ideas are appealing, they are easily weaponized by self-interested actors, who eagerly adopt any theory or faction that justifies their Grabbingism.  

### Cooperation Maintenance Cost  
Here, I emphasize the concept of "Cooperation Maintenance Cost" introduced in the previous volume. This term refers to the material and energy expenditures required to sustain cooperative division of labor within a community and prevent internal strife. Tighter, more thorough cooperation yields greater Cooperative Dividends, but these dividends are not free; maintaining cooperative systems demands significant resources.  

[The more complex a living community, the more intricate its Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism and the higher its costs.] For example, a three-dimensional life form, a cooperative entity of trillions of cells, requires an extraordinarily complex system to sustain this collaboration. First, cellular communication relies on the nervous system—a vast network of nerve fibers that aggregates information from all body regions to the brain. Without this system, effective cooperation among cells would be nearly impossible. Second, the immune system, though unassuming, is critical. External threats are often less perilous than the proliferation of Grabbers and Hypocrites within the community, who insidiously erode cooperation. The immune system addresses this by maintaining the cooperative state. In humans, the immune system has evolved to extraordinary complexity—more so than any other bodily system—and yet it remains insufficient, as humanity’s most intractable diseases (cancer, AIDS, sepsis) are tied to immune dysfunction. The "effort" three-dimensional life expends to sustain cooperation is thus profound.  

Similarly, the brain acts as the command center of three-dimensional life, coordinating efforts and prioritizing the organism’s overall interests. Without the brain’s meticulous management, tasks like foraging, evading predators, tool-making, and scientific innovation would be unattainable. Drawing parallels to human social organization: the nervous system resembles transportation infrastructure (e.g., the Roman Empire’s roads, built at great cost to unify its vast territories). The immune system mirrors judicial and military systems, which internally enforce Virtue Selection (rewarding virtue, removing dysfunctional or harmful "cells") and externally defend the community from invasion. The human brain is analogous to the Roman Senate or centralized bureaucratic systems, whose authority ensures collective coherence and timely, adaptive decision-making.  

[These Cooperation Maintenance Systems do not generate direct benefits themselves but preserve and guide the cooperative, ordered state of living communities.] For instance, while the brain devises steps to craft a stone tool, the hands execute the task. Meanwhile, the immune system tirelessly removes internal and external Grabbers, ensuring the hands’ cells remain healthy and capable of tool-making. Superficially, the "credit" for the tool goes to the hand cells, but most rewards flow to the brain and immune cells—a seeming inequity. In reality, without the brain and immune system, the tool would never exist. (Even if feet were used, the same principle applies.) Similarly, in human societies, farmers and artisans may attribute their harvests or crafts solely to their labor, but they must acknowledge the governments and armies that safeguard their peaceful production. Rome’s early citizens understood this deeply: as citizen-soldiers, they farmed by day and defended their community by war, fostering equitable resource distribution that balanced plebeian and senatorial interests. This collective commitment enabled Rome to rise dominantly in the Mediterranean, surrounded by adversaries.  

[These Cooperation Maintenance Systems are indispensable to both three-dimensional and four-dimensional life forms. The cost of sustaining them is enormous, yet they are the most complex, distinctive, and extraordinary components of advanced life.] In the context of the French Revolution, the "brain cells" (royalty, nobility) and "immune cells" (the Church) had themselves become cancerized, leaving the "limb cells" (commoners) destitute. As religion was overthrown, the divine right of kings was challenged, and unrefined liberal democratic ideas spread, the "legitimacy" of the nobility and clergy collapsed. Some limb cells even advocated eradicating all brain and immune cells. Two issues arose: first, a human society cannot function without "brain cells"—the failures of direct democracy in ancient Greek city-states had already proven this. Second, the hasty ascension of limb cells to brain cells is incompatible with the division of labor in high-dimensional life. Eliminating all "exploitation" and "inequality" to return to Rousseau’s state of nature would squander massive Cooperative Dividends, making survival far harder. While rallying people to irrational acts under the banner of eliminating exploitation is easy, it contradicts the principles of life evolution. Thus, even under capitalism—deemed more advanced than feudalism—exploitation persists, and inequality deepens.  

### The Dilemma of the Immune System  
The immune system activates Pyroptosis to eliminate infected or pre-cancerous cells. Most pre-cancerous cells are detected and eradicated, much like overt Hypocrites in human societies, who are identified and sanctioned via Virtue Selection Mechanisms. The challenge arises with highly camouflaged cancer cells and sophisticated Hypocrites. Overactive immunity can be catastrophic, causing sepsis, septicemia, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome—conditions marked by persistent fever, shock, and even death. For four-dimensional life, confronting advanced Hypocrites presents a similar dilemma: the immune system must choose between tolerating them or overreacting, triggering widespread Pyroptosis and pushing the community into "fever," "shock," or collapse.

The French Revolution, for instance, bears a striking resemblance to a self-rescue action by the immune system of a Four-Dimensional Life Form. The populace, in radical activation of this immune system, initiated a widespread pyroptosis program due to the proliferation of Hypocrisyists—individuals whose true intentions were indistinguishable from genuine virtue. Operating under a "guilty until proven innocent" logic, they sought to eliminate all suspected "tumor cells" through their perceived moral and just means. The consequence was a state of systemic fever and shock for the entire French nation. This underscores the danger of high-order Hypocrisyists, who place the immune system of Four-Dimensional Life Forms in a dilemma of no-win choices. Conversely, it also highlights the critical importance of enhancing the immune system’s capacity for accurate identification.  

### On Freedom: The Semantic Polysemy of Universal Values  
Following the French Revolution, the triad of "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité" (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) gradually became a cornerstone of universally recognized values. These words stir profound emotional resonance in most people, yet few pause to consider their semantic multiplicity. What others mean by "liberty" may differ entirely from one’s own understanding. This ambiguity is precisely what grants such terms their broad appeal—particularly the word "liberty" itself. In French, *Liberté* (corresponding to "Liberty" in English) specifically denotes freedom from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one’s way of life, behavior, or political views—a concept distinct from the more general "Freedom." Fundamentally, unrestrained individual desires for freedom run counter to the evolutionary laws of life. Life evolves toward order, whereas unbridled freedom tends toward chaos. For high-dimensional life, collective freedom is the prerequisite for individual freedom; the price of collective freedom is that each constituent part surrenders a portion of its own freedom to sustain cooperation.  

A marvel of evolutionary philosophy lies in this paradox: when each constituent part sacrifices some freedom to enable the ascension of a high-dimensional life form, both the high-dimensional entity and its individual components attain the greatest possible freedom. Once individual aspirations align with the needs of group cooperation, both the individual and the collective achieve boundless freedom—constrained only by their shared values and moral frameworks. In this state, "acting as one wills" naturally serves to uphold these frameworks. Conversely, if individuals frantically pursue immediate personal freedom while disregarding morality and law, descending into a Hobbesian Jungle State, most will lose far more freedom than they gain, living in constant fear and precarity.  

Dimensional Ascension toward true freedom, elegance, and beauty is the deepest longing inscribed in humanity’s evolutionary history. Thus, genuine freedom belongs to the symbiotic life form as a whole. Individual freedom lies in one’s ability to fully exercise their talents and contribute to the collective freedom of the symbiotic entity, deriving joy from such contributions. In this sense, individuals act freely in their "doing as they will." Woodrow Wilson articulates a similar view in *The New Freedom*:  

> "I have long had an image in my mind of what constitutes liberty. Suppose that I were building a great piece of powerful machinery, and suppose that I should so awkwardly and unskilfully assemble the parts of it that every time one part tried to move it would be interfered with by the others, and the whole thing would buckle up and be checked. Liberty for the several parts would consist in the best possible assembling and adjustment of them all, would it not? If you want the great piston of the engine to run with absolute freedom, give it absolutely perfect alignment and adjustment with the other parts of the engine, so that it is free, not because it is let alone or isolated, but because it has been associated most skilfully and carefully with the other parts of the great structure."  

True freedom pertains to Four-Dimensional—and even higher-dimensional—life forms. Confining freedom to the individual or Three-Dimensional Life Forms is, to a degree, anti-freedom and reflects a Grabbing Tendency. [The pursuit of freedom for high-dimensional life forms is both the baseline and guarantee for individual freedom to reach its maximum potential; this is the root of genuine free thought.]() Regrettably, few truly grasp this principle today. Instead, many individuals and nations exploit distorted conceptions of freedom to engage in moral coercion.  

### Mutual Suspicion Induced by Hypocrisyism  
One reason Hypocrisyism is so insidious is its ability to incite mutual suspicion. To guard against a small minority of Hypocrisyists (deceivers), people are forced to adopt a stance of universal distrust, questioning all motives, and preemptive action. By the later stages of the French Revolution, society descended into a cycle of suspicion and counter-suspicion. Among the monarchy, royalists, constitutionalists, Girondins, Jacobins, Thermidorians, and subdivisions within the Jacobins (Feuillants, Montagnards, Cordeliers/Ébérists), relationships oscillated between fragile cooperation and acute suspicion. With Hypocrisyists rampant, the populace struggled to discern virtue from vice. Class struggles devolved into factional infighting, as individuals across all strata and parties exploited power for personal gain. Those who prioritized the collective good were often branded as "uncommitted" and purged from power—either executed or marginalized. What remained were radicals convinced of their own righteousness, unwilling to compromise for consensus, alongside opportunists, gamblers, avengers, envious individuals, and usurpators.  

The relentless operation of the guillotine during the Revolution stemmed partly from these factions’ eagerness to eliminate opponents physically, driven by fear of being the next target. The Jacobins, who invoked "liberty, democracy, and fraternity" to stir the masses and exploited class conflict and hatred, themselves acted in violation of these ideals. [This was a clear case of double standards: they demanded their own freedom and authority while arbitrarily depriving others of liberty. Though they claimed virtue, their actions were arbitrary and brutal. Most lacked political competence, experience, or moral integrity.]() The will of the people was manipulated by various forces, turning them into accomplices and ultimate victims of this struggle among Hypocrisyists. Similar dynamics have recurred in many subsequent democratic movements.  

The "suspicion" poison bred by Hypocrisyism played out violently within and beyond the Jacobin factions: between Montagnards and Girondins, central and provincial governments, central authorities and特派 commissioners (special envoys), Robespierrists and Cordeliers, Montagnards and Plain faction, Robespierrists and Ébérists, Robespierrists and Thermidorians, and between revolutionary masses and the revolutionary government. In every such rivalry, suspicion festered—any rumor, whether baseless or grounded, became a pretext for annihilation, as each side feared being outmaneuvered.  

The exploited classes’ resentment is understandable, yet their true enemies often wore masks of Hypocrisyism. Unclear on whom to oppose, they channeled their anger at perceived injustice while the real culprits—ambitious Hypocrisyists reaping immense benefits—posed as allies. Even within their own ranks, they were misled by Hypocrisyists, becoming unwitting accomplices. [Their true adversary is the gene of Hypocrisyism, regardless of class or origin—internal or external. Yet they remained unaware, allowing their real enemies to manipulate them as pawns.]()  

Hypocrisyism utterly erodes the precious trust between individuals, breeding "suspicion"—a toxin to mutual cooperation. Those who do not "suspicion" fall prey to Hypocrisyists, while even virtuous individuals are forced to suspect one another, severely undermining the density and depth of cooperation. In extreme cases, it turns partners into enemies, plotting against one another.

**Mutual Suspicion: A Moral and Legal Quagmire in Modern Society**  

Mutual suspicion has become a profound moral and legal dilemma in modern society. The Rashomon-like incidents it triggers often disrupt or even invert the Virtue Selection mechanism—the systematic process of rewarding Virtue and punishing Evil. Take sexual harassment cases as an example: typically, we tend to side with women and condemn harassers. Yet real-life scenarios frequently involve plot twists: women may weaponize claims of harassment to extort benefits, and when unsuccessful, retaliate with false accusations. Due to the difficulty of evidence collection and insufficient proof, the truth often sinks without a trace. Since both parties may be performing or embodying Hypocrisyism, such cases fall into a classic trap of mutual suspicion. The public tends to take sides based on personal biases, making arbitrary judgments through speculation rather than factual analysis. No legal system, however well-designed, can fully resolve such issues—hypocrites always find ways to exploit institutional boundaries. The result is severe, even total, damage to the Virtue Selection mechanism, akin to the fatal immune system dysfunction caused by cancer cells in the human body. Some naively believe that perfect institutions will constrain hypocrites into acting "virtuously." But in reality, the infiltration of Hypocrisyism can pervert any system: through institutional selection, surviving hypocrites adeptly adapt to institutional boundaries, rendering rigid rules ineffective against them while allowing them to harm others.  

For instance, during the early French Revolution, the Jacobins established a precedent of executions without trial to more efficiently punish greedy aristocrats. Many decadent nobles and clergy were cunning and deeply hidden; individual trials were time-consuming, and evidence was often lacking. This "chemotherapy-like" mass punishment seemed a life-saving measure against the "cancer" of privilege. Yet such methods were eventually co-opted by hypocrites: over 80 members of Robespierre’s faction were later executed without evidence, accused of plotting dictatorship. The disunity of the French people before the Revolution was already evident—a central theme of Tocqueville’s *The Old Regime and the Revolution*. The sale of official titles, a prime early catalyst of the Revolution, was a self-destructive practice. It eroded the honor and responsibility of the old nobility while creating hypocritical new elites, exacerbating internal conflicts. This mirrors the "shared pitfalls" of Emperor Wu of Han’s era, marking a turning point in the decline of both great empires.  

Tocqueville records a secret report by Turgot to the king before the Revolution: "The nation is a society of loosely connected, distinct estates—a society of people who rarely interact and act in their own self-interest. There is no sense of common interest. Villages and cities are as disconnected as the districts they belong to. Even in essential public works, they cannot reach consensus. Amidst endless struggles of greed and ambition, the king must decide everything, or his delegates must." Grabbing and internal strife inevitably corrode cooperation, and hypocrisy makes these wounds harder to heal—they fester and worsen. In humanity’s future, we will continue to pay a bloody price for the proliferation of Hypocrisyism.

## The Lack of Rigorous Theory: A Root Cause of Revolutionary Tragedy  

As emphasized throughout this book, "Virtue and Evil" here are defined by Adversarial Evolution, not traditional morality. Hypocrisyism, too, transcends conventional hypocrisy. For example, while I admire Marat’s courage, selflessness, and advocacy for the vulnerable, from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, I classify him as a hypocrite. His understanding of Virtue and justice was skewed: though he defended his own vision of good, his methods were brutal and one-sided, often veering into the opposite of justice.  

The French Revolution was a "fascinating" revolution. Every faction claimed to champion justice, moral superiority, and the "right side of history." Yet nearly all factions interpreted justice through the lens of self-interest. They argued "rationally," refused to yield, and grew increasingly radical—eventually resorting to violence against opposing voices. We cannot fault the masses, who endured hunger, oppression, and ignorance, inflamed by蛊惑 and radicalism, for failing to remain rational or self-reflective. Nor can we urge greedy nobles and monarchs to recognize their self-destruction, or expect hypocrites to overcome their psychological obsessions with grabbing. These outcomes, under the evolutionary conditions of the time, were both contingent and inevitable. As I have said: benevolent kings perish, upright individuals are wronged, moderate voices are silenced—history selects its actors, a tragic product of evolution.  

Rousseau’s theories were immature because they lacked rigorous reasoning; they exploited the masses’ visceral desire to resist oppression. Phrases like "natural rights," though stirring, are no different in logic from "divine right of kings." Later followers, such as the Jacobins, parroted these slogans to morally justify violence—e.g., "Is freedom wrong?"—as if any action became legitimate under its banner. This dogmatic mimicry of theory has recurred in China’s Confucian governance and later cultural revolutions. Everyone interprets liberty and equality through their own lens; what they truly pursue is their own liberty and equality. The immaturity of such theories left the Revolution directionless, with no clear vision of its end. As a police report in late March 1794 noted: "I do not know what this will all lead to. People denounce the two Revolutionary Committees, so we suspect them. People denounce the Revolutionary Army, and now it is dissolved. The term 'revolution' seems to mean something that opposes everything."  

This was retribution for the hypocrisy of the nobility and royalty—their ancestors’ creation of injustice, their oppression and exploitation of the people, returned doubly to their descendants, to their own genes. The method was violent, irrational, and bloody—a consequence of their ancestors’ genes lacking "foresightedness." Only when a broader public understands these evolutionary principles can the foundation for solving such issues be laid. Political education for the masses and value guidance by public intellectuals are critical. Only when the people grasp the nature and harm of Hypocrisyism, enhance their ability to discern Virtue and Evil, adopt cooperative attitudes of tolerance, accountability, and mutual benefit, and develop foresight to see long-term interests—only then will the stage for hypocrites finally collapse, and civilization achieve genuine progress.  

Notably, while I critique the French Revolution, I do not deny its value. Its motives were progressive, especially its legacy of rationality. Its trajectory aligned with capitalist development, and the French people demonstrated self-correction, ultimately establishing a consensus on democratic republicanism—a remarkable achievement. Yet the Revolution’s process and outcome exacted a heavy toll. It sowed doubt about liberty and equality, paving the way for dictatorship and restoration, setting back substantive democracy and republicanism for years.  

## The Usurpation Strategies of High-Order Hypocrites (Optional Reading)  

Exploiting and inciting the masses to seize power is an age-old tactic. Plato and Aristotle, living over two millennia ago, already saw through these maneuvers, terming it "tyranny." The French Revolution bore clear traces of this—it was neither the first nor the last such event. Let us examine the political theories of Plato, Aristotle, and their intellectual legacy, which remain relevant to us today.  

Tyrants emerge from the common people. In their early stages, they present themselves as protectors, leading the masses against injustices inflicted by the elite. History confirms this: most tyrants rise as "champions of the people," winning trust by attacking prominent figures. Reflecting on world history from the French Revolution to World War II through the lens of these ancient political insights, one cannot help but marvel at their prescience.

### Squandering Others’ Resources for Personal Gain

Both Plato and Aristotle observed that before ascending to power, tyrants would always adopt a posture of protecting the interests of the common people and courting their favor. Plato noted that in their early career, tyrants necessarily wore a smiling face for all, greeted everyone cordially, and refrained from assuming the airs of a tyrant. They would make numerous public and private promises to the populace—such as exempting the poor from debts, redistributing land to supportive citizens and followers—creating an impression of approachability. Aristotle observed that Greek tyrants typically professed hostility toward the wealthy to gain the trust of the common masses. Dionysius of Syracuse, for instance, laid the groundwork for his tyranny by denouncing the wealthy, including Daphnaios; by positioning himself as an adversary of the propertied class, he was embraced by the common people as a genuine democrat.  

Why would tyrants go to such lengths to court the relatively poor commoners rather than other groups? There are at least three reasons:  

### 1. "Benefiting Others at the Expense of Third Parties"  
First, tyrants do not use their own resources to assist the common people. Instead, they "spend others' resources," relying ultimately on public funds derived from fellow citizens—or even slander and extortion against wealthier individuals. Aristophanes (c. 446–385 BCE), the great Athenian playwright, satirizes this in his comedy *The Knights*. The play mocks how Greek tyrants, through such base tactics of currying favor with the masses, rise to become "the greatest savior of all humanity," "the most eminent figure in Greece," and sole holders of civic power. In the play, the servant Paphlagon (whose name, "the Boiling One," symbolizes the tyrant’s ability to inflame popular passions) boasts to his master Demos: "Demos, is there any citizen who loves you more than I? First, when I managed your household, how much wealth did I collect and deposit in your treasury? Some I compelled to give, some I squeezed by the throat, others I simply asked—all to please you, disregarding public opinion." The name "Demos" (from the Greek word for "the people") refers to a deaf old man in the play, symbolizing the Athenian commoners’ lack of political acumen. Paphlagon, the leather-seller, is a literary portrait of Cleon, a contemporary Athenian "demagogue" also from a leather-working background. During his rule, Cleon, in the name of "the people," slandered wealthy nobles, amassed funds to ingratiate himself with the masses, and embezzled these public resources—"appropriating the money before it was even distributed," as Aristophanes puts it. Through the voice of the play’s upright character, the Sausage-Seller, Aristophanes mocks: "Demos, this is nothing extraordinary—I could do the same for you: just seize others’ bread and present it to you. Let me remind you: this man does not love you. He harbors ill intent, merely warming himself by your fire." By using others’ resources and property to win favor without spending a single coin of their own, these figures become "saviors of the people" and can boast to the ignorant masses: "Demos, is there any citizen who loves you more than I?" This is a lucrative enterprise with no cost—why not attempt it, if one is unburdened by shame?  

Moreover, the economic poverty of the lower classes makes them more easily swayed by the short-term benefits offered by tyrants. This is the core reason tyrants seek to court the lower strata.  

The act of "benefiting others at the expense of third parties" is a phenomenon worthy of deeper analysis. From the perspective of **Adversarial Evolution**, it unfolds as follows: Tyrant A, by grabbing resources from the nobility B, provides aid to the poor C. In essence, A and C form an alliance (with C being a large group due to the numerical majority of the poor, thus making the alliance powerful), and together they grab resources from class B. The ultimate outcome is that A becomes the new privileged class, B is eliminated, C gains short-term benefits, and after laboring to help A destroy B, C is then exploited by A even more ruthlessly. Notably, this system generates no **Cooperative Dividend**; instead, it results in massive internal损耗 between the noble class B and the poor class C.  

### 2. Mobilizing "The People" Lacking Political Foresight  
Second, in the eras of Plato and Aristotle, the lower classes lacked political experience and foresight, making them more easily manipulated by tyrants than the nobility. Tyrants first seized power in the name of "the people’s interests," then governed in the name of "representing the people." Aristotle writes in *Politics* that "demagogues" brought all matters before the assembly, substituting the authority of law with the decrees of the masses. Once the masses’ representatives held power, they claimed to act on the masses’ will; having manipulated the masses, they rose to dominate state affairs. Ruling autocratically in the name of the people is yet another cost-free, profitable enterprise for tyrants.  

### 3. Eliminating Intellectuals and Implementing Mass Stupefaction  
Third, in Plato and Aristotle’s time, commoners, lacking the material and spiritual resources to pursue independence and freedom compared to the nobility and the virtuous, were easier to subjugate and less likely to resist. Aristotle observed that Greek tyrants often exiled nobles, viewing them as rivals whose presence at home threatened their power. Plato further noted that "it is the tyrant’s habit to never employ individuals with self-respect and independent will. In his eyes, such qualities belong exclusively to rulers; if others claim dignity and act independently, this offends his own dignity and freedom. Thus, tyrants detest those who challenge their authority"—and may even turn against past allies and benefactors who helped them seize power. For while nearly every citizen may wish to overthrow the tyrant, only these allies and benefactors possess the capability to do so.  

Plato’s *Republic* contains a precise description:  
> Therefore, he [the tyrant] must have a sharp eye to discern who is brave, noble-hearted, wise, or wealthy. His misfortune is to be fated to be the enemy of these individuals, eliminating them until none remain in the city—whether he wills it or not, he must do this...  

This is the root of the **Reverse Selection** phenomenon that many virtuous individuals find difficult to comprehend. History, as always, repeats itself.  

### Democracy Elects Autocracy; Minor Virtue Conceals Great Evil—The Political Ponzi Scheme  
Political forces that imposed terrible authoritarian rule—such as the Jacobins during the French Revolution, Italy’s National Fascist Party, and Germany’s Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers’ Party)—often rose to power under the banners of "popular democracy" or "the people’s interests." Their leaders were eager to fashion themselves as saviors of the masses. If we examine only their early rhetoric and public image, we might easily feel favorable toward them and become their supporters.  

Paul Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in Nazi Germany, declared: "May the fire of passion burn forever, granting us warmth and light, and creating the art of modern political propaganda. It is deeply rooted in the people, emerging from them, and must constantly trace back to its sources and strength. Taking power with rifles may be effective, but a better way is to win the hearts of the people."  

Without exception, these hypocrites eventually acted in direct opposition to their own propaganda. They coerced and incited their supporters into collective grabbing behaviors—such as anti-Semitism and racism—and initially achieved apparent "successes," seemingly seizing great benefits for their group. Yet, without exception, the subsequent outcome was profound suffering inflicted on both other groups and their own.  

These tyrants are, in essence, high-level hypocrites. They exploit humanity’s millennia-old, unevolved moral sensibilities and virtue-evil judgments, using small gestures to achieve grand ends, dismantling their supports once they have crossed the river, and ultimately succeeding through the PUA (Pick-Up Artist) manipulation of the masses.

I refer to this pattern as the "political Ponzi scheme." In fact, the Ponzi scheme is the classic blueprint for incubating all great evils—whether in finance, romance, or politics. Vigilance against Ponzi schemes is of immense benefit to personal life, society, and the trajectory of human history.
