# The Evolutionary Crisis We Face  

## The Lagging of Human Genetic Mechanisms Behind Environmental Changes Induced by Cooperative Ascension  

As we have seen, the moral mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, which evolved from ancient times and supported humanity’s prosperity, has failed to keep pace with the complex situations humans currently need to address. [This instinctive judgment of Virtue and Evil has increasingly been fitted and exploited by Hypocrisyists. So much so that moral judgments sometimes not only fail to achieve the results of Virtue Selection but instead backfire.]() A critical fact we must recognize is that for nearly 2 million years after Homo erectus, accounting for 99% of that period, humans lived in Pleistocene hunter-gatherer societies. [In other words, during this 99% of the time that shaped human genes, the size of each human community remained small—generally within 100 individuals, and often only 30 or fewer for most of the period.]()  

However, in the final 1% of this timeframe, human populations surged exponentially, with the size of individual communities growing dramatically. Small communities merged into larger ones; larger communities formed tribes, and multiple tribes coalesced into ethnic groups and kingdoms. Even more remarkably, figures like Qin Shi Huang unified vast territories of feudal states into enormous empires. Over just 10,000 years, human communities rapidly expanded from 100 individuals to tens of millions. [Yet within this brief 1% span—approximately 10,000 years—human genetic evolution has been minimal. Our genetic mechanisms and instincts remain better suited to the social environment of hunter-gatherer societies. Thus, we can no longer rely on naturally evolved genes and instincts to directly solve our current problems.]()  

With the sharp increase in human population, per capita arable land has dwindled, intensifying geopolitical conflicts over resources like land. For example, during the Spring and Autumn Period, many vassal states had vast "uninhabited zones" between them, as their own farmland was more than sufficient. By the Warring States Period, however, border disputes between states multiplied—such as a major war between Wu and Chu in the late Spring and Autumn Period, which escalated from minor conflicts between border residents. Since then, competition among human groups has grown increasingly intense, shifting toward Grabbingism and reaching a fever pitch. [Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, which primarily addresses individual-to-individual cooperation, has never handled large-scale group competition. It is ill-equipped to resolve issues of group cooperation—a problem of Group Grabbingism repeatedly discussed in this book.]()  

On the other hand, as borders between nations and ethnic groups blur, the punitive power of traditional moral mechanisms against Evil has weakened. [In the past, under "small states with small populations" where communities rarely interacted, a person who committed wrongdoing in their own state would face severe social ostracism, drastically reducing their fitness. Today, however, one can flee to another state under a new identity and rebuild their life.]() Take Wu Qi, one of the founders of Legalism. To advance his political career, he spent vast sums of money seeking opportunities, only to squander his wealth without securing a position, drawing mockery and slander from his hometown. Enraged, Wu Qi killed over 30 slanderers, fled, and later obtained a generalship in the State of Lu by killing his wife to prove his loyalty. In a "small state with small populations" era, he would likely have been rejected by foreign states and struggled to survive in his hometown.  

This large-community state has pushed human society into a "stranger social interaction model," where in cities, even neighbors may be strangers, and only frequent acquaintances have mutual understanding. This stands in stark contrast to clan societies of old, where everyone knew one another—even the deeds of each other’s ancestors. Under this "stranger social interaction" model, the efficacy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism has been greatly diminished, Virtue Selection mechanisms have been disrupted, and the difficulty of practicing Hypocrisyism has plummeted.  

In summary, the flaws of old moral values, amid humanity’s new Adversarial Evolution environment and the process of Cooperative Ascension, have spawned two pressing issues: Group Grabbingism and Hypocrisyism.

## The Prolonging of the Grabbing Chain  

[Moreover, the more complex and refined division of labor accompanying Cooperative Ascension has diversified forms of Evil, making them harder to detect. Grabbing and altruism have become increasingly difficult to measure, and Hypocrisyism and genuine Virtue ever harder to distinguish.]()[A well-known saying captures this: "When the chain of Evil is long enough, everyone along it feels innocent."]() This phenomenon—committing Evil yet feeling blameless—often manifests in corrupt officials and financial "elites." [Though they gain enormous benefits through Grabbing, victims are often unaware, and identifying the perpetrator remains elusive. Such Grabbing is indirect, covert, and may span lengthy periods.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0de7e2b-b6f7-472a-82de-748a52385993" /></p>  

Yuval Noah Harari vividly describes this dilemma in *21 Lessons for the 21st Century*: The modern globalized world inherently features [highly fragmented and complex cause-and-effect relationships](). For instance, I might stay quietly at home, never harming anyone, yet to leftist activists, I am complicit with the Israeli military and West Bank settlers. To socialists, my comfortable life is built on the backs of child laborers in Third World sweatshops. When God decreed "Thou shalt not steal," theft meant physically taking something not yours. Today, however, meaningful discussions of theft involve entirely different scenarios.  

Suppose I invest $10,000 in a large petrochemical company’s stock, earning 5% annual returns. The company’s high profits stem from evading external costs—directly dumping toxic waste into nearby rivers, disregarding severe harm to local water supplies, public health, and ecosystems. With vast resources, it hires legions of lawyers to avoid legal liability and political lobbyists to block environmental regulations. Can we accuse this company of "stealing a river"? What is my role? I never broke into anyone’s home or took money from a wallet. Unaware of the company’s profit methods—even forgetting it exists in my portfolio—am I also guilty of theft? How can we ensure moral conduct without knowing all relevant facts?  

We might invoke the "morality of intentions" to evade this question: what matters is intent, not actions or consequences. Yet in this interconnected world, the most critical moral duty is to "know." History’s gravest crimes arise not only from hatred and greed but from ignorance and apathy. Elegant British ladies, never setting foot in Africa or the Caribbean, funded the transatlantic slave trade by purchasing stocks and bonds on the London Stock Exchange. Then, at 4 p.m., they sipped tea sweetened with sugar from hellish slave plantations—entirely oblivious.  

## The Decline of Naive Morality (Intuitive Morality)  

Our earlier discussions of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, the origins of Virtue, and humanity’s development might mislead readers into thinking this book argues that fixing morality alone solves all problems. In reality, these discussions aim to trace moral origins and provide a clearer definition and reasoning process. The morality formed by the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism—what helped humans transition from a life of foraging and raw food to one of comfort and prosperity—we hereafter term "naive morality" or "intuitive morality." This chapter addresses the crisis facing this naive morality. [The two foundations of stable Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—the Virtue Selection mechanism, undermined by Hypocrisyism; and the Group Selection mechanism, eroded by Group Grabbingism.]()  

Since the rise of Hypocrisyism and Group Grabbingism, humanity has not only struggled to "progress" but often faces regression. The foundation of human Virtue Selection—where Virtuous individuals are frequently subject to Reverse Selection—has been gradually dismantled. The Virtue Selection mechanism, which enabled humanity to succeed and rise above other species, now teeters on collapse. [To grasp the gravity of this crisis, we must deeply understand, through prior chapters, the critical role of Virtue Selection in sustaining human society, as well as the Cooperative Dividend, the origins of morality, humanity’s advantages over other animals, and the origins of human civilization. All now face the risk of "decline."]()  

Thus, though Confucius long ago recognized the decay of ethics and the collapse of ritual propriety, advocating the restoration of Zhou rites to address societal issues, we can be certain we cannot return to that era or those social relations. [For the new Adversarial Evolution environment shaped by humanity’s Cooperative Ascension has drastically transformed traditional social relations.]()  

## Laozi—Perhaps the First Prophet to Grasp It All

Having previously discussed Confucianism and Legalism, we now turn our attention to Laozi. Among these, Laozi’s philosophy is the most profound. I generally do not refer to Laozi’s philosophy as "Taoism," for the term "Taoism" has been severely distorted by later generations, even degenerating into an arcane and affectation-ridden doctrine that scarcely reflects the essence of Laozi’s thought. Moving forward, we will explore Laozi’s philosophy through the lens of Adversarial Evolution, a perspective that may reveal insights closer to the core of his ideas than any previous approach.  

### Non-Action Governance  
Though Confucius once sought guidance from Laozi, he failed to grasp Laozi’s Way. Confucius likened Laozi to an unfathomable dragon: *"Birds I know can fly; fish I know can swim; beasts I know can run. For those that run, nets can be set; for those that swim, lines can be cast; for those that fly, arrows can be shot. But the dragon—of it I know not how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to heaven. Today I beheld Laozi, and he is like a dragon!"* Confucius later sighed, *"If one could hear the Way in the morning, even dying that evening would suffice,"* revealing the exalted status of the Way in his mind. Laozi left few written works, and even details of his birth and nationality remain unclear; the *Tao Te Ching* is nearly our sole window into his thought. The term "Non-Action" (wú wéi) appears most frequently in the *Tao Te Ching*, as seen in such passages:  

> "Thus the Sage manages affairs through Non-Action and practices instruction without words."  
> "By acting through Non-Action, all under heaven may be governed."  
> "When loving the people and governing the state, can one do so without contrivance? When illuminating all directions, can one practice Non-Action?"  
> "The Way always acts through Non-Action, yet leaves nothing undone. If the lords and kings can uphold this, all things will transform of their own accord."  
> "The highest Virtue acts through Non-Action and has no ulterior purpose; the lesser Virtue acts with purpose and has ulterior motives."  
> "The world’s softest thing can gallop through the world’s hardest. That which has no substance can enter where there are no crevices—thus I know the benefit of Non-Action. The instruction without words and the benefit of Non-Action are rarely matched under heaven."  
> "In pursuit of learning, one gains daily; in pursuit of the Way, one loses daily. Lose and lose again, until Non-Action is reached. Through Non-Action, nothing remains undone."  
> "By my Non-Action, the people transform themselves; by my valuing stillness, the people rectify themselves; by my doing nothing, the people enrich themselves; by my having no desires, the people return to simplicity."  
> "He who acts fails; he who grasps loses. Thus the Sage, through Non-Action, fails not; through non-grasping, loses not."  

The *Tao Te Ching* repeatedly emphasizes that Non-Action surpasses action, and inactivity surpasses busyness. (Of course, there is a possibility that the *Tao Te Ching* has been altered by later hands—for example, the Guodian version of the text contains fewer references to "Non-Action.") Does Laozi’s doctrine then border on passivity, or even reactionarism?  

<p align="center"><img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c754c086-5f1e-4fc5-a4cb-9f5eb4ae47df" />  
</p>  

In truth, it does not. [If the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were prophets because they recognized what was good and strove to preserve it, Laozi was a prophet of a different kind—he understood how things could grow worse, and he even foresaw that this degenerative evolutionary trend would be difficult to reverse. Thus, his core idea was Non-Action—preserving the past.](()) He exhorted people that by collectively practicing Non-Action and maintaining the status quo, they would secure the best "future." Laozi’s "Non-Action" does not mean doing nothing—refusing to cook, for instance, would lead to starvation by the next day. Nor does it mean shirking effort, which would invite elimination. Rather, it approximates avoiding cunning, excessive desire, rashness, and constant attempts to alter established mechanisms—for people are unprepared to do so.  

### Small States with Small Populations  
Laozi’s philosophy is not mere metaphysics or abstruse theory. It can be understood within the framework of Adversarial Evolution. This "Non-Action" concretely manifests in Laozi’s ideal of "Small States with Small Populations." He writes in the *Tao Te Ching*:  

*"Small states with few people. Let them have implements of ten or a hundred uses but not use them. Let the people value their lives and not migrate far. Though they have boats and carriages, they have no need to ride them; though they have armor and weapons, they have no need to display them. Let the people return to knot-tying for records. Let them find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their homes comfortable, their customs enjoyable. Neighboring states may overlook one another, and the sound of cocks crowing and dogs barking may be heard between them, but the people will grow old and die without ever visiting one another."*  

This is Laozi’s vision of "Small States with Small Populations, where people grow old and die without interacting." The period Laozi describes corresponds to the Spring and Autumn Period, when vast stretches of land lay uncultivated. According to *Records of the Reigns of Emperors and Kings*, during the Xia and Shang dynasties, there were 1,800 polities under heaven, each averaging just 1,300 people. Song Zhenhao, in *A History of Social Life in the Xia and Shang Dynasties*, estimates an average population of 1,500. At the start of the Zhou dynasty, there were still over a thousand polities; Xue Yong notes that "these thousand-odd states were mostly clustered in the narrow Central Plains, with each averaging just a few thousand people." Why did these small states remain "unvisited until death"? Economically self-sufficient, they had no need for interaction. This "no interaction until death" may be difficult for modern Chinese to imagine, given the remoteness of the Spring and Autumn Period and the paucity of records. A comparison to Europe’s manorial system during the Middle Ages, however, may clarify the concept.  

### The Benefits of Small States with Small Populations  
The Zhou system was an era of small communities. States were modest in scale, ranging from a few thousand to ten thousand people. Within these states, further enfeoffment created smaller societies of a few hundred people—akin to large villages. Such societies typically boasted high levels of trust. In these close-knit communities, everyone knew one another, bound by distant or near kinship. As Mr. Qin Hui observes, in such a "rational economic man" context, one had to act with integrity and diligence. With repeated interactions ("iterated games") as the norm, people avoided short-term Grabbingism; social mores remained simple.  

Teacher Zhang Hongjie recounts growing up in a rural village, where compared to cities, human warmth thrived. When visiting a neighbor, one naturally joined them for meals; when beans or cucumbers ripened in a garden, they were freely shared with neighbors without ceremony. His mother, a primary school teacher receiving state wages and lacking a vegetable plot, often found baskets of fresh vegetables at their door each morning—left anonymously. In such rural societies, one’s "humanity"—their reputation—determined their status and prospects. Even if someone committed a wrong and fled to another state, the "no interaction until death" norm meant that a stranger in a village would be closely scrutinized, regardless of their attempts to integrate.  

Thus, in the natural state of Small States with Small Populations, [the "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" mechanism encoded in human genes operates with high efficiency. In such societies, evil is punished and struggles to spread, while virtue receives greater support. Over time, this dynamic strengthens, culminating in human groups with increasingly higher cooperation degrees.](()) [Moreover, within this multi-group system of "no interaction until death," Group Grabbingism is less likely to take root. The exploitation and lengthy Grabbing chains born of large-scale, multi-level division of labor—along with the problem of hidden Grabbing—are also less prone to emerge. Groups with excessive Hypocrisyism are quickly naturally selected out. Many "progress-related ills" of later human societies are thus avoided.](())  

Laozi (or perhaps a group of thinkers, as evidence suggests the *Tao Te Ching* was not the work of a single author) was a figure of singular wisdom and foresight. His *Tao Te Ching* abounds with dialectical thinking, and his governance philosophy reflects his awareness of the manifold issues arising from humanity’s rapid social development. He knew that once Pandora’s box was opened, it could not be closed. As early as the Spring and Autumn Period, he incisively declared: *"Abandon wisdom and discard cleverness, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon hypocrisy and discard deception, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion. Abandon craftiness and discard profit-seeking, and there will be no thieves or robbers"* (Guodian version of the *Tao Te Ching*). With piercing insight, he identified the era’s societal ills as stemming from intellectual sophistry, hypocrisy, deception, craftiness, and profit-seeking. He advocated a return to humanity’s natural social state.  

Small States with Small Populations, Laozi believed, represented the natural state best suited to humanity’s genetic makeup. In small states, where nearly everyone knew one another, good and bad deeds were transparent. This enabled the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism strategy to function efficiently, making Hypocrisyism untenable: deception might work temporarily, but not over a lifetime, let alone across generations. In this context, groups with high cooperation degrees survived, gradually weeding out those with lower cooperation degrees. Though this process sometimes involved bloodshed, it rarely resulted in genocide; weaker groups typically withered away or self-destructed. High-cooperation groups expanded into depopulated territories without waging large-scale, intentional wars. Within this dynamic, groups and their genetic cultures with low internal cooperation degrees faded into obscurity.  

[Why do Hypocrisyism and Grabbingism perish more readily in small groups? Both Hypocrisyist and Grabbingist individuals leech off others. In a small group, once they have Reverse Selected the limited number of virtuous individuals, only Hypocrisyists and Grabbingists remain. The cooperative dividends they generate are minimal, while their Grabbing Deficit is immense. As human individuals are vulnerable, the loss of cooperative dividends leaves them ill-equipped to survive in the natural world of "survival of the fittest." In contrast, within vast empires—where the initial number of virtuous individuals is large and technology advanced—it takes far longer for the group to reach a state of critically low cooperative dividends, enabling Hypocrisyists and Grabbingists to persist and spread further. Consequently, when such groups perish, their destructive impact is far greater in scale and scope.](()) [In essence, Small States with Small Populations slow the spread of Hypocrisyist and Grabbingist genes. By weeding out these "cancer cells" early through small-group selection, they prevent the incubation of greater evils.](())

### The Spring and Autumn Period: Scattered Settlements and Primitive Cooperation  

During the Spring and Autumn Period, the various states were not contiguous; there were no clearly defined borders between them. When the Zhou Kings enfeoffed vassal lords, they dispatched their brothers, nephews, and other kin to establish colonial outposts across vast, uninhabited lands. Thus, prior to the Spring and Autumn Period, the vassal states were isolated points rather than contiguous territories. Between these points lay wilds inhabited by nomadic peoples, hence the term "a mix of Chinese and non-Chinese peoples" (华夷杂处). These nomadic groups were not confined to the northern fringes of the Central Plains as they would later be; they dwelt directly in the wilds between the Central Plains states. For example, between the states of Song and Zheng lay "six uninhabited settlements in the interstices" (隙地六邑)—an area equivalent to three modern counties—left untouched for a full six hundred years. Most of China’s territory remained undeveloped prior to the Spring and Autumn Period.  

With populations scattered, small in scale, and societal surplus limited, the primary contradiction of human survival remained rooted in the struggle against nature. The gains of Group Grabbingism were minimal, while its costs were high; conflicts were largely confined to territorial or reproductive resource disputes. These conflicts were neither excessively intense nor rife with scheming or irreconcilable enmity. Laozi’s advocacy of *Non-Action Governance* (无为而治) thus aimed to curb the incipient trend of Group Grabbingism.  

In the centuries following Laozi, however, inter-group contradictions in human society grew increasingly acute. By the Warring States Period, with the widespread use of iron tools, instances of Group Grabbingism surged geometrically. Crude estimates suggest that over 2.6 million soldiers perished in wars, accounting for roughly one-tenth of the total population at the time. Countless commoners were massacred in sieges or displaced by war. Human society had not yet developed institutional mechanisms for inter-group coexistence—though the ritual of war under the *Zhou Rites* (周礼), as a form of *Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism* (群体好善疾恶主义), extended the individual *Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism* (好善疾恶主义)—its regulatory power was insufficient. By the late Warring States Period, the ritual of war was wantonly trampled upon by various states, and figures like Duke Xiang of Song, who adhered to the old system, became objects of ridicule. Benevolent and ritualistic states like Lu and Teng were annexed by larger powers.  

[Laozi’s philosophy thus preemptively guarded against both Hypocrisyism (伪善主义) and Group Grabbingism—two of the gravest maladies to afflict later human societies. This makes him a prophetic visionary of humanity.]() Human societal development has outpaced genetic evolution by leaps and bounds. [Modern humans’ genes remain rooted in the primitive clan societies of the past.]() The mechanisms encoded in human genes are inadequate to address the complexities of the contemporary world—a likely intrinsic cause of humanity’s potential demise. [Translating this into AI terminology: the innate virtue-and-evil judgment mechanisms expressed in human genes, which were "pre-trained" through millions of years of group competition, have been overfitted by novel grabbing genes. These pre-trained mechanisms now struggle to distinguish between grabbing individuals and cooperative ones. Consequently, the *Virtue Selection Mechanism* (善择机制)—the linchpin sustaining humanity’s four-dimensional life form—has faltered.]() Maintaining the state of *Small States with Small Populations* (小国寡民) preserves the "most comfortable" state of human genes, where the *Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism* mechanism can still function effectively. [Laozi’s insight was incisive: he saw the crisis beneath superficial prosperity and regression beneath apparent progress.]() [His words are deeply dialectical. He grasped, in part, the universal principle of Adversarial Evolution. The phrase "Heaven and Earth are impartial; they treat all things as straw dogs" (天地不仁，以万物为刍狗) encapsulates this objective law of evolution. To disregard it is to invite its merciless application to humanity, as though we were no more than straw dogs.]() [The Dao is both impartial and compassionate.]()  

Is it possible for humanity to remain indefinitely in the "most comfortable" state of *Small States with Small Populations* as Laozi proposed? In truth, it is not entirely impossible. Yet, by understanding the laws of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension, we recognize that the trend toward larger-scale human cooperation and greater cooperative dividends is inevitable, driven by the currents of group competition and group selection. Humanity’s dimensional ascension, despite its hardships, confusion, and trials, will be propelled forward by the tides of history and the laws of Adversarial Evolution—just as countless life forms have traversed this path over eons. The pace of progress may, however, be tempered.

### A Summary of Evolutionary Crises  

As analyzed in the previous volume and validated by simulation programs, humanity achieved *Dimension Ascension* (维度跃升) and entered an *Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)* (进化稳定策略) through the *Virtue Selection Mechanism* (善择机制). Theoretically, entering an ESS is critical; in practice, absolute ESS states are rare. The intrinsic drive of Adversarial Evolution compels life to seek every opportunity to seize benefits from others. The greater the number of lives from which benefits are seized, and the more sophisticated the techniques of such seizure, the higher the gains. [Thus, as virtuous humans achieve greater success and their numbers grow, the potential for grabbing genes to exploit the weaknesses of this virtue also expands. Consequently, as human communities grow larger, the endogenous challenges they face will inevitably increase, not diminish. Once such exploitative techniques are invented, they become akin to a fatal "cancer cell."]()  

The moral mechanisms of the primitive *Small States with Small Populations* era are ill-equipped to address the scale of modern human communities, the complexity of labor divisions, and the intensity of group competition. As previously noted, multiple factors contribute to this: population mobility in large groups enables betrayal, free-riding, and grabbing behavior to evade moral scrutiny. The efficacy of moral reward-and-punishment mechanisms wanes, as they are easily resisted by small cliques and exploited by hypocrites. Indeed, adept hypocrites often profit from these mechanisms. With social circles expanding exponentially, individuals are no longer as familiar with neighbors and friends as their ancestors were; instead, they encounter strangers. Population mobility further benefits grabbing individuals—examples include corrupt officials like Lai Changxing and financial criminals who flee abroad for refuge. For these reasons, many "grabbing individuals" who ought to face severe punishment thrive instead. To avoid retribution and cover their tracks, they must recruit "accomplices"—such as hiring lawyers—thereby fostering new layers of hypocrisy. [This spawns an outward-spreading industrial chain of evil.]()  

When the *Virtue Selection Mechanism* is compromised and legal systems remain incomplete, society inevitably enters a phase of *Reverse Selection* (逆淘汰现象). What is more alarming is that people, unaware of this trend, passively accept or even exacerbate these "reverse selection" survival rules, accelerating the process.  

<div align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a168269-4dbd-4167-a86b-07c214f0de5f" /></div>  
<div align="center">The grabbing microcirculation environment constructed by hypocritical "tumors"</div>  

In recent years, there has been a rise in arguments for the futility or plurality of morality, particularly in discourses on gender relations and "success studies." These ideas often advocate freeing oneself from moral constraints. In essence, they align with the logic that "cutting in line is better." When cutting in line faces no condemnation, punishment, or even becomes a trend, the only losers are the sincere and trustworthy, while the ruthless thrive. Those of mixed character are compelled to awaken their own "evil" sides to survive—even as their consciences recoil.  

On the other hand, following the Neolithic Great Leap, Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution, and Information Revolution, human population has exploded. [The potential and ceiling of gains from grabbing through various means have also surged exponentially.]() With even a modicum of power, daring to engage in grabbing behavior yields significant returns—though with some risk. [From the perspective of enhancing individual fitness, such behavior often proves more advantageous than not.]() This explains why corruption is intractable, scams persistent, and exploitation recurring. [The gravest consequence, however, is not merely the suffering of the exploited or defrauded, but the entrenchment of a *Reverse Selection* evolutionary trend: the virtuous wane, and the evil wax.]()  

In fact, [the development of productive forces, the growth of societal surplus, and the inheritability of private property]() enable Grabbingism, Free-Riderism, and Hypocrisyism to pass on the advantages of immoral behavior to future generations. Lured by enormous gains, individuals take desperate risks, culminating in widespread Reverse Selection. These phenomena, depicted in countless works of fiction, provoke profound indignation.  

Moreover, as labor divisions grow more complex—relying on intricate transactional and financial systems—[the chains of interest lengthen, and grabbing methods become sophisticated and covert. The "moral" judgments encoded in human genes often struggle to discern virtue from evil.]() Exploitation of surplus value, pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes, insider trading, financial derivatives, and manipulation of stock and housing prices—these are all enduring and effective financial hypocrisy-and-grabbing strategies. Waves of "speculators" are exploited, while grabbers evade accountability. These are "progress-related ailments" accompanying humanity’s Cooperative Ascension—phenomena absent in the primitive era of *Small States with Small Populations*. [At their core, they arise because the pace of upgrading humanity’s *Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism* (合作维护机制) lags behind the pace of Cooperative Ascension.]()  

<div align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aea833c-903a-4ed3-b8c0-497b16100d17" /></div>

While humanity continues to indulge with enthusiasm in the development of science and technology, and exuberantly pursues happiness and longevity, artificial intelligence, gene editing, and quantum technology are expanding human technological capabilities into new dimensions. As humanity revels in the extraordinary enrichment of material wealth, it has overlooked that the invisible hand of the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism has been straining under the burden—the very essence that defines humanity is eroding, and the internal causes of human civilization's potential destruction are rapidly accumulating.  

Amid this process where cumulative quantitative changes in population and scientific technology have given rise to pronounced qualitative transformations, the foundational Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism of human society has failed to establish a commensurate robust framework. This is akin to installing a supersonic engine in a decrepit automobile. While people savor the thrill of hurtling forward at breakneck speed, and wallow in self-indulgence and self-satisfaction, the path ahead may already be a meticulously prepared trap set by the God of Chaos, leading straight to self-destruction.
