Due to the absence of written records, prehistoric human history can only be analyzed from an overarching perspective based on archaeological evidence, resulting in a relatively straightforward narrative. Since the invention of writing, history has become a footnote to the grand drama of human evolution. It is also from this period that humans grew increasingly impure—with the elevation of human intelligence, pretense, Hypocrisyism, and the multiplication of conflicting accounts intensified. Leafing through the thick annals of human history often moves me to tears. Enveloped by the complexity of human nature, humanity has been confused, struggled, strived, and continuously wounded. There are too many historical mists obscuring our ability to distinguish Virtue and Evil, loyalty and treachery; too many beauties we were meant to defend that we failed to protect; too many people we should have cherished and guarded that we let down. Humanity's intuitive morality faces unprecedented challenges, verging on collapse. Most of today's contradictions and crises have their roots buried deep in the long river of history. In the next two sections, we will take history as our thread and Adversarial Evolution theory as our analytical tool to re-examine the evolutionary laws hidden in the causal depths of history. We hope that through these new understandings, humanity can better grasp its own destiny.

# Purpose of the Narrative

Here, I first need to clarify the purpose of my subsequent writing. [I did not write this book to recount history itself, much less to reconstruct historical facts](). History is complex, historical figures are even more complex, and the motivations and mental processes behind these figures are yet more intricate and beyond verification. Therefore, [the focus of this book is to use historical materials to expound the major trends of historical development and underlying evolutionary logical laws within the framework of Adversarial Evolution](). This necessarily involves conjecture and one-sidedness. I strive to use logical reasoning as the main thread, with historical phenomena serving only as supplements; I hope that even if descriptions of historical facts may be biased, the logical reasoning remains rigorous. If any discrepancies are found, I welcome all corrections. 

Tocqueville, in the first paragraph of *The Old Regime and the Revolution*, reminds us: "No event, except the French Revolution, has more power to warn philosophers and statesmen to be modest, for no historical event has had deeper roots, been more thoroughly prepared, [greater yet more unpredictable]() (starting from seemingly good intentions but ending in bad outcomes). Regardless of your purpose, remember: *The Old Regime and the Revolution* is merely a case study of France. Do not make arbitrary judgments about anything." The purpose of this book aligns with Tocqueville's reminder. Although my work involves inducting simple laws from complex phenomena, and although I strive to make these laws as concise as possible, overly simplistic conclusions often become one-sided or even deviate from reality—for the objective world is shaped by the combined action of several primary causes and countless secondary causes. Therefore, all surface phenomena I will discuss should not be taken as immutable facts; only the underlying laws they contain can be considered factual. I will endeavor to sort out the most influential factors driving historical evolution. Some conjectures may have incorrect temporal or spatial sequences, but the same laws and logic have almost certainly occurred. 

We say human history is a history of a biological species, and thus it cannot be separated from the laws of Adversarial Evolution. With the lens of Adversarial Evolution, history will more easily reveal its true face to our eyes. Under the laws of Adversarial Evolution, human nature is necessarily complex, and therefore the history composed of humans is also necessarily complex. Any one-sided evaluations or post-hoc analyses only scratch the surface of events. Humanity has a natural inclination toward Virtue and a tendency toward Evil. [Evil often yields short-term benefits, while Virtue pursues long-term interests. However, short-term destruction may also strangle Virtue's long-term pursuits](). There are too many difficult trade-offs and too many无可奈何 situations. Even the greatest sages can barely break through the intellectual constraints of their time. You may call them naive or obstinate, but in most cases, we are merely criticizing from the sidelines; we are judging from a god's-eye view, and it is perhaps already difficult for us to reconstruct historical truths through post-hoc conjectures. 

I tend to believe that most individual historical choices have no optimal solution—left or right in chaotic adversarial situations may both lead to failure. The power of decision lies more in the macro environment in which historical figures are situated. The most critical determinant of this macro environment depends on the decisions of every individual within hierarchical groupings. This is influenced by the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma and involves trade-offs between long-term interests and short-term survival. For example, should a great person sacrifice their life to save a group of less great people, or preserve their life to make a more valuable sacrifice later? Only by transcending individual perspectives and adopting a long-term, holistic view can we more accurately judge what is more advantageous or disadvantageous. 

[Additionally, I personally oppose historical judgment frameworks that rely solely on moral right/wrong or outcome success/failure](). History does contain relatively inevitable laws formed by major contradictions. For instance, group adversaries drive productivity competition; productivity competition drives competition in group cooperation degrees; competition in cooperation degrees drives reforms in production relations; and reforms in production relations ultimately promote the liberation of thought, freedom, democracy, and equality. However, the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma tells us that people in complex, chaotic adversarial states have no optimal choices. [Historical figures are more like a crowd of gamblers, at the mercy of fate's compass](). Our study of these laws aims to escape such dilemmas, break free from fate's wheel, resist the chaos of the vortex, and stand at a higher level to grasp the trajectory of our own and future generations' destinies.
