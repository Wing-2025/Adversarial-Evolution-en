# Moral Instinct Remains Crucially Important

## The Other Side of *The Wealth of Nations* – *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*  
*The Wealth of Nations* is widely known for its profound economic insights, often leading people to mistakenly believe that Adam Smith's theoretical system discards moral considerations. This is far from the truth. In his other masterpiece, *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, Smith elaborates on his moral philosophy, revealing his deep and comprehensive understanding of human nature. In his later years, though Smith revised *The Wealth of Nations* extensively, he chose to keep it unpublished and even entrusted a friend to destroy it, as he felt some of his views were still immature. This act may reflect his reflections on the potential moral and ethical issues that economic theories could trigger.  

In the pages of *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, Smith regards sympathy as a universal human instinct, believing that emotional communication is an indispensable cornerstone of social life. He emphasizes that sympathy, as the most primal emotional bond in human nature, exists universally in every individual—whether a virtuous sage or a morally deficient person. This emotion not only fosters close interpersonal connections but also acts as an internal constraint, balancing individuals' boundless pursuit of wealth and reputation. Smith further points out that sympathy has the purpose of promoting mutual emotional satisfaction, enhancing goodwill and harmony among people, and serving as a vital force driving social communication. Based on this, he constructs an ethical framework encompassing justice, benevolence, and conscience, fully presenting his system of ethical thought.  

Despite Smith's profound reflections on market economics and morality, he was limited by the scientific understanding of his time and failed to sufficiently explore the roots of moral instinct deficits, particularly lacking the support of evolutionary and genetic perspectives. Re-examining *The Wealth of Nations* and *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* through the lens of evolutionary theory may allow us to gain a clearer insight into the intrinsic connections and complementarity between the two.  

[Virtue being rewarded and evil being punished is the fundamental premise and foundation for the development of human society. In primitive societies, this process was achieved through "human selection"; in the age of law, it is realized through "legal selection"; and what *The Wealth of Nations* advocates is essentially "market selection." These three forms complement each other.]()  
["Legal selection" enhances enforceability and objectivity; "human selection" fills the gaps and lags of "legal selection"; and "market selection" strengthens quantification and accuracy.]()  

Although this chapter points out the limitations and challenges of legal and market mechanisms, it by no means intends to negate their value. Instead, it aims to reaffirm that the ultimate pursuit of both law and market lies in shaping and enhancing human nature and moral instincts, rather than merely pursuing utilitarian goals. Confronted with the potential decline of moral sense, we must recognize that this not only reflects the weakening of "human selection" but also poses new challenges to the effective operation of "legal selection" and "market selection." As society becomes more complex and economic interests more concealed, the difficulty of legally defining profit-grabbing behaviors increases. Therefore, strengthening moral construction and encouraging more individuals to actively participate in institutional design and supervision have become indispensable steps in promoting social progress. Every substantial advancement in human society ultimately hinges on the level of moral instinct among individuals.  

## Moral Instinct – The Institution of Institutions, the Constitution of Constitutions  
Many people today have formed a common notion: [Institutions determine everything; all problems stem from institutional flaws. With good institutions, all issues can be resolved; if problems persist, it is because the institutions are inadequate. Moral instincts have no role to play.]() Just as behaviors under a market economy allow even the most self-interested individuals to create enormous wealth for society, this is no doubt a consequence of the distortion of Confucian moral views—rather than being misled by distorted moral concepts, it is better to outright oppose morality itself. At some point, influenced by certain ideological trends, the term "morality" has even become pejorative, associated with feudal ethics, and stigmatized. Additionally, hypocrisy and acts of exhorting virtue have further disgraced morality.  

Precisely for this reason, we must analyze and clarify, from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the true meaning of morality—specifically, the genuine connotation of "virtue in Adversarial Evolution"—and the correct way to approach morality. This book has never denied the importance of legal systems and market economic rules to human society; they are even as indispensable as moral instincts. The core argument of this book is that moral instinct is the foundation of all high-dimensional behaviors, and its role transcends that of law and market. In the next section, we will see:  

[Any group that achieves success and escapes brutal group competition will enter a "consumption period" of moral instinct. That is to say, the internal cause of a group's subsequent remarkable civilizational achievements lies in the moral instinct it initially possessed. The better the moral instinct of a nation, the more civilizational achievements it will attain. However, as the group succeeds and expands, its moral instinct is continuously depleted, inevitably leading to a period of moral decline until the collapse of the civilization.]()  

Thus, the ultimate significance of laws and institutions does not lie in achieving temporary economic prosperity or transient happiness for the people. This model of pursuing short-term social success is itself an inwardly competitive and grabbing-oriented mindset, and certain Western group-grabbing ideologies will ultimately pay the price for this short-sightedness. Of course, economic prosperity and the well-being of the people are also of great importance:  

[But what is more fundamental is the shaping of human instincts by law and market, which is the key to the long-term development and happiness of human society. We cannot rely on spontaneity to govern human society, but we must shape spontaneity.]()  

In fact, institutions are formulated by humans, and in this process, moral instincts—or more precisely, high-dimensional life instincts—are crucially important. For instance, if Adam Smith had not been a far-sighted, empathetic, and holistic thinker, constantly considering the overall social system and the future of humanity, he would not have spent time writing *The Wealth of Nations*. The prosperous scene initiated by the market economy might have emerged much later, or even failed to materialize, similar to China's past experience. In some third-world countries with low moral instincts, legal systems and market economies cannot be effectively implemented, let alone spontaneously fostering sophisticated laws and institutions. Even in the United States, a beacon of the rule of law, as the moral standards of its people continue to degrade, its once seemingly enlightened laws and institutions face enormous challenges. The earlier example of rental regulations being maliciously exploited is one such case, while issues with guns and drugs are only worsening.  

[The lower the moral average of a society, the higher its institutional costs, and the more severe the secondary crimes and bidirectional institutional dilemmas it faces.]()  

Conversely, in a society with a higher moral average, such as Singapore, it can implement institutions that completely contradict economic principles, such as the integration of the central bank and government. This is generally a大忌 in economics, as it could breed countless corrupt practices, yet Singapore has used this institution to significantly enhance national efficiency, ultimately achieving a miracle of rapid economic growth. As Chairman Mao often said: "When people are good, everything is good." Any law or institution is ultimately formulated by humans. If humans themselves lose the stance and commitment of high-dimensional life forms, who will then uphold and defend human laws and institutions?  

When Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was first established, it uncovered nearly twenty corrupt groups within the Hong Kong Police Force alone, including the four "superintendent tycoons"—major corrupt figures. No human institutional system can avoid favoritism and lawlessness on its own; in the end, it relies on human nature and instincts. These instincts drive the public to supervise, legislators to construct just laws, and law enforcers to execute justice.  

[Without these instincts and the underlying drive for justice, even the best laws and mechanisms will merely become weapons for grabbing parties to suppress, attack, and morally coerce one another.]()  

A truly good institution must act on instincts and genes, thereby generating a positive cycle:  

[Instincts give rise to institutions, which in turn shape instincts. Better instincts then lead to better institutions, which further shape better instincts, and so on. If an institution only yields immediate benefits without selecting and shaping human instincts toward virtue, it cannot be considered a good institution.]()

<p align="center">The positive cycle generated by truly good institutions</p>  

Just as we should not deny market economics and law because of their flaws, we should not abandon moral instincts because their influence is waning. Some believe that culture will replace the role of moral instincts. I do not deny that culture will increasingly impact humanity, and in the next millennium, we will inevitably rely more on culture and rationality:  

[But human instincts remain a deeper foundation for all these constructs. Preserving and propagating these instincts, and preserving individuals with these instincts, remain of utmost importance. With good people (where "good people" are defined as those who can generate and uphold good institutions), there will be good institutions; without good people, even the best institutions will deteriorate and distort.]()  

True moral instinct is essentially the instinct of high-dimensional life. The greatest contradiction facing human society today lies in the discrepancy between the degree of awakening of high-dimensional life instincts and the rapid expansion of human group size.

If we acknowledge the paramount importance of laws and institutions, then the significance of moral instinct is beyond doubt. What are legal systems? They regulate what humans can or cannot do. Human instinct and human nature, however, constitute a deeper - level institution—one that fundamentally determines what humans can or cannot do. It is the most critical and essential spontaneous institution.  

In fact, moral instinct is an institution above all human institutions, a constitution above all laws and constitutions. It is the root of all the beauty and order observable in human societies. With the primal force of this instinct, even without laws, we can reshape laws; even without markets, we can rebuild markets. Yet should this instinct be lost, humanity would be nothing.  

Therefore, in the long run, moral instinct remains the foundation, core, and prime mover of all behaviors in human civilization, as established by the Virtue Selection Mechanism. This very foundation is also the sole reason why humans, among all known forms of life, are distinct from other animals, AI, and machines—and why humans are destined to dominate over and control them, rather than the reverse. Moreover, this foundation will serve as our last stronghold in confronting the Dimensional Collapse Crisis, namely, the Evolutionary Crisis.
