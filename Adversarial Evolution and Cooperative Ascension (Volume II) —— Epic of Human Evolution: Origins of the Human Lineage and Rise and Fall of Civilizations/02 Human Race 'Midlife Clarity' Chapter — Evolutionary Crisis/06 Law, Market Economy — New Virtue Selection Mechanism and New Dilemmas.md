# Law and Market Economy—New Virtue Selection Mechanisms and New Dilemmas  
Facing the evolutionary crisis where the "Virtue Selection Mechanism" fails to keep pace with changes in the social environment, humanity, endowed with high intelligence and subjective agency, has not remained passive. They have made numerous attempts and innovations, some of which are effective methods that have, to a certain extent, salvaged the Virtue Selection Mechanism. Among these, [law, market economy, and corporate mechanisms are all monumental great innovations.]() They were invented (evolved) at appropriate historical junctures. [They have, to some extent, alleviated—but perhaps more accurately, delayed—the Adversarial Evolution crisis faced by human society amid drastic changes.]() Why do I refer to the emergence of these concepts as "evolution"? In fact, this process is akin to genetic evolution. When these mechanisms first appeared, it was a matter of chance, and many other mechanisms were also tested during the same period. However, groups with superior mechanisms would gain a higher fitness advantage—their productivity would be stronger. Thus, driven by "group competition and natural selection," these mechanisms that enhance group fitness were preserved and propagated. Of course, this process also differs from genetic evolution; their emergence follows discernible patterns, and some can be deduced through logical reasoning. [Moreover, the dissemination of these mechanisms does not occur through biological inheritance but through cultural transmission. Yet, for simplicity, this can also be referred to as the "evolution" of culture.]()  

## The Role of Law and Its Evolutionary Necessity  

### Population Explosion, Prevalence of Hypocrisy, and the Failure of Morality  
We have previously discussed why, as the scale of human communities expands rapidly, the moral mechanism supported by the traditional instinct of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" has increasingly failed to achieve the purpose of "Virtue Selection." People have been aware of this issue. Laozi was a forerunner in this regard, but his advocacy of "Non-Action Governance"—that is, maintaining the status quo—was impractical. Evolutionary trends are to some extent inevitable; even if Laozi’s own state could remain unchanged, he could not stop the evolutionary direction of other people or states. Another group of individuals who recognized that the broader evolutionary environment had changed and that past experiences were no longer applicable were the Legalists. Han Fei addressed this in the opening of *Five Vermin*: "Therefore, the sage does not expect to follow ancient ways, nor does he adhere to fixed rules. He examines the affairs of the age and prepares accordingly. There was a farmer in Song who, upon seeing a rabbit dash into a tree stump, break its neck, and die, laid down his plow and kept watch by the stump, hoping to catch another rabbit. He never caught another rabbit and became a laughingstock in Song. To govern the people of the present age using the policies of past kings is akin to waiting by the stump for another rabbit." This passage reflects Han Fei’s view that sages should not mimic the successful experiences of antiquity—specifically, the experience of moral instruction and benevolent governance. He created the parable of "waiting by the stump" to criticize those who dogmatically copied the governance concepts of ancient sage-kings without recognizing the changing circumstances. Han Fei was remarkably forward-thinking in his clear awareness of changes in the Adversarial Evolution environment.  

Next, Han Fei also identified the causes of these changes in the Adversarial Evolution environment: "In ancient times, with a small population and abundant resources, people did not quarrel. Hence, generous rewards and severe punishments were unnecessary, and the people governed themselves. Today, having five sons is not considered many, and each son may have five sons of his own. By the time the grandfather is still alive, he may have twenty-five grandchildren. With a large population and scarce resources, people toil hard but receive meager support, leading to quarrels. Even with doubled rewards and repeated punishments, chaos remains unavoidable." Han Fei incisively pointed out that population growth and insufficient survival resources lead to "people quarreling" and mutual grabbing, which are significant causes of state disorder. Of course, this is only a superficial cause; Han Fei still failed to recognize the covert grabbing degeneration that occurs when a group loses the pressure of group selection.  

In *Five Vermin*, Han Fei concluded by stating: "Thus, in a disordered state, the scholars extol the ways of past kings, using benevolence and righteousness as a pretext, dressing ostentatiously, and refining their arguments to cast doubt on contemporary laws and confuse the ruler’s mind. Those who speak of ancient times fabricate false claims, relying on external forces to further their private interests while neglecting the state’s welfare. The sword-wielding knights gather followers, uphold false integrity, and seek fame by violating official prohibitions. The war-avoiders cluster around powerful ministers, offering bribes to secure their intercession and evade military service. The merchant-artisans produce shoddy goods, amass frivolous wealth, and hoard resources to exploit farmers’ profits. These five types are the vermin of the state."  

Han Fei regarded these five types as typical hypocrites. They concealed their true intentions, disguised themselves, and engaged in deceptive acts of self-promotion. On the surface, they did not overtly violate moral judgments; some even posed as moral exemplars. In reality, however, their actions were covert and severe acts of grabbing. The covert nature of grabbing drastically reduced the efficiency of moral judgment, a critical Virtue Selection tool for human society. [The uniqueness of the Zhou-Qin Transformation lies precisely in the fact that the scale of human cooperation expanded to a critical threshold.]() According to some statistics, the population of the early Zhou Dynasty was only 5–6 million. After several centuries of growth, it reached 20–30 million at its peak, a five- to sixfold increase. [Thus, the human "Virtue Selection Mechanism" must undergo innovation to transition into a new era.]()  

*Five Vermin*, one of Han Fei’s representative works, is logically coherent and dialectical in language, making it well worth reading. However, I must also critique the underlying assumption of inherent human evil permeating *Five Vermin*: "Hence, people readily renounced the title of Son of Heaven in ancient times but are reluctant to relinquish the post of district magistrate today, due to differences in the benefits involved"; "Ancients devalued wealth not out of benevolence but because wealth was abundant; today’s quarrels over wealth are not out of meanness but because wealth is scarce." Han Fei’s message here is that ancient kings were willing to abdicate because the benefits of the throne were minimal, whereas modern magistrates cling to their posts because the benefits are greater; ancients devalued wealth not due to kindness but because they had plenty, while today’s disputes over wealth stem not from meanness but from scarcity. [The Legalists observed the evil side of human nature but failed to recognize the evolutionary process of moral degeneration from virtue to evil through grabbing. Instead of exploring the root causes, they固化ly assumed that human nature is inherently evil. This view deviates further from the essence of things than固化ly assuming inherent goodness and leads to more severe side effects.]() Nevertheless, the Legalists pragmatically identified the internal issues in human social evolution and soberly recognized the role that law would play in this process.  

### The Professionalized Immune System—The Judicial System  
[During the Zhou-Qin Transformation, the significance of law lies in the fact that law and professional legal workers align with the general trend of specialized division of labor in cooperation. Just as in three-dimensional life, "Virtue Selection" is carried out by specialized immune cells, for human society—a four-dimensional life form—the professionalization of the immune system is only a matter of time. A professional, specialized, and enforcement-oriented judicial system is necessary to more accurately and effectively identify and eliminate grabbing behaviors, which is of critical importance amid the proliferation of hypocrisy.]()  

[On the other hand, due to the influence of grabbing tendencies, the proportion of grabbing individuals increased after centuries of stable reproduction during the Zhou Dynasty. This explains why the Legalists’ assumption of inherent human evil often held true in the late stages of dynasties, whereas Confucian thinking was more applicable to the early stages of dynasties, characterized by wise rulers and virtuous ministers. When the proportion of grabbing individuals is high, strict enforcement of the law becomes even more necessary—severe penalties are appropriate in turbulent times.]()  

As mentioned in previous chapters, law is essentially a form of the Virtue Selection Mechanism. [Law provides the power of public authority to punish evil,]() ensuring that those who commit crimes receive punishment commensurate with their offenses, thereby reducing their broad fitness. This model is indeed an effective supplementary measure amid the decline of the individual Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection mechanism. I emphasize again that [grabbing tendencies and Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms are perspectives often overlooked in studies of life sciences and social sciences.]() We frequently focus on a life form’s speed, physical strength, or intelligence; we also often examine a nation’s economic and technological strength. However, [these "surface phenomena" are capabilities emerging from the internal complex systems of high-dimensional life forms,]() including speed, strength, intelligence, economy, and technology. These are all "cooperative capabilities" of life forms at different dimensions, and the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism is the backbone (spinal column) supporting these capabilities and the true challenge. We can recall that in the history of life, every effective "innovation" in the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism has brought about revolutionary changes to the living world, and law and market economy are no exception.

### The Essence and Legitimacy of Criminal Law: Retributive Theory or Preventive Theory?  
With the theoretical foundation of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension established, we can revisit some past concepts. For example, the essence and legitimacy of criminal law.

This is an ancient legal issue that has long been at the center of debate. As early as over 1,700 years ago, Plato mentioned in *Laws* two directions for justifying punishment: retrospective retribution and prospective prevention. The retrospective perspective focuses on past crimes, positing that "punishment is imposed because a crime has been committed," from which the Retributive Theory of Punishment developed. The prospective perspective, conversely, concerns future crimes, holding that "punishment is imposed to prevent crimes," giving rise to various Preventive Theories of Punishment. Discussions on the justification of punishment have largely revolved around these two theories.  

The Retributive Theory of Punishment asserts that by making the offender endure suffering, their actions are met with retribution, compensation, and atonement. Originating from the simple sense of justice rooted in human beings' instinct for retributive vengeance—exemplified by "an eye for an eye"—its rational justification comes from Enlightenment thinkers like Kant and Hegel. For Kant, punishment itself independently and fully justifies its own meaning; there is no need to seek additional social utility to legitimate it. He even argued that the last murderer on a desolate island about to disband must still be executed. In Hegel’s dialectics, punishment sublates crime: criminal acts negate the law, and punishment negates that negation. The ideas of Kant and Hegel have infused punishment with profound ethical overtones.  

In contrast to the Retributive Theory’s opposition to using punishment for other ends, the Preventive Theory of Punishment grounds its legitimacy in social outcomes—specifically, crime prevention or reducing crime rates. It holds that punishment must serve concrete social purposes, i.e., "preventing crime." In short, the Preventive Theory aims to "deter others" through criminal law to prevent future offenses. Though the idea of preventive punishment has ancient roots—Beccaria, for instance, proposed a prevention-oriented criminal law reform based on social contract theory in *On Crimes and Punishments*—the most significant contributions to its theoretical advancement in criminal law came from German scholars Feuerbach and Liszt. Feuerbach advocated general prevention, while Liszt pioneered specific prevention. Historically, Feuerbach laid the theoretical foundation for the principle of legality through his general prevention theory, earning him the title of "father of modern criminal law."  

Against the theoretical framework of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension, how should we understand the legitimacy of criminal law? First, the Retributive Theory, stemming from primitive justice sentiments, naturally aligns with the sense of justice and morality that emerged during humanity’s Cooperative Ascension. However, these intuitive judgments are time-bound; as society evolves and the environment of Adversarial Evolution changes, they may become outdated or biased, potentially hindering Cooperative Ascension. Thus, pure retribution based on primitive justice sentiments is unwise.  

On the other hand, the Preventive Theory, in essence, reflects the role that legal systems—acting as Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms—should play in the process of Cooperative Ascension. Yet, it is overly short-sighted, focusing only on immediate deterrence while neglecting punishment’s long-term impact on cooperative communities. If "pathological" individuals who engage in grabbing behaviors evade punishment, their success in acquiring more resources and genetic advantages will rapidly "infiltrate the body" like a tumor. [Hence, the latent and most critical function of criminal law is to reduce the fitness of grabbing individuals, preventing the "rapid spread of tumors"—in other words, fulfilling the role of Virtue Selection.]( ) This is precisely the latent effect of the Retributive Theory’s ethical judgments. Additionally, the Preventive Theory, akin to "encouraging virtue," has counterproductive effects: it suppresses instincts, creating discrepancies between phenotypes and genotypes, which harms the identification of "cancer cells." This also explains the significance of abolishing severe punishment and redefining criminal law as non-punitive in purpose.  

Therefore, [criminal law is essentially a "Virtue Selection" mechanism that prevents the emergence of severe grabbing individuals in high-dimensional life forms. It weakens and reduces the genetic advantages of such individuals, halting the spread of factors that could dismantle high-dimensional life systems. It is part of the immune system of high-dimensional life and a critical Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism for human society. Catering to human sentiments of justice or deterring others are merely superficial or secondary functions.]( )  

### The Necessity of Reconstructing Legal Principles Through Adversarial Evolution Theory  

We know that debates over the legitimacy of law and the relationship between law and morality have persisted for millennia, with no consensus. At the core lies the question: what underpins value judgments and distinctions between Virtue and Evil? Joshua Greene in *Moral Tribes*, Richard Bernstein in *Radical Evil*, and Alasdair MacIntyre in *After Virtue* all note that ethical discussions lack a compelling theory to define values and evil, with some even deeming it impossible. Hume’s "is-ought problem"—the difficulty of deriving "ought" (value judgments) from "is" (factual descriptions)—further reflects the challenge of justifying values. G.E. Moore’s "naturalistic fallacy" argument in *Principia Ethica* also highlights issues with defining good (value) through natural properties, indirectly illustrating the complexity of value justification.  

Hart writes in *Law, Liberty and Morality*:  
> "[Values and evil are unprovable.] Are oppression, cruelty, and superstition evil (negations of value)? Are enlightenment and freedom good? These are matters that cannot be proven. We cannot even prove that life or survival is good, despite the overwhelming number of people who have a desire to live and the enormous costs incurred for this purpose. However, we must note that if we do not assume the deep-rooted human tendency to consider life and the improvement of life quality as valuable, the entire system of everyday concepts such as danger and safety, harm and benefit, needs and functions, disease and cure would become meaningless." (Excerpted from *The Concept of Law*)  

Philosophical literature abounds with discussions on the nature, foundation, and cognition of values. Are values objective features of our world or of human nature? Do we grasp them through special cognition or perception? Or through "moral sense"? Are they projections of our emotional structures, rooted in Hume’s "calm passions"? Do objectively correct moral truths exist, and how do we discover them? Traditional theories and philosophies fail to adequately answer these "ultimate" questions, often lapsing into empiricism or moral sentimentalism. While such vague attributions may suffice for "Virtue Selection" in most cases, they occasionally lead to moral populism—relying on outdated instincts—or overly dogmatic, utilitarian errors.  

In the past, human reason has not transcended the value-judging capacity of genetic instincts. We often cannot coherently explain the value logic behind every moral judgment. [However, as elaborated in earlier chapters, I believe readers have glimpsed that Adversarial Evolution, as a theoretical framework for interpreting the primary cause of life values—though still in its infancy—exhibits powerful explanatory force in moral and legal judgments and holds potential to unify diverse theories.]( )  

## Legal Deficiencies: Law Has Yet to Fully Replace Morality  

As a Virtue Selection mechanism, a Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism for human society, and a product of the professionalization of the "immune system" during Dimension Ascension, the importance and necessity of legal and judicial systems are self-evident. Yet, realistically, has the current judicial system grown strong enough to entirely replace morality, rendering individual moral judgments unnecessary?  

### Laggardness and Omissions: Punishing Evil Falls Short of Eradicating It  

In human evolution, punishing evil was long a private (small-group) act, a heroic deed of chivalrous individuals. When this responsibility is fully delegated to public power—with private acts of punishing evil even prohibited by mainstream social norms—the immediacy and nuance of such punishment are greatly diminished. In the past, "the net of justice was vast, with wide meshes but no escape"; people, driven by their revulsion for evil, would weaken evildoers’ fitness from all angles. Today, with this duty shifted to public power, non-legal professionals seem to stand by, reaping the benefits. The side effects, however, are profound.  

[Certain domains beyond legal coverage, gray areas of the law, and upstream links in long chains of evil may remain unpunished for extended periods.]( ) [Additionally, as Maine’s adage goes, "Any law becomes outdated the moment it is enacted," and the law suffers from severe laggardness. Combined with the principle of legality, many emerging fields or ambiguously defined severe grabbing behaviors are difficult to criminalize. While common law countries address this through judicial precedents and expanded judicial discretion, this also creates room for corruption, as seen in cases like "Mark Fuller v. United States" and "Giulio Andreotti’s trials" in Italy.]( ) [These grabbing behaviors evade "Virtue Selection" and escape fitness penalties. Consequently, grabbing genes will inevitably outcompete cooperative genes—undermining the foundation of human society.]( )

In cases such as Liu Anyun's, we witness how the legitimate rights and interests of honest individuals are often difficult to protect under the law, while the costs and consequences of deception for deceivers remain excessively low. Liu Anyun, lured by Chen Aiqin's smooth-tongued manipulation, invested emotion, enormous effort, and savings into their relationship. Yet when betrayed, he was left helpless and powerless. Repeatedly deceived in both affection and finances, then scorned and mocked, he finally snapped after overhearing Chen plotting with her lover to swindle him further. He killed the four members of her family, and ultimately faced the death penalty himself. Though sentenced to death, many still sympathize with his actions and fate. From an evolutionary perspective, while Liu's response was extreme, it inadvertently prevented the propagation of "malignant genes."  

Despite the increasing complexity and profusion of modern legal provisions, the law remains woefully inadequate in rewarding virtue and punishing vice. For those with sufficient shamelessness, mere obstinate persistence can yield substantial gains. Take Free-Riderists, for instance: they latch onto high-cooperation individuals who diligently generate cooperative dividends, parasitically siphoning benefits. When others make self-sacrifices for collective good, these Free-Riderists gladly accept the benefits; when called to contribute to the collective, they shrink back. While others shed blood and sweat for the group, they live in comfort, taking others’ efforts for granted. When the group faces crises, they only consider their own interests, indifferent to whether the collective collapses—they ensure they always profit from the cooperation. Confronted with moral condemnation or irrefutable facts, they deny everything unflinchingly, for moral reproach carries negligible weight in modern society. Tuning out others’ appeals, they remain steadfastly self-serving, safeguarding every personal interest, and brazenly seizing others’ benefits. Such individuals thus secure dominance in the realm of Grabbingism. Even if the cooperative relationship dissolves, they suffer no loss—having been bloodsuckers rather than contributors, they simply seek new hosts. [This pattern frequently occurs in coercive cooperative relationships: between spouses, siblings, classmates, or contracted companies, becoming a quintessential Grabbingist paradigm.]  

### The Tragedy of Prematurely Blocking Individual Virtue Selection  
More lamentable is the plight of those who retain the "hatred of evil" gene and strong moral conviction—such as the protagonists in *The Silence of the Truth* (the novel *The Long Night Is Hard to Dawn*) and the Korean drama *Signal*, as mentioned in the previous volume. Their evolutionary fitness suffers dual blows: on one hand, they expend their lives and energies to uncover truths, punish wrongs, and console the virtuous; on the other, they may inadvertently violate laws, risking legal punishment themselves. Such virtue-upholding acts prove unsustainable, as the law lacks mechanisms to support them. These "immune cells" of human society—genes that once safeguarded collective cooperation—face multifaceted suppression, posing grave risks, especially at a stage where specialized "immune systems" (judicial institutions) remain imperfect. [Professionalization and self-organization are both critical features of high-dimensional life systems. We should reflect more on how to leverage and enhance the foundational mechanisms humanity has developed over millennia.]  

### Legal Overfitting, Secondary Crimes, and the Dual Dilemma  
Like all boundaries of justice, legal boundaries tend to "age." Fundamentally, Grabbingism thrives at legal margins, gaps, and gray zones. By weeding out reckless Grabbingists who flagrantly cross legal lines, the law inadvertently empowers more cunning ones—those adept at "skirting edges," exploiting loopholes, or manipulating legal ambiguities. As legal boundaries remain static over long periods, these "Grabbing genes" gain time to mutate and adapt, ultimately fitting legal provisions to the extreme while maximizing their exploitative behavior. Combined with legal principles like "legality of punishment" and "presumption of innocence," the rewards of treading legal edges become disproportionately high. Within generations, these "overfitted" Grabbing genes, having outcompeted law-abiding and morally upright individuals, spread widely.  

In neural network training, one solution to overfitting is introducing random noise to perturb inputs, gradients, or outputs. This inspires a legal parallel: though initially appearing vague, introducing variability in legal interpretation and enforcement—such that fitting legal boundaries becomes unpredictable—could deter would-be exploiters. "Random inspections" during legal execution might also reduce costs. Of course, legal innovation and adaptability remain paramount.  

Legal overfitting directly spawns Secondary Crimes, exemplified by the "Lantern Damage Claim" case in Shangrao, Jiangxi, and the "Exorbitant Repair Cost" case in Xinyu, Jiangxi. Both involve extortionists brazenly violating common sense and morality—even with police present. In the first, a tenant demanding over 10,000 yuan in repairs for a 1,200-yuan/month rental; in the second, a 1,000-yuan repair quote escalating to 17,000, with threats to damage the vehicle if unpaid. [I term such behavior—technically legal but gravely immoral and unreasonable—"Secondary Crimes."] Perpetrators, aware the law cannot punish them, flout morality with impunity, embodying the "I-am-a-hooligan, whom-should-I-fear" mentality. This is a critical flaw in pure legalism.  

Such flaws remain manageable when societal moral standards (the "humanity mean") are high. Yet as reverse selection worsens, moral standards decline, and legal boundaries are increasingly tested, Secondary Crimes will explode. Some may attribute this to China’s legal immaturity, but it stems more from the declining humanity mean. Even in the U.S.—a legal benchmark—such phenomena have risen with falling moral standards. For example, a U.S. law protects tenants who occupy a property for 30+ days: landlords cannot evict them or cut utilities without lengthy legal proceedings (often over a year). Homeless groups have overfitted this law: they occupy vacant homes, claim 30-day residency upon discovery, and when landlords change locks, *they* call the police to have the landlord arrested. Such cases are rare in the West due to younger, less morally degraded populations, but they underscore that legal systems cannot solve all ills.  

This example also reveals another legal flaw: [Dual Dilemma]. The 30-day protection, intended to safeguard tenants, creates a trap for landlords, whose legitimate interests go unprotected. It becomes a choice between empowering malicious landlords or malicious tenants—no-win. Like the tension between coercive interrogation and crime-solving rates, [humanity’s legal system grapples with overfitting and Dual Dilemmas, where any adjustment risks unforeseen loopholes, stalling legal progress. This, in turn, fuels the proliferation of Secondary Crimes, increasingly unmanageable.]  

### Prioritizing Operability and Cost Over Precision, Lacking Foundational Theoretical Support  
If moral judgment is a fine-scale balance, law is a set of coarse weights. Legal provisions often compromise precision for operability and cost, resorting to "one-size-fits-all" solutions. In ambiguous domains—like "domestic disputes, where even a wise judge struggles"—law’s role is severely limited.  

Moreover, law lacks a rigorous, quantifiable theoretical framework. Legal principles often extend morality or rely on empiricism, rendering moral distinctions vague and unquantifiable. This mismatch between fitness and the gravity of vice leads to misalignment in consequences and erroneous incentives—people assume "if it’s not illegal, it’s permissible," treating uncodified moral wrongs as acceptable. [From the perspective of high-dimensional life’s Virtue Selection Mechanism, humanity’s current legal system has yet to fully replace moral judgment. However, this moral judgment requires radical upgrades: it must be highly rational, quantifiable, and guided by theories of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension.]

From the perspective of the foreseeable future, legal mechanisms still require substantial transformation and evolution. We may draw parallels to the complexity of the immune system of three-dimensional life forms, which sets up multiple checkpoints and operates in a step-by-step manner, forming an extremely intricate system. A mature immune system of a four-dimensional life form, therefore, cannot be simplistic either. For instance, it must fully integrate big data and AI capabilities, enable greater public participation at low cost, and further leverage self-organization—a critical characteristic of high-dimensional life systems.  

Over a prolonged foreseeable historical period, law and morality should complement each other, compensate for each other’s deficiencies, and jointly support the most crucial and challenging Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism for humanity, the largest four-dimensional life form ever to exist.  

### Both Law and Morality Are Prone to Exploitation  
One significant reason some people disdain traditional morality is its ambiguous definitions, which easily become tools for moral coercion. In contrast, laws and regulations are more explicit and predictable, seemingly less prone to being weaponized for harm. While laws and regulations do mitigate the imprecision of morality to some extent, they are by no means immune to misuse. In reality, morality, regulations, and law can all be exploited for malevolent purposes. Although morality and law under the Adversarial Evolution framework have relatively clear definitions and deductive formulas, ultimately, only instinct and group competition can correct such distortions.  

## The Role of Market Economy—An Advanced Virtue Selection Mechanism  
From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, legal mechanisms are indeed one of humanity’s landmark inventions. Any mechanism capable of altering the course of Adversarial Evolution will exert a lasting and critical influence, shaping the underlying logic of historical development. This holds true for law, and it will also apply to the market economy model discussed next. If law addresses the issue of *punishing evil*, the market economy mechanism aims to resolve the issue of *rewarding virtue*. The ideal state of the market economy is to grant extraordinary returns to enterprises and individuals with strong creativity, high cooperation degrees, and significant social contributions, thereby enhancing their inclusive fitness. This constitutes the underlying logic behind the positive effects of the market economy.  

To discuss the market economy, we must mention Adam Smith and his magnum opus *The Wealth of Nations*, often hailed as the "Bible of the market economy." Through this work, the public has gained a preliminary understanding of the market economy. Undoubtedly, the market economy ranks among humanity’s greatest inventions and discoveries. However, debates persist regarding the "liberalism" and "Individualism" it entails, with Marx highlighting the exploitation of workers through "surplus value" by capitalists. Amidst these complex and even contradictory social practices and theoretical perspectives, I aim to use the Adversarial Evolution framework to depict a more truthful portrait of the market economy, its genuine significance, and potential issues. Below, we re-examine the market economy through the lens of Adversarial Evolution.  

### Unleashing Cooperative Dividends—Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off  
The most prominent and evident function of the market economy is to facilitate broader and deeper exchanges of material and energy. This act of complementing needs, leveraging comparative advantages, and optimizing resource allocation is a quintessential cooperative behavior, which undoubtedly generates enormous Cooperative Dividends. The fundamental reason for the market economy’s widespread success lies in its promotion of large-scale cooperation and its partial resolution of Cooperative Dividend distribution. Groups and market-economy cultures that harbor such high Cooperative Dividends are "selected" and propagated.  

As discussed in Volume I, issues of Adversarial Evolution are fundamentally economic in nature. The overarching trend of Adversarial Evolution is toward enhancing Cooperative Dividends. Cooperative Dividends are synonymous with concepts like productivity, economic strength, and national power. Regardless of terminology, mechanisms that enhance cooperation and generate Cooperative Dividends align with the evolutionary trend and are inevitable outcomes of evolution. Finance, at its core, aims to increase Cooperative Dividends by optimizing resource allocation to achieve the most efficient Cooperative Dividends. It functions like gears between individuals, linking human labor—a point thoroughly analyzed in *The Wealth of Nations*. Over the centuries of market economy development, various financial instruments have emerged, including currency, interest rates, debt, stock markets, futures, other financial derivatives, and hedging mechanisms. These are essentially lubricants for these gears, enabling smoother cooperation.  

### Quantification of Virtue and Evil—Rewarding Virtue and Punishing Evil  
What accounts for the market economy’s remarkable progress in human society over just a few centuries, generating unprecedented material wealth? The greatest strength of the market economy lies in its ability to achieve the *Quantification of Virtue and Evil* amid complex social activities, thereby enabling more precise moral assessment. This partially resolves the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism challenges of ultra-large cooperative groups, unleashing massive Cooperative Dividends.  

The market economy is a process of large-scale social exchange, where grabbing and altruistic behaviors coexist. For example, selling goods at a lower price reflects altruistic tendencies, while overpricing indicates grabbing tendencies. How to measure these tendencies? *Fair Bidding* serves as an effective method: prices above market rates lean toward grabbing, while below-market prices lean toward altruism. Among equivalent goods, the lowest market price reflects the strongest altruism. The market economy tightly links "altruism" with "Price Measurement," using precise monetary values to quantify altruism—a groundbreaking innovation in the Virtue Selection Mechanism.  

Thus, the market economy is an effective tool for the precise *Quantification of Virtue and Evil* and *rewarding virtue and punishing evil* in complex social activities. Its resounding success stems from upholding the principle that "virtue is rewarded and evil is punished"—measuring human cooperation levels through quantification and "rewarding virtue" via outcome-oriented economic returns. This effectively implements the Virtue Selection Mechanism. Enterprises with stronger altruism receive better returns, enabling them to engage in more altruistic acts, thus entering a virtuous cycle. If all economic participants engage in mutually altruistic behaviors guided by market rules, society will attain unprecedented Cooperative Dividends, as even Marx acknowledged: "The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together."  

The fundamental success of the market economy does not lie in superficial factors like freedom, Individualism, or private property. Its core strength, shared with religion and law, is achieving large-scale Cooperative Dividends through more precise virtue rewarding and evil punishing. The day the market economy deviates from this attribute will mark its decline. Additionally, the market economy’s success teaches us the need to transition from naive, intuitive views of Virtue and Evil to quantitative, economic ones. Subjective altruism is virtuous, and objective altruism is also virtuous—though unmotivated virtue should be discounted, as the former is more valuable in the long run. Only by understanding this can we lay the ideological foundation required for humanity’s next historical phase.  

### The Market Economy as a Cure for Hypocrisyism  
As previously noted, since the Holocene epoch, human society has undergone profound transformations amid rapid population growth. Among these changes, the prevalence of Hypocrisyism has posed an unprecedented crisis. In addressing the global challenge of rampant Hypocrisyism and eroding morality, the market economy plays a "transformative" role. Money, as an objective and quantifiable metric, combined with the market’s price competition mechanism, ensures relatively fair pricing. This enables value comparisons across unrelated goods, services, and behaviors.  

With this foundation, mutually beneficial cooperative behaviors (virtuous acts) can be further quantified. For instance, a doctor and a farmer, engaged in distinct social divisions of labor, produce different "products" and invest different labor. Without market prices as a guide, determining how much agricultural produce the farmer should provide in exchange for medical treatment would rely on subjective judgment. Such subjectivity, distorted by grabbing tendencies, would inevitably favor self-interest, potentially leading to exploitation or the collapse of cooperation. Under the market economy framework, however, this transaction becomes more objective and equitable: the market price for medical treatment dictates the equivalent monetary value the farmer should earn through poultry farming or crop cultivation to reciprocate.

With the establishment of the market bidding system, productive activities in human society can be more easily transformed into "altruistic" behaviors. In theory, as long as goods are sold at the lowest market price, the production behavior of suppliers becomes an altruistic rather than grabbing act. This is because, among transaction partners chosen by rational free individuals, prices are relatively lower than the market average—or even the lowest.  

The market economy has effectively and quantifiably resolved the issue of Virtue and Evil judgment in complex human social activities. Owing to its objective and quantifiable nature, the market economy initially also served to dispel Hypocrisyism. Under the guidance of market rules, goods and suppliers that are flashy, ostentatious, or fraudulent, as well as social behaviors that seek profit through deception and false pretenses, are theoretically eliminated by market forces.  

For humanity—a four-dimensional life form—the most significant and glorious role of the market economy lies in its partial resolution of the challenge of Virtue and Evil judgment in large-scale cooperation. It has delayed and mitigated life crises such as hypocrisy, Individual Cancerization, and internal corruption, while reactivating humanity’s cooperative potential and boundless vitality. Through the "invisible hand" of market rules, it guides labor division and Non-grabbing Competition. It prevents grabbing behaviors via legal instruments such as antitrust laws, anti-dumping laws, and intellectual property protection laws. It rewards high-cooperation virtuous groups through corporate profits, listings, and equity returns. It punishes grabbing acts via legal means. Confronted with the declining moral standards of humanity, the market economy leverages laws and market rules to avoid losses from grabbing, and incentivizes highly cooperative companies and groups with substantial commercial rewards. In this sense, the market economy achieves the "Virtue Selection" goal of rewarding Virtue and punishing Evil. It accomplishes this through relatively objective and quantifiable market principles—a method that compresses the operational space of hypocrites and evaluates Virtue and Evil more objectively than traditional moral judgment mechanisms. Hence, since the market economy’s flourishing, global cooperation levels and productivity have reached unprecedented heights.  

When I analyzed this from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution and concluded that "the market economy is currently the most effective tool known to resist the trend of Hypocrisyism in human society," I—a person raised under Marxist and communist education—felt a tinge of surprise. I suspect even the original inventors and proponents of the market economy would be astonished by its essential role and epoch-making significance in Adversarial Evolution. When Friedrich Hayek proclaimed, "Money is one of humanity’s greatest inventions," he likely also glimpsed the profound significance of money and the market economy built upon it in the process of Adversarial Evolution.  

### Market Behavior Replacing Failed Emotional Bonds  
Another manifestation of the market economy’s ability to overcome Hypocrisyism is its relatively objective measurement of mutual benefits between transactional parties. In the past, cooperative behaviors rooted in mutual aid—"I help you when you need it, and you help me when I need it"—relied on gratitude, a critical emotional bond sustaining human cooperation. However, with the rise of Hypocrisyism, gratitude is the first casualty. People focus on others’ flaws while ignoring their own, then rationalize through self-deception that others owe them rather than the reverse in long-term cooperation. Consequently, spontaneous and conscious reciprocal gratitude via emotional bonds is severely eroded by hypocrisy. Eventually, cooperative parties end their relationship in mutual blame and resentment.  

Market behavior and pricing, though often inaccurate, unreasonable, and prone to manipulation, offer the most quantifiable and efficient evaluation method currently known. This approach better resists the influence of manipulative tactics like emotional blackmail (e.g., "playing the victim" or "righteous anger") on cooperative benefit distribution. A deep understanding of the prevalence of hypocrisy and PUA in human society reveals the secret behind the market economy’s success.  

### "The Evil of Cooperation"—How "Individualism" Can Be a More Advanced Collectivism  
Under the market economy, there exists a tendency toward Individualism. Before discussing its issues, we must clarify its significance. Superficially, harmonious cooperation seems ideal—"everyone gets along." Yet, "the Evil of Cooperation" quietly unfolds. Within cooperative systems, grabbing genes can proliferate by exploiting implicit "egalitarian" resource distribution. Specifically, grabbing individuals may shirk effort, avoid risks, and focus solely on self-benefit, yet demand "equal distribution" by claiming they "tried their best." They use collectivist morality to coerce others, achieving de facto grabbing under the guise of fairness.  

At first glance, magnanimity from hardworking individuals might seem beneficial to the collective. However, this severely damages long-term collective interests. Capable, diligent, and selfless contributors suffer losses, while lazy, risk-averse, and self-serving individuals thrive by siphoning equal shares. Over time, the proportion of hardworking individuals declines, lazy ones surge, and collective productivity plummets. The Chinese adage "people resent inequality more than poverty" reflects this aversion to unfair distribution in cooperation. Often, reluctance to cooperate stems not from opposition to collaboration itself, but from grossly unjust post-cooperation benefit allocation. Blind pursuit of equality or needs-based distribution inherently contains profound inequity. In this sense, "the Evil of Cooperation" is more pernicious than non-cooperation. Great ideals like Utopianism, Communism, and Socialism have all faltered due to this "Evil of Cooperation."  

The market economy has partially resolved this issue by monetizing all values, enabling relatively precise individual-based benefit evaluation and distribution. Medieval Western societies, long constrained by religious collectivism, required an ideological tool to break free. Individualism was revived to challenge the old collectivist value system. The Individualist movement under the market economy thus represented a necessary, albeit overcorrected, process of dismantling centuries of Christian collectivist dogma.  

In essence, precise individual value measurement and benefit allocation—ensuring capable, dedicated, and selfless contributors receive rewards commensurate with their efforts—enables their genes to propagate more widely, ultimately benefiting the collective’s long-term interests. Therefore, what truly drives the market economy’s success is this seemingly Individualist yet profoundly farsighted Collectivism.  

### Self-Organization, Self-Drive, and Transforming Self-Interest into Altruism  
The market economy’s genius lies in aligning individual interests with collective interests—a result-oriented approach that fosters self-organization. Ant societies exemplify this self-organizing model, which coexists with their collectivist structure. Similarly, most human bodily functions are self-organized rather than centrally controlled by the brain. A common misconception about high-dimensional life forms is that they are highly centralized, with all decisions made by a "brain." In reality, most life activities in humans and animals occur without central brain processing, as organs and systems self-organize. Many "silent organs" in our bodies repair damage autonomously, often undetectable without medical checks.  

From an evolutionary perspective, self-organization is a sophisticated and critical mechanism for constructing macroscopic high-dimensional life. The market economy’s primary advantage lies in its self-organization and self-drive. Profit-seeking individuals, guided by the market’s invisible hand, keenly observe unmet market demands and human pain points, striving to address them first for excess profits. This self-driven, self-organizing responsiveness is far more efficient and cost-effective than top-down centralized management. It resembles the content production revolution in Web 2.0, where mass participation in creation and competition yields richer, more intricate, and innovative outcomes than elite-driven planning.  

It is worth clarifying that profit-seeking psychology—rooted in millions of years of human technological improvement and scientific progress—is the driving force behind the market economy’s self-organization. However, profit-seeking and grabbing are easily conflated; crossing the line from profit-seeking to grabbing transforms the nature of the behavior entirely. This is one reason the market economy often exhibits dualistic characteristics.

Regarding the self-organizing attributes of the market economy, Hayek, in *The Fatal Conceit*, also enumerated a series of related theoretical concepts, such as spontaneous generation theory, cybernetics, endogenous equilibrium, spontaneous order, and systems theory. As for how the self-driving nature of the market economy manifests itself, there exists a recommended mode of thinking and value orientation for individuals participating in the market economy. On this point, Li Mu (a leading figure in AI and Senior Chief Scientist at Amazon) summarized it aptly in his *Reflections After Five Years of Work*. The formula he proposed for evaluating the value of an action is: [Value (and reward) of an action = Number of beneficiaries × Average time per beneficiary × Value difference per unit time](). The first two indicators—number of beneficiaries and average time per beneficiary—require little explanation; their product represents the total social benefit. The third term, "value difference per unit time," depends on the quality of how you execute the task. Specifically, you must perform better than others in similar tasks, so that beneficiaries gain more from you than from others. Put simply, you should choose tasks that have broad social reach, high levels of benefit, and where your solution holds a significant advantage over existing ones. If you only provide equivalent value, even if the task has wide reach and deep impact, you are merely "reinventing the wheel" without creating genuine value. This value orientation encourages innovation. Ultimately, in the market economy system, such actions generally yield corresponding rewards—greater created value translates to greater returns. [This formula reveals the source of the market economy's robust self-organizing and self-driving capabilities.]() This is also the fundamental reason why a purely planned economy cannot surpass the market economy in superiority. The gap in information capacity is akin to the difference between Web1.0-era portals and Web2.0-era blogs and video platforms. [Under this value orientation and reward feedback mechanism, within the market economy, every rational economic actor serves as both a commander and practitioner in creating social value.]() The collective wisdom of countless individuals, filtered through natural selection, is certainly more nuanced and comprehensive than the wisdom of a small elite.  

Furthermore, the market economy owes its "effectiveness" to another key factor: [the market mechanism separates "outcomes" from "motives." Through the invisible hand of the market, it channels both "virtuous" (mutual aid, love) and "evil" (greed, grabbing) motives toward "virtuous" outcomes—even the most self-interested individuals, constrained by market mechanisms, are compelled to integrate into socialized mass production, maximizing their self-interest by producing cheaper goods (i.e., through "altruistic" means). Guided by market mechanisms, the cooperation degree of the entire human cooperative community increases, productivity rises, and economic efficiency and living standards achieve substantial progress.]() This represents a gradual path for three-dimensional life to ascend to the fourth dimension. We know that evolution rarely occurs through sudden leaps, yet every dimensional ascension of life signifies a transformative leap—abandoning three-dimensional self-interest and grabbing tendencies to achieve four-dimensional ascension through cooperation and altruism. Given its difficulty, such ascension often requires eons of gestation. The market economy, however, transforms grabbing into altruism, allowing humanity to preliminarily experience the splendor and potential of four-dimensional life through this magical mechanism.  

### Resolving the "Thousand-Li Horse Dilemma"—"Starved of Nourishment, Lacking Strength, and Talents Unmanifested"  
The market economy model addresses the problem of "rewarding virtue" better than any previous mechanism. Concepts like utopia, people’s communes, egalitarianism, and distribution according to need, while appealing—especially to those oppressed and exploited—are somewhat naive. Though long yearned for and practiced across history, they have rarely succeeded. As Hayek noted, "egalitarianism is the most destructive constructivist moral concept." While such ideologies stem from benevolent motives, they suffer from two critical flaws. First, they fail to prevent internal "cancerization": under egalitarianism or distribution according to need, regardless of effort, lazy, indolent individuals who "live off the common pot" without contributing would survive longer and reproduce more. Over time, this leads to *Reverse Selection*—a phenomenon where virtuous individuals are eliminated, and grabbing genes gain a genetic advantage, eroding social morality and cooperative capacity. Guarding against the proliferation of "cancer cells" is the most critical challenge for life forms at all dimensions, surpassing other concerns.  

Second, under equalized rewards, individuals with exceptional contributions or talents receive inadequate recognition. Take the "thousand-li horse" (a metaphor for exceptional individuals) described in Han Yu’s *On the Horse*: "A horse capable of traveling a thousand li may consume an entire picul of grain in one meal. If its keeper does not feed it according to its thousand-li capacity, this horse, despite its potential, will starve of adequate nourishment, lack the strength to perform, and its exceptional abilities will never fully manifest—even matching the performance of an ordinary horse becomes impossible, let alone traveling a thousand li." Exceptional individuals, such as scientists, inventors, and sociologists, immerse themselves in studying complex natural, mathematical, and social laws. They invest far less time in daily life, courtship, and family than the average person, yet their mental exertion, educational resources, and research costs exceed those of others. In an egalitarian society, their talents risk remaining "unmanifested," constrained by family trivialities and even struggling to marry or start a family. Under the market economy, however, if such individuals make outstanding contributions in their fields and translate these into economic value, they will secure substantial income. This financial stability helps them address family and relationship needs, enabling them to remain focused on their areas of expertise and continue contributing.  

Why do we need "thousand-li horses"? The adage "do not fear poverty, but fear inequality" suggests that universal mediocrity and contentment might suffice. However, such a community lacks competitive vitality and upward momentum, making it vulnerable to more dynamic communities or sudden natural/cosmic disasters. Over the long term, without sustained progress in natural and social sciences, humanity would remain in a state of privation. Our current standard of living and future resilience depend on the innovation of these "thousand-li horses."  

From the perspective of life’s billion-year evolution, cooperative division of labor and individual differentiation are prerequisites for dimensional ascension. Human society requires both "somatic cells"—numerous ordinary, hardworking individuals—and "brain cells"—strategic, visionary leaders. In all known high-dimensional life forms, resource distribution is not entirely equal. For example, in the human body, different cells receive varying nutrients; brain cells, which consume vast energy, receive significantly more oxygen and nourishment than other cells. Similarly, in four-dimensional life forms like ants and bees, queens monopolize most resources, far exceeding what average individuals receive. These are resource allocation patterns retained by high-dimensional life through natural selection, optimal for the overall well-being of the high-dimensional organism. They effectively practice "distribution according to need." [If "distribution according to need" is interpreted as allocation based on maximizing the long-term interests of the community, while avoiding allocation to "cancer cells," it is both feasible and commendable, representing the de facto allocation mode of high-dimensional life. To date, however, no allocation mechanism has fully achieved these goals. The market economy is nearly the closest known approximation to such a system.]()  

### Corporate Mechanism—Fostering Small-Group Competition  
The corporate mechanism represents another innovation built upon the market economy. By restructuring large human communities into relatively stable, cohesive small groups and subjecting them to market competition, [victors in group competition, to some extent, demonstrate that their groups have generated greater cooperative dividends, possess higher internal group cooperation degrees, and may even contain more "virtuous individuals."]() This small-group competition and survival-of-the-fittest mechanism further weakens and eliminates groups harboring grabbing or hypocritical individuals. Within the corporate framework, where success or failure affects all members, even the most adept hypocrites and grabbers struggle to thrive. [This outcome-oriented approach exposes grabbing and hypocrisy—poor corporate performance indirectly punishes such individuals. The corporate mechanism partially compensates for the loss of small-group competition following the decline of feudal systems, self-governing city-states, and "small states with small populations."]()  

[In summary, the market economy and corporate mechanisms have, to a degree, addressed issues arising from the failure of *Virtue Selection* mechanisms (reliant on innate virtue-upholding and evil-rejecting instincts) as human communities rapidly expanded in scale. Their cascading effects have enhanced socialized mass cooperation, unlocked enormous cooperative dividends, and propelled human communities into a new era of collaboration.]()  

### Surplus Value, Cooperative Dividends, and Cooperation Maintenance Costs  
Marx introduced the critical concept of "surplus value" in *Capital*—the labor value created by workers but expropriated by the bourgeoisie without compensation. Though somewhat outdated, this concept still aids in deepening our understanding of the corporate mechanism.

According to the description of "Surplus Value," nearly all enterprise profits are generated from surplus value, as if capitalists create no value whatsoever. Such a scenario may have indeed existed in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, due to competition among enterprises, capitalists themselves are also subject to survival of the fittest. What, then, is the primary value of capitalists? The value of capitalists lies in resource integration, personnel management, and, in general, work related to cooperation maintenance. As we have discussed multiple times earlier, the costs of cooperation maintenance are exorbitant, and the value created by capitalists is primarily reflected in fostering deeper and smoother cooperation mechanisms and environments.  

Of course, some capitalists participate almost entirely in neither production nor management, yet they share in enterprise profits merely by investing capital. However, this choice itself entails the effort of resource integration. Whether they make decisions impulsively or through careful research, probabilistically, their gains are proportional to their efforts. Additionally, since workers' wages are determined by market competition, we can approximate wages to the labor exerted by workers under the market-average level of cooperation. The better the cooperation mechanism and the larger the scale of cooperation, the greater the cooperative dividend created. Profits are primarily derived from cooperative dividends—more precisely, the differential between the cooperative dividend and the market-average cooperative dividend. Thus, roughly speaking:  

**Profit = Cooperative Dividend Differential (the value exceeding the market-average level of cooperation)**  

If this profit were entirely appropriated by capitalists, then:  

**Surplus Value = Profit - Cooperation Maintenance Cost = Cooperative Dividend Differential - Cooperation Maintenance Cost**  

Therefore, we can see that if all enterprise profits were to belong exclusively to capitalists, it would be unfair, as cooperative dividends are created by all employees. However, to claim that profits are entirely "exploited" by the bourgeoisie as surplus value extracted from workers is also unjust to capitalists. [For capitalists also create valuable cooperation maintenance mechanisms, which represent a form of latent but critical value](). Maintaining these mechanisms is often far more complex than outsiders might imagine. [If a society neglects the value of cooperation maintenance or fails to provide adequate recompense for it, its overall productivity will inevitably be relatively low. This is one of the fundamental reasons why capitalist societies, despite their many flaws, have been selected by group competition]().  

Modern equity mechanisms have thus far addressed this issue reasonably well, distributing surplus value according to shareholding.  

**Surplus Value = Profit - Cooperation Maintenance Cost = Cooperative Dividend Differential - Cooperation Maintenance Cost = Distributed According to Individual Shareholdings**  

However, because company managers and shareholders hold absolute decision-making power, equity distribution often lacks fairness. Furthermore, enterprises in monopolistic or illegal industries yield significantly higher profits due to the absence of competition, leading to severe overestimation of their cooperative dividends—another form of injustice. Therefore, while the market economy still has many flaws and is imperfect, we can no longer view it as we once did; it is continuously improving and evolving.  

Why does this seem like an attempt to defend capitalists? In truth, resource allocation is a critical topic for high-dimensional life forms. Drawing an analogy to the human body: as limb cells, they contribute tremendously to the body’s community—most bodily achievements are directly realized by limb cells. For example, this book I am writing is typed with my hands. Yet, it would be difficult to attribute all credit to my hands—would that not slight my brain and heart? However, the brain should not "exploit" limb cells excessively; it should treat them as part of itself, pursuing the overall interests of the cooperative community. When the brain faces mortal danger, limb cells will unhesitatingly protect it. What humanity most needs now is mutual understanding, empathy, and recognition among various social roles—fostering a spirit of brotherhood. Only then can we achieve the greatest and most long-term interests of our own classes and all classes.

### Deficiencies of the Market Economy  

In the foregoing discussion, I explained the role and significance of the market economy model in facilitating large-scale human social cooperation from the perspectives of "Quantification of Virtue and Evil" and "eliminating internal grabbing and hypocritical individuals through competition." The market economy has exerted enormous influence on human society and is even an indispensable component of today’s social structure. [We must acknowledge the advancement of the market economy system; I believe it is, to date, the most feasible, effective, and operationally viable "Virtue Selection Mechanism" for human society. Cooperation is not just a slogan—it requires robust mechanisms to support it, and the market economy has, to some extent, achieved the best in this regard]().  

However, this does not mean the market mechanism is perfect, nor can it solve all Virtue Selection issues once and for all. On the contrary, [the market economy, particularly its amplification and reliance on individualism, acts like a pseudo-high-dimensional state, masking many problems that may one day trigger severe backlash and annihilation—destruction potentially far exceeding the contributions the market economy has made and will make to human society](). This is why we must first understand the underlying principles by which the market economy functions, then analyze its flaws.  

#### "Selfishness Equals Altruism, Greed Equals Virtue"—The Over-Promotion of Individualism  

First, as previously discussed, the market economy’s mechanisms are highly effective. [It artfully transforms self-interested motives into altruistic and communal outcomes](). In the short term, this works remarkably well, enabling human society—stagnant due to population explosion, declining Virtue Selection, and moral degradation—to rapidly ascend to the "adult state" of four-dimensional life, unleashing unprecedented cooperative dividends. However, in the long term, it masks issues related to the evolutionary trends of individual instincts, planting seeds of profound risk.  

Some radical free-market advocates even encourage self-interest, urging people to pursue personal gain with all their might. They believe that within the market framework, self-interested drives will lead each economic actor to create greater social wealth. In other words, if everyone maximizes their personal interests, the "invisible hand" of the market will automatically increase overall social welfare. Economists are familiar with the foundational assumption that "[rational individuals are those who pursue the maximization of personal value]()." Based on this assumption, economics employs mathematical methods to analyze human economic behavior. Adam Smith, the father of economics, constructed his theories on this very premise. In *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), his seminal work, Smith first proposed that when individuals pursue personal value maximization, overall social welfare increases—a result of the market’s invisible hand.  

Continuing this tradition, in 1976, American economist Gary S. Becker published *Economic Analysis of Human Behavior*, which adhered to the "rational individual pursuing personal value maximization" assumption. Using mathematical tools, Becker analyzed everyday economic behaviors such as career choice, marriage, childbearing, and crime, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. This assumption thus became enshrined as a golden rule of the market economy. [*The Wealth of Nations* precisely outlined this effective method: using self-interested mindsets to achieve altruistic results, or even using grabbing mindsets to engage in cooperative actions]().  

Hence, people increasingly came to believe that maximizing personal interests is just, righteous, and even a feat beneficial to the nation and people. "Greed is good" became a mantra on Wall Street, while "fake it till you make it" was hailed as a golden rule for business success in Silicon Valley. Within the market framework, morality and integrity seemed reduced to mere ornaments; some even viewed morality as a stumbling block to progress. Moral values were deemed outdated and inefficient—so long as laws were continuously improved, all issues could supposedly be resolved efficiently. [The remaining task, they believed, was simply to "greedily" pursue wealth]().  

The desire to engage in cooperation with grabbing mindsets and achieve altruistic outcomes with self-interested motives is indeed noble and effective in the short term, but it is highly perilous in the long run. This argument faces at least two major issues:  

First, the success of the market economy is not tied to selfishness—selfishness is not a prerequisite for market success. On the contrary, individuals with strong altruistic instincts can more thoroughly advance market development. The market economy merely redirects the inherent drive of three-dimensional life forms to pursue self-interest into a force for altruism and cooperation.  

Second, the value system that equates selfish greed with virtue, encouraging self-interest and personal value maximization, will profoundly impact humanity’s evolutionary trajectory. From the large-scale perspective of Adversarial Evolution, encouraging self-interest—especially tolerating those who accumulate wealth and achieve success through grabbing or unscrupulous means—will rapidly expand the proportion of grabbing genes in society, leading to reverse selection. This will severely endanger humanity’s long-term development.  

When we unreservedly trust the "invisible hand" to handle everything and equate material success with overall success, we are merely deceiving ourselves.

Judging from the current outcomes, the set of market economy theories pioneered by *The Wealth of Nations* is both ingenious and effective. If all of us start from self-interest to achieve altruistic results—under the constraints of law and guided by rationality, maximizing personal interests while benefiting others—it indeed appears perfect. It enables all individuals, regardless of Virtue and Evil, to participate extensively in social division of labor and cooperation. Over the past few centuries, it has indeed shaped highly developed Western societies, and upon its introduction to Chinese society, it has also yielded unprecedented economic achievements unseen in millennia. However, we must not overlook that the market economy fundamentally relies on the public’s sense of rule-abiding, instinct for integrity, and mindset of mutual benefit and cooperation. These moral instincts are fundamentally opposed to Individualism. Driven by extreme self-interest and the maximization of individual interests, individuals will inevitably seek to breach rules and integrity to pursue excessive profits, even resorting to Grabbingism to achieve their ends. The "invisible hand" of the market is neither omniscient nor omnipotent; on the contrary, its capabilities are quite limited, often depending on the self-discipline and ideological awareness of market participants—especially in fields like antitrust, intellectual property, and finance, where Grabbingist means are highly covert and complex. In a group where Grabbingism prevails and rules are disregarded, the market economy will inevitably lack the soil for healthy development.  

[If we exalt Individualism and the maximization of personal interests while disregarding the long-term cultivation of moral instincts, this trend of prioritizing trivial matters over essentials could potentially overshadow and squander all the resplendence and achievements that the market economy has thus far attained.]  

[The greatest innovation of the market economy may also become its greatest harm: it creates the illusion that self-interest, rather than reciprocal altruism, can bring about significant progress and a bright future for human society.]  

### Neglecting Instinct Cultivation and Disregarding the Long-Term Value of Intentional Morality  
This potent "market economy remedy," designed to achieve reciprocal cooperation by starting from self-interest, harbors profound dangers beneath its shining achievements. It deeply excavates and unleashes humanity’s self-interested instincts, significantly incentivizing self-serving genes, allowing the most rational and resolute genetic strategies of maximizing personal interests to succeed supremely. From the perspective of rational personal interest maximization, Virtue-Upholding is meaningless—they need not care about the justice of means, only the maximization of results and benefits. Abiding by the law is merely a means to their end of maximizing interests; if breaking the law yields greater benefits, they have no reason to comply. Evil-Rejection is even more unnecessary for them; from the standpoint of personal interest maximization, they should not spend time or energy on evils not directly inflicted upon themselves.  

[For them, focusing solely on their own concerns is the behavior that maximizes their interests; being indifferent and snobbish is the inevitable choice for maximizing personal interests; and acts such as dismantling the bridge after crossing the river or repaying kindness with enmity are merely rational behaviors born of their calculated assessments of the situation. Whether it be Grabbingism, Hypocrisyism, fawning servility, honeyed words with a stinging heart, swindling, or operating sweatshops—so long as these enable their success, they will perform their required roles with the utmost "piety and rationality."]  

In the short term, "results" may appear favorable: the market economy at least compels self-serving, Grabbingist, and Hypocrisyist individuals to engage in altruistic behavior under legal constraints in most cases. However, this mechanism makes maximal compromises on genetic instincts. Such compromises are akin to quelling thirst with poison—they cannot truly stem the spread and proliferation of Hypocrisyist and Grabbingist genes. The instincts of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection receive no support from the market mechanism, let alone the formation of long-term positive selection. If one day Grabbingism yields higher expected benefits than cooperation, "rational economic agents" will unhesitatingly shift to Grabbingism over cooperation. For them, within the framework of institutions and laws, maximizing their own interests is natural—they may even calculate probabilistic maximization, trampling laws to pursue excessive profits. Under a pure market economy, these genes will rise to prominence and spread rapidly.  

[Meanwhile, genes that sincerely uphold Virtue will only bind themselves, facing elimination. In the market economy’s winner-takes-all dynamic, any hint of Evil that evades legal punishment, or any trace of Virtue that becomes a burden, will tip the scales of success.]  

[To evaluate the merits of an action, we must assess not only the "Cooperative Dividend" it currently generates and the potential "Grabbing Deficit" it may incur, but also its potential and probability of releasing "Cooperative Dividend" and causing "Grabbing Deficit" in the foreseeable future. This is the core thinking mode of Adversarial Evolution.]  

Though historical facts often reflect humanity’s lack of, or even poor, long-term foresight—largely due to neglecting the variable of Adversarial Evolution’s environmental changes—the course of history is often dominated by "short-term advantages" and the Matthew Effect, such that short-sighted decisions often exert long-lasting influence. Nevertheless, humanity must continuously enhance its long-term foresight and its capacity for timely self-reflection and adjustment. The decline of moral instincts is a proposition that demands our utmost attention. From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the weakening of moral instincts is a perilous process: we know that the establishment of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection is extremely difficult, and once it wanes, restoration becomes arduous. These self-interested, personal-interest-maximizing genes, within institutional gray areas, legal ambiguities, or when benefits outweigh legal constraints, will unleash immeasurable destructive power. We see this in the East India Company’s overseas colonization, various acts of aggression and wars in modern history, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and the behaviors of merchants who trample laws, exploit legal loopholes, or operate in gray zones to pursue excessive profits. Owing to the loss of moral instincts, the foundation of humanity as a four-dimensional life form is precarious.  

In truth, the moral instincts of mutual benefit and cooperation have always been a critical spiritual pillar of the market economy. Though this soft pillar is less straightforward and effective than law, it supports the market economy’s operations in all aspects with its all-encompassing subtlety, significantly reducing Cooperation Maintenance Cost. Conversely, without moral support, the market economy reveals innumerable flaws. For instance, China’s A-share market has long harbored many poor-quality companies with abysmal qualifications, yet they succeed in raising substantial funds, which are nearly squandered on executive salaries. These companies even pass the scrutiny of underwriters and listing auditors.  

[Even under a highly sound system, individual moral deficiencies can be mitigated by law and mechanisms, but widespread moral deficiencies easily create loopholes. Take the separation of powers: if all branches disregard morality and justice and collude, what use are legal mechanisms? In a group with low moral instincts, the market economy incurs enormous costs in legal construction and regulation.]  

This is why the market economy struggles to function healthily in many third-world countries. Though humanity possesses strong self-reflective capabilities and culture profoundly influences behavior, the primitive impulses of human instincts—determined by genes—are like sprouting seeds, surging with immense energy in all unguarded moments and fleeting thoughts, driving people to fulfill their "will."  

[The market economy belongs to a results-oriented paradigm, while moral instincts belong to a motivation- or intent-oriented paradigm.]  

These two paradigms each have flaws but could complement and enhance one another. It is unnecessary for some to artificially divide them, favoring one over the other.  

[Perhaps now, more than ever, we should remain vigilant and examine from a longer temporal span: motivation determines long-term results, which are more important than short-term outcomes.]  

[The evolutionary outcomes of genetic "intentions" will largely determine humanity’s future destiny. Relying solely on the "invisible hand" of the market and law to solve all problems while neglecting the evolutionary trends of the genetic "intentions" underlying them is superficial, short-sighted, and dangerous.]  

PS: I must reiterate here that the terms "morality" and "Virtue" mentioned in this book do not refer to traditional morality and Virtue, but to definitions derived from the theory of Adversarial Evolution. For specifics, refer to the essay "The Adversarial Evolutionary Definition of 'Virtue'" in the first volume.  

### The Boundaries of Justice Always Age  
[Whether overemphasizing Individualism or neglecting the importance of instinct cultivation and intentional morality, the root cause often lies in viewing the world through a static lens, disregarding the trends of Adversarial Evolution.]  

As I have repeatedly emphasized in this book, the boundaries of justice always age—all existing rules are limited and cannot address rapidly evolving market behaviors. Only the "Virtue" instinct can spawn infinite market rules to regulate emerging market issues. For example, analyzing the employer-employee relationship through a simple economic model may seem perfect: employers and employees establish a bidirectional selection relationship. Employees can choose good employers and eliminate bad ones; employers can select good employees and eliminate poor ones.

However, modern large - scale enterprises feature multi - layered structures, with intricate factional and corrupt issues, and complex game relationships between different levels. For instance, some middle - level managers and subordinates collude to cover for each other, engaging in corruption to exploit the company. On the surface, employees can threaten to resign to demand higher salaries, and employers can dismiss those who are not hard - working. But in actual operations, some leaders prefer to make honest employees take the blame and pick on the "soft targets," as they are less likely to resist strongly, making it easier to shift responsibility, and the team appears more harmonious and stable, focusing on avoiding mistakes rather than achieving merits, after all, they are constrained by 360 - degree evaluations. This indirectly encourages the trend of "the one who makes a fuss gets their way."

Additionally, some individuals are adept at instigating struggles between departments and functions, regardless of right or wrong, and blindly safeguarding the interests of their own departments and leaders, becoming "tools" for some middle - level managers. Although these people contribute nothing constructive, they are sharp weapons for internal strife and may even be promoted. Furthermore, there are "actor - type" employees who slack off or even disappear during regular working hours, but precisely time their posts on social media during holidays or late at night to project an image of working all night. There are also employees who fawn over leaders on a daily basis, maintain a superficial harmony with rivals with conflicting interests, but whisper slanders in the leaders' ears, speaking sweetly while harboring malice, distorting facts, and eventually attacking rivals through plausible small reports and groundless slanders at opportune moments.

As companies grow larger and the stakes increase, they breed and attract these Hypocrisyists and Grabbingists, which is how most "big - company diseases" emerge. Under such trends, it is the capable employees who are often eliminated. Moreover, employees do not have complete freedom in choosing employers either. There are non - compete agreements, threats of permanent employment blacklisting, and so on. Not to mention that the nature of some jobs results in employees having narrow skill sets, making it difficult for them to find suitable jobs. This forces everyone to learn skills that are beneficial for job - hopping, which is wise for individuals but detrimental to enterprises and the development of the entire market. The simple proposition of the traditional two - way selection between employers and employees has been completely distorted.

In the end, it is often the Grabbingists and Hypocrisyists, those who are unwilling to make sacrifices for collective interests, those who only care about their own interests, and even those who are manipulative and good at internal strife; those who "cry loudly" and disregard the overall situation that can seize more benefits. Those who are willing to take on dirty and tiring work, those with strong team responsibility, and those who dare to take responsibility and innovate often do not get their due rewards in most enterprises.

Furthermore, competition between companies has also become distorted under the short - sighted and profit - maximizing economic philosophy. Businesses that pursue high quality, excellent design, superior materials, and investment in research and development are squeezed out of the market by counterfeiters, those who sell substandard products, engage in false advertising, and make a quick profit. The tried - and - tested method of first occupying the market through price wars and then secretly reducing quality to make huge profits is widespread. In the market economy system, achieving commercial success through grabbing rather than creation is not without space, and this space is growing larger. Market monopolies and enterprises with no technical content, which are disdainful to those with ideals and aspirations, "benefit greatly" in a low - competition environment with huge market dividends, and some even make money effortlessly. In this way, the market economy also fails to achieve the original intention of "rewarding virtue."

Some claim that market regulations can solve these problems, [but there is a contradiction between the meticulousness of market regulations and business innovation](). Currently, many regulations in the Chinese market are already extremely detailed, which has greatly restricted business innovation, yet it is still difficult to stop the commercial behavior of bad money driving out good money. In a market environment with higher moral instincts, there would be far fewer contradictions and dilemmas. By studying and observing the Chinese market, we can see that many problems that Western markets will face in the future have already played out in the Chinese market in advance.

### "Rule Overfitting" - Secondary Crime
[The theory of "moral uselessness" often stems from the idea that we only need to respect market rules and legal systems, and within the constraints of rules and laws, we can disregard morality.]() Some even believe that within these rules and constraints, we should be as self - interested as possible, attack competitors, and be profit - driven. As long as you achieve success within the constraints of the rules, you are worthy of affirmation. They think this is beneficial to market competition and economic development. What is more, this trend has further developed into the belief that as long as a person does not explicitly violate the law in market economic activities, or even if they explicitly violate the law, as long as a lawyer can exonerate them, that is, as long as the person makes money and achieves profits from the market, then they are successful. This is actually a very naive and dangerous idea. Many rules and regulations formulated in the market only deter the honest, not the unscrupulous. If you insist on challenging the boundaries of the rules, you can always find loopholes for grabbing. As the saying goes, "a person without shame is invincible."

For example, the "seven - day no - questions - asked return" rule is an important protection for the rights and interests of online shoppers, and it has actually supported the huge prosperity of China's online shopping market in recent years. Through this rule, consumers dare to boldly purchase goods online without being overly worried about merchant fraud. This is originally a trading rule and guarantee that benefits both buyers and sellers. However, it has some loopholes. For instance, recently, students from a school in Shanxi Province collectively purchased some clothes online, wore them for a group performance, and then collectively applied for no - questions - asked returns. There are also internet celebrities who buy 18 pieces of clothing at once, use them for tourism, and then apply for returns. There are even online groups that specially study how to successfully return worn clothes to merchants and share their successful experiences on forums, which are imitated and追捧 by others. Do these people violate the law or trading rules? No, but their actions are a form of grabbing behavior. There are not a few people who take advantage of rule loopholes to make profits, and even small rule loopholes have considerable grabbing space.

A college student in Shandong exploited the unspoken rule that online food purchases with problems would result in free orders or even compensation, and in one year, he continuously purchased food on various online platforms 43 times, put prepared bugs into the food, and extorted more than 7,000 yuan in compensation. The "hair - pulling claim" incident of a woman in Weifang, Shandong, in a restaurant further demonstrates how unrestrained such behavior can be when it is divorced from moral and instinctive constraints, with minimal effort bringing benefits. These behaviors cause huge damage to market order and lead to significant grabbing deficits. These people are not unintelligent; on the contrary, they are too intelligent. They also do not violate the rules, but [they comply with the external form of the rules while violating the internal spirit of the rules. Once rules are turned into specific clauses and concretized, they are difficult to be comprehensive and seamless.]()

Some may think that the above - mentioned behaviors have a negligible impact on the total economic volume, but more things that violate the spirit of the rules and affect the entire market logic are constantly happening. For example, the A - share trading rule is T + 1, meaning that stocks bought on the same day can only be sold on the next trading day. This is to avoid trading involution, that is, profiting through frequent short - term operations, because such operations force other traders to keep a close eye on the market. Otherwise, when some news is known to everyone at the same time, being preempted by others will be a disadvantage. However, some professional players bypass this rule through securities lending, making their operations effectively close to T + 0, allowing them to quickly buy and sell stocks. Combined with程序化 trading tools, they can achieve the goal of high - frequency quantitative trading. In this way, they violate the original intention of the rule formulation and seize benefits in an involutionary way. The overall profit may be the same, but the overall cost has increased significantly.

[Rules are static, and past precedents are also static. They can never plug all loopholes, while people are dynamic and have strong logical and moral judgment abilities, which is the earliest and most important function of the human brain. Only by relying on people with moral instincts as the final layer of protection, not just on the rules themselves, can we truly avoid grabbing deficits.]()[Therefore, groups with higher moral instincts, or higher - dimensional awareness, have much lower rule costs than groups with lower - dimensional awareness, thus having higher potential for cooperative dividends and smaller losses from grabbing deficits.]()

### Scarcity - The Inherent Market Value of Evil
As the saying goes, "things are valuable because they are rare," which well explains that scarcity is an important means of achieving success in the market economy. "Evil" is precisely scarce in a society, and the more extreme the evil, the greater its scarcity, and thus the higher its implicit market value. For example, in the live - streaming industry, what makes the most money is live - streaming what most people are unwilling to live - stream, and immoral behavior has natural scarcity. Therefore, live - streamers who broadcast vulgar, self - abusive, and perverse content often make a lot of money. For example, making fake certificates earns more than making real ones, printing money earns more than anything else, drug trafficking can have a ten - thousand - fold premium over cost, and the black market trade in people and organs is even more expensive. Under the rules of the market economy, market behaviors that satisfy evil demands have a potentially extremely high premium. If everyone aims to maximize their own interests, then market behaviors that satisfy such demands will become their optimal choice, and they will not hesitate to bribe or assassinate to clear obstacles.

Some may naively think that as long as the builders and maintainers of market order can formulate good order and enforce it well, evil will not thrive. But if everyone aims to maximize their own interests, what reason do the maintainers of market order have to sacrifice their own interests and risk their lives to formulate and maintain market order?

### The Market Economy Is Deceiving You—It Only Shows You What You Want to See  
The entire mechanism of the market economy is essentially designed to be driven by the demands of economic agents. This design is ingeniously crafted and, for the most part, propels societal development. Over the past century or two, it has achieved remarkable, even surpassing-expectation results in practical social applications and driving substantive progress. There is no denying that this mechanism holds true in 90% of scenarios, as each individual best understands their own needs and should be accountable for their choices. The foundational assumption of the market economy is that every rational person is self-responsible and sufficiently wise. Yet reality diverges from this ideal: the "rationality" of "rational agents" is often deficient—otherwise, *How to Win Friends and Influence People* (a book dissecting human weaknesses) would not remain a perennial bestseller.  

The essence of the market economy’s deception lies in exploiting your short-sightedness and weaknesses of human nature to manipulate you into self-deception. It merely amplifies such short-sightedness. Examples include student loans, online gambling, P2P lending, investment scams, and various Ponzi schemes—all rooted in the "rational choices" of their participants. Broader still, games, live streaming, certain films, TV shows, and online novels all profit by capitalizing on human frailties. This approach is inevitably more effective and quicker than any other means of making money. Eventually, the entire social culture becomes hostage to these weaknesses. Noble voices are silenced, while trivial ones clamor—this is the tragic and alarming predicament already facing our society.  

Of course, one might adopt a Social Darwinist perspective: those unable to take responsibility for their actions or lacking self-judgment deserve to be淘汰 (eliminated) by society. As the "brains" of human society, intellectual workers presumably possess higher rationality and stronger judgment, enabling them to act rationally in market behaviors. But should manual laborers be doomed to be deceived and exploited through these human weaknesses? A return to the perspective of Cooperative Ascension reveals the fallacy of this view. Maximizing social benefits hinges on division of labor and cooperation; if manual laborers were required to possess complex rational thinking, this would itself represent a dimensional downgrade and a reduction in cooperative dividends.  

History has repeatedly validated this. The decline of Athens, the French Revolution, and the rise of Nazism all serve as stark reminders. Why has direct democracy, which initially seems so appealing, repeatedly failed in human societies? Why did Plato write *The Republic*, Tocqueville *The Old Regime and the Revolution*, and Le Bon *The Crowd*—all expressing profound skepticism toward the judgment of the masses? We must recognize that every unit and organ in our bodies is heterogeneous. Even if they share common goals, their "structures differ despite shared aspirations." Specialized tasks should be entrusted to specialized, moral individuals—this is the trajectory of life. A compassionate, healthy social mechanism should leave you grateful in hindsight, its warmth lingering for years, rather than exhilarating you in the moment only to leave you remorseful afterward, like all Ponzi schemes. A good mechanism should not merely show you what you desire, only to reveal its flaws after you’ve paid; it should, after prolonged use, make you realize your initial desires were insufficient—and deliver more than you wanted.  

### The Market Serves Only Short-Sighted Interests  
A core tenet of the market economy is that every economic agent is sufficiently rational, capable of acting in their long-term interests, and endowed with strong judgment. Yet in reality, most people lack such judgment. While they are not exactly "the mob," the majority often lack foresight to discern what benefits their long-term individual interests—let alone consider genetic interests. If the market is left to exploit human weaknesses, industries like vice (gambling, drugs, prostitution), Ponzi schemes, and their variants will inevitably become the easiest ways to profit. Many succumb to temptation or deception, losing their fortunes. Though this process aligns with the "willing buyer, willing seller" principle, the outcome clearly deviates from the market economy’s original intent.  

Some might argue that these individuals, with their poor judgment, weak self-control, and lack of ambition, deserve to be淘汰 by the market. This is classic Social Darwinism, which is deeply flawed within the framework of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension. From a cross-dimensional analogy, humans are likely evolving toward finer division of labor. Requiring manual laborers to maintain a complex, highly rational mind and continuously learn to avoid societal pitfalls is inefficient from a group-benefit perspective. Intellectual inadequacy is not a reason for elimination—otherwise, chickens, dogs, cows, and sheep would all have been淘汰 long ago; they are merely victims of善意 deception (benevolent deception). Only广义的恶 (broadly defined evil) must be淘汰. Thus, intellectual workers, with their stronger analytical abilities, should endeavor to protect non-intellectual laborers—for without them, the "lips" (intellectuals) would perish once the "teeth" (manual laborers) are lost.  

From the perspective of Dimension Ascension and cooperative division of labor, [each individual’s rationality is limited; their knowledge, experience, and physical capabilities are suited only to their specialized productive roles. The less they need to master skills unrelated to their roles, the greater the cooperative dividends generated by division of labor.]() It is therefore unrealistic to demand that every individual possess full scientific, economic, and legal expertise. To do so would represent a massive loss to human social efficiency. [Consequently, the assumption that every economic agent is sufficiently rational often fails.]() When individuals make choices based purely on their own desires, information asymmetry, PUA manipulation, exploitation of human weaknesses, deception, and other factors can lead them to select options harmful to their long-term interests—especially their genetic interests.  

[Humanity’s rapid technological and cognitive advancements have not significantly reduced survival pressures—because they must now counteract the counterforces generated by these very advancements.]() Pyramid schemes, telecom fraud, the unreliability of both hearing and sight—these are all products of high technology and advanced cognition being weaponized for evil. Meanwhile, unbridled marketization, lacking mainstream media guidance, mainstream values, and a sense of collective identity, results in the noble being discarded and the trivial dominating. The market economy often serves only the short-term interests of economic agents. For instance, developing a product requires substantial investment, but counterfeit manufacturers can produce it at a fraction of the cost. Consumers, acting "rationally" to maximize their own interests by choosing the cheapest option, inadvertently淘汰 innovative companies. In the end, these consumers lose access to higher-quality goods.  

Even the core logic underpinning the market economy’s effectiveness—[the greater the social value created, the greater the reward]()—often fails. Due to the manipulability and immediacy of rewards, only actions that rapidly generate social value are incentivized. For example, writing books or teaching—endeavors that generate profound long-term social value—receive inadequate recompense. Among such pursuits, online novels and fantastical tales, which cater to猎奇心理 (curiosity) and have broad, consumptive audiences, yield significant returns. In contrast, books that critique societal issues, offer grand visions, or possess depth—though they may profoundly transform human society in the future—struggle to find reward today due to their esoteric nature. Similarly, teaching methods that quickly boost exam scores and secure college admissions receive substantial economic rewards, while those that truly enhance personal quality and moral character are marginalized due to lack of market demand.  

Moreover, self-interested individuals tend to purchase goods that aid their Grabbingism. Though these goods have negative social value, and their producers are also inclined toward Grabbingism, they profit handsomely. This violates the principle that greater social value begets greater reward—a latent flaw in the market mechanism. In the market economy, those seeking profit must deify users as "gods," allowing these "gods" to dictate market trends. Yet this "god" may well be *The Crowd*.  

We do not deny that much market activity yields positive outcomes. However, when market success becomes the sole criterion for success, it is akin to placing "the mob" at the helm of human civilization. This is both irresponsible to human civilization and a form of捧杀 (excessive flattery leading to ruin) for these non-"brain cells" who should not bear the burden of guiding civilization. For too long, human systems have merely harnessed instincts and catered to human nature—a transitional state that is insufficient and, at times, akin to draining a pond to catch fish, yielding counterproductive results. For human society to endure, we must instead reshape instincts and human nature; otherwise, society will collapse amid a degenerative spiral of Grabbingism.  

### Market Behaviors Are Hostage to Profit Models

The two points mentioned earlier pertain to buyer behavior being "kidnapped" by sellers; this section, however, concerns seller behavior being "kidnapped" by buyers. For those who have drafted business plans, profit models and market size are essential components of such documents. Among these, profit models often prove the most perplexing, as they involve the critical question of how to induce customers to pay. No matter how significant the social value or potential economic benefits a project generates, it will be spurned by the market economy and capital if it lacks a viable profit model. For instance, high-quality single-player games are being displaced by online games where users pay for ostentation or a sense of superiority; painstakingly crafted TV dramas are being replaced by drawn-out ones designed solely to accommodate more advertisements. Certain profit models thrive not because they genuinely create substantial social value, but simply because they make it easier to collect payments—examples include the advertising economy and the idol economy.  

Today, profit models have further devolved into a race to the bottom, exploiting the human weakness of wanting to gain more than one contributes. In an era of hyper-competitive market involution, the "panacea" of Ponzi schemes has once again gained traction. Capital employs tactics such as predatory pricing—subsidizing initial losses to drive out competitors, then raising prices to recoup costs after achieving monopolistic dominance—repeating this playbook endlessly. Alternatively, entities may win market share through counterfeiting, false advertising, boundary-pushing practices, or the "bad money driving out good money" dynamic. In today’s Chinese market, consumers have grown accustomed to the disillusioning experience of initially perceiving a deal as highly favorable, only to feel cheated post-transaction. Even when cheated, they often lack the motivation to resist, having resigned themselves to the maxim "you get what you pay for"—though a flicker of hope lingers that they might one day encounter a genuine, deeply discounted offer. Platforms exploit this lingering hope to repeatedly deceive them.  

### The Market’s "Shooter Effect" and the Matthew Effect  
Those who ultimately claim victory often become the focus of public attention, reaping acclaim and admiration. Take soccer: while defenders are equally critical and skilled, public attention disproportionately fixates on forwards—the "shooters" who directly score goals. This exemplifies the "Shooter Effect," which reveals society’s tendency to reward overt, quantifiable achievements, exacerbating the Matthew Effect (the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer). However, the intrinsic value of glory earned through the Shooter Effect may not align with its external rewards. The internal logic of the market economy inadvertently reinforces this bias, assuming high earners deserve reverence and their genetic traits should be amplified, while low earners are marginalized.  

Even in an idealized market with perfect mechanisms to measure individual social contributions, economic success alone should not be the sole criterion for judging personal worth or the desirability of genetic transmission. Within the complex network of social division of labor, the Shooter Effect ensures that only a few elites stand in the spotlight, yet this does not make them the most well-rounded or exceptional. Behind their brilliance often lie countless unsung contributors. Though inconspicuous, these supporting roles are indispensable; their genetic diversity may be more valuable, as over-replicating "star" individuals would destabilize the system, lacking necessary support and complementarity, and fostering destructive internal competition rather than genuine value creation.  

This mirrors MOBA games, where an excess of "Carry" (damage-dealing) roles unbalances the team, while excellent supports are key to victory. Just as a thoroughbred horse, though swift, is not suited to all contexts, seemingly ordinary individuals with unremarkable abilities may exhibit incalculable value in specific scenarios. The story of the Hobbits illustrates this: their resilience, optimism, and unwavering attachment to the simplicity and goodness of the Shire—qualities that resist corruption by desire and evil—proved irreplaceable in critical moments. By contrast, the tragedy of the dinosaur era, marked by low species diversity, rendered the ecosystem fragile in the face of environmental upheaval, ultimately leading to a global mass extinction. A high-dimensional life form requires precisely such a complex division of labor, with individuals of diverse capabilities who complement one another. Human society aspires to this ideal of pluralistic coexistence—harmonious yet distinct. Every person, regardless of their abilities or status, should shine in their own domain, collectively weaving a vibrant, dynamic social tapestry. This is the harmonious, cooperative era we truly seek.  

### Group Grabbingism and the "Enforcer" Phenomenon in the Market Economy  
Current market economic systems and corporate structures have proven conspicuously limited in curbing Group Grabbingism. While legal frameworks such as anti-monopoly, anti-dumping, and patent laws aim to safeguard fair competition among enterprises, unfair competition across businesses, industries, and even national borders persists. Driven by the pursuit of maximal corporate and national interests, the use of unethical competitive tactics, malicious exclusion of rivals, and attempts to achieve monopolistic dominance are even viewed as "sophisticated" strategies to shift internal conflicts and maintain internal harmony.  

In recent years, numerous corporate examples of Group Grabbingism—particularly financial fraud—abound. Cases include the Enron scandal, the Madoff investment fraud, Allen Stanford’s Ponzi scheme, and the AEI scam in the U.S., alongside frequent pyramid schemes and P2P platform collapses in China. These reveal the prevalence and harm of collective, collusive external fraud. As a distorted application of collective intelligence, Group Grabbingism employs more covert and cunning methods than individual grabbing. Such actions often masquerade as altruistic—like Ponzi schemes, which start with small rewards to lure victims gradually. The proliferation of such organizations and companies, coupled with increasing regulatory difficulty, is masked to some extent by technology-driven productivity and wealth growth.  

To gain an edge in this Group Grabbing game, some companies rely on "enforcers" with low moral thresholds. Motivated by corporate and personal interests, these enforcers disrupt market order and abuse power internally. Despite the damage they cause to corporate reputations and market environments, senior management often condones or even encourages their actions to counter similar "enforcers" among competitors. Thus, market competition fails to promote positive selection of high-cooperation groups; instead, it nurtures pathological individuals adept at both group and individual grabbing, subverting the market economy’s intended goal of Virtue Selection. Current market systems are ill-equipped to address these issues, necessitating deeper reforms and innovations to restore fairness, transparency, and healthy development.  

### The Unviable "Second Half" of the Market Economy  
We have repeatedly argued that the Cooperative Dividend is the fundamental driver of the development and prosperity of life communities. Individualistic market economies, through the "invisible hand," compel economic agents to pursue cooperative goals—even though their actions stem from extreme self-interest rather than genuine cooperation. This resembles the role of religion in human development: most religions use unfulfillable "carrots" (e.g., the afterlife, Judgment Day) to incentivize virtuous behavior and promote individual cooperation. Thus, before the rise of the market economy, successful civilizations often relied on successful religions.  

Here, we must clarify a common bias: "Eastern peoples are more collectivist, while Western peoples are more individualistic." East Asian peoples—specifically the Chinese—once possessed robust moral values that supported the prosperity and longevity of the Zhou Dynasty. For millennia, the Chinese have emphasized morality and collectivism, yet for this ancient civilization, the degree of Individual Cancerization has grown severe, and its actual moral standards are far from ideal. In contrast, Western success does not stem solely from the exaltation of Individualism but from a foundation of strong social ethics, rule consciousness, and innovative spirit—factors that collectively sustain market prosperity.  

However, while Individualism initially drives market dynamism and competition, it harbors profound long-term consequences, akin to the pitfalls of religion—ideologies built on false premises eventually collapse. [Emphasizing Individualism makes it nearly inevitable that later-stage market economies will face monopolistic dominance, drastic wealth inequality, and the rise of financial tycoons and merchant elites who leverage their capital and connections to control companies, markets, and even nations in pursuit of maximal personal gain.]() Even if some genuine business elites refuse to complicit, disdaining such practices and maintaining integrity, they cannot halt the "bad money driving out good money" dynamic as others pursue these ambitions relentlessly. Over time, upward mobility in large corporations is stifled, market vitality wanes, and national interests are held hostage. The illusion of plugging these leaks through law alone will ultimately shatter.  

### The Blurred Line Between Competition and Grabbingism  
We have repeatedly distinguished between competition and grabbingism in this book, and the market economy is no exception. To date, people still conflate competition with grabbingism, pushing healthy competitive relationships into dangerous grabbing dynamics in individual, corporate, and national behaviors. Promoting competition does not legitimize grabbingism or exalt self-interest as a virtue. We must therefore clearly demarcate competition from grabbingism, upholding the spirit of competition while rejecting the vices of grabbingism.

The denuding of competition of grabbing tendencies remains a long and arduous journey—this holds true for individuals, enterprises, and nations alike.  

### Clarification  
I must clarify: while I have critiqued the drawbacks of the Market Economy through a structure of first praising then critiquing, I in no way negate its significance. This is why I dedicated considerable space to expounding its functions and advancements. Whenever I reflect on the mechanism of the Market Economy, my heart swells with admiration—it has opened a brand-new chapter in human history and partially addressed the intractable problem of Hypocrisyism. To date, we have yet to find a better mechanism than the Market Economy to resolve such issues. It has mitigated and alleviated many problems, yet its fundamental flaw lies in this: [a system rooted in Individualism cannot resolve Prisoner’s Dilemma problems]. As demonstrated in the first volume of this book, only by transcending Individualism, ascending to a higher dimension, and making decisions from an overarching perspective can we fundamentally address Prisoner’s Dilemma-type issues. A Market Economy that transcends Individualism is the one with genuine promise. For the essence of the Market Economy does not depend on Individualism; its secret to great success lies precisely in achieving better "Collectivism" through more quantified and precise Virtue Selection mechanisms.  

Notably, all systems—including the Rites of Zhou, Confucianism, Legalism, religion, and the Market Economy—follow the natural law of rise and decline. Each has shone brightly in different historical periods, yet all inevitably face boundary limitations and challenges of transformation. Such changes often stem from the forces of Adversarial Evolution, largely driven by the gravitational pull of grabbing tendencies that relentlessly seek to breach all barriers. Only by recognizing the positive roles of a system can we discern its potential negative impacts; only by recognizing its negatives can we maximize and prolong its positives. No rigid mechanism is perfect. The boundaries of justice will always grow old. Under the overarching trend of Adversarial Evolution—the "Virtue Selection" mechanisms that arose to solve past problems will gradually lose efficacy over time. This applies to traditional morality as it does to the Market Economy, for grabbing strategies are constantly evolving, like water seeping through every crevice to find fertile ground. Once we recognize the flaws in mechanisms such as the Market Economy, law, and corporations, I believe that with humanity’s wisdom and self-reflective spirit, and with clear-headedness and purpose, we will one day find solutions.  

## Negation of Negation of Negation—Converging Through Different Paths  
From my perspective as a non-expert, the evolution of modern economics has roughly followed the thought trajectories of Adam Smith, Marx, Keynes, Hayek, and Nash. This process is essentially one of negation of negation of negation. Since Smith’s *The Wealth of Nations*, through the refinement and propagation of market economy theories by Ricardo and Marshall, and over a century of capitalist practice, humanity has increasingly recognized that the "invisible hand" of the market has driven monumental progress. Yet over this century, the "boundaries of justice" of capitalism and the Market Economy have also been eroded; beneath its glittering surface lies a menacing undercurrent. Marx was the first to systematically analyze the essence of these issues—the exploitation of surplus value—and penned *Capital*. Meanwhile, the bourgeoisie themselves identified flaws in the free market. Keynes proposed that governments should use monetary and fiscal policies to intervene during economic overheating or cooling, to ensure healthier market development. His theories proved effective in the New Deal and many subsequent social practices. Hayek, however, vehemently opposed planned economies and Collectivism, even criticizing Keynesianism. He believed the free market possesses sufficient self-regulatory capacity, and he deeply distrusted the capabilities, judgment, and self-interest of those in power—a view shaped by his early experiences. In *The Fatal Conceit*, he sought to use Group Selection theory to validate the correctness of the Market Economy and capitalism, further advocating private property, free markets, and Individualism as the cornerstones of the Market Economy.  

In recent years, with the application of Nash’s game theory to economics, humanity has finally begun to recognize the Market Economy’s impotence in the face of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. This dilemma reveals the limitations of a Market Economy premised on self-interested individuals. The Adversarial Evolution laws discussed in this book develop game theory, deepening our understanding of the Market Economy’s essence. Beyond specific academic debates, the free-market vs. planned-economy discourse is fundamentally a debate between Individualism and Collectivism in the economic realm. [For clarity, "Collectivism" here refers to prioritizing collective interests, while "Individualism" refers to prioritizing individual interests.]  

From the development of economic theories outlined above, we see that humanity’s stance on socio-economic mechanisms has oscillated between Individualism and Collectivism. In truth, as discussed in Volume I, these two are never mutually exclusive; rather, they should complement and enhance each other. Reference can be made to "Re-examining Competition and Cooperation" and "Re-examining Collectivism and Individualism" in the concluding section of Volume I. As individuals ascend in dimension, Individualism will weaken, yet individual value remains indispensable—especially for humanity, where outstanding individuals are not only vital components of the whole but also safeguards for the future. Thus, in most cases, ["often considering one’s own interests" not only aligns with Collectivism but is more consistent with Collectivism than selfless devotion to others or fleeting collective gains. This is a form of Collectivism with greater foresight. Each individual is part of the collective; failing to consider one’s own interests—or one’s role in the evolutionary process—is equivalent to neglecting the collective. Since one is their own first responsible party and guardian, they should strive for their health, family, and career. Only when each individual thrives and realizes their value, while avoiding grabbing strategies to achieve this, is the collective’s value realized. Only when it is determined that an individual’s sacrifice or contribution will enhance the collective’s long-term interests (including across multiple generations) is such sacrifice worthwhile and beneficial.]  

### Group Selection and the Market Economy  
Hayek incorporated Group Selection theory into his economic arguments. Though Group Selection is not widely accepted in biology, as I elaborated in Volume I, I strongly endorse this theory and appreciate Hayek’s introduction of cultural evolution into economic sociology—a perspective consistent with this book’s framework. As this book has consistently emphasized, the evolutionary mechanisms of biological genes and cultural traditions are strikingly similar; together, they shape humanity’s social evolution. Integrating evolutionary laws into economics allows us to see further and clearer.  

#### Is Defying the Free Market an Act of Conceit?  
While I agree with much of Hayek’s thought, I must note that [his Group Selection theory is underdeveloped, mirroring the flaws in Darwinian evolution]. Both mistakenly assume that life evolves toward a roughly fixed trajectory—e.g., running faster, swimming more nimbly, flying swifter. [Consequently, Hayek asserts that mechanisms preserved by Group Selection (which he terms "spontaneous order"), such as free markets, private property, and Individualism, are scientific, and defying them is "conceited."] This conclusion, however, hinges on the assumption of an unchanging environment. In reality, life itself transforms its environment. For example, the Great Oxidation Event—driven by biological activity—completely altered the trajectory of Earth’s subsequent biological evolution. Such transformations can occur even more rapidly and profoundly through intra-species cooperation and grabbing games. [Thus, the illusion of evolution progressing toward a fixed direction arises only under relatively stable environmental conditions. Before and after Dimension Ascension, the evolutionary environment undergoes drastic changes, leading to nearly opposite trends—e.g., a shift from Individualism to Collectivism.] Therefore, we cannot naively extrapolate future trends from past phenomena or experiences, nor should we dismiss all logically sound proposals that may contradict these experiences as "conceited." [Is not the act of elevating limited evolutionary laws and empiricism to absolute truth, while deriding human rationality as conceit, itself a form of conceit?]  

In fact, the Market Economy and capitalism themselves overturned feudalism—another outcome of past Group Selection—and initially relied heavily on theoretical blueprints like Smith’s *The Wealth of Nations*.  

#### Collectivism and Self-Organization Are Not Contradictions

In the process of life's dimensional ascension, self-organization and centralized management complement and reinforce each other. Among all animal species with an extreme collectivist orientation in the biological world, self-organization remains a defining characteristic. In fact, the concept of self-organization was long ago used to describe animals like ants and bees that exhibit pronounced "collectivist" traits. The human body itself is a paragon of self-organization: though the brain serves as its "command center," the majority of the body’s operational directives are not initiated by the brain but achieved through self-organization. This includes vital life-sustaining systems such as the respiratory, digestive, immune, and endocrine systems, which function largely without the brain’s conscious awareness. However, the brain must intervene in macro-regulation when necessary—for instance, when a high fever necessitates antipyretic medication, as the self-organized immune response has become excessive and threatens life. The brain only directs the most essential life activities; otherwise, even ten brains would prove insufficient. There is no contradiction whatsoever between self-organization and collectivism. [Self-organization is, in fact, one of the most critical and necessary management mechanisms within large, complex living communities and biological systems.]  

#### Collective PUA-ism Is Not Genuine Collectivism  
The issues Hayek warned against—such as planned economies, where decision-making by a small elite leads to the subjugation of the majority—are precisely the practices that genuine collectivism vehemently opposes. [Thus, the true problem may lie in the fact that most historical "collectivist" ideologies have been mere slogans used to PUA collectives.] It can be said that all past economic experiments with collectivism were immature, even naive, riddled with loopholes, and lacking in consideration for reality and human nature. Yet we cannot thereby denounce collectivism or extol individualism. As discussed in the previous volume, past collectivist policies often displayed short-sightedness and utilitarianism, failing to account for the existence of "cancer cells" (Individual Cancerization) and the long-term effects of evolutionary trends. In essence, these practices harmed the long-term interests of collectives, which is why most achieved only transient success. [Particularly egregious are those acts that exploit the name of collectivism to coerce "good individuals" into self-sacrifice for short-term gains, without providing commensurate rewards or mechanisms to establish genetic advantages for the virtuous. Such actions are akin to killing the goose that lays the golden eggs—they are exploitative and more detrimental to collectivism than individualism itself.]  

[Group Selection is a viable framework for explaining the developmental laws of economic and social phenomena. Natural selection favors groups that generate greater Cooperative Dividends, driving humanity toward dimensional ascension and increased cooperation. Market economy, in this regard, is precisely a system that drastically enhances humanity’s Cooperative Dividend.] However, the experience of market economy is not static or stagnant. [We should refine the market economy system by further augmenting Cooperative Dividends and mitigating Grabbing Deficit.] We must remain humble before the mechanisms selected by nature and human history, [and ever vigilant toward the results of our own rational deductions. Yet we must not be complacent, assuming that standing still guarantees stability. The boundaries of justice are perpetually aging, whether in morality or law. Only by advancing with the times—daring to imagine, carefully verifying, taking small steps forward, and "crossing the river by feeling the stones"—can we progress further.]  

### Individualism Is Not a Necessity for Market Economy  
Moreover, it is unnecessary to excessively eulogize individualism and liberalism merely because we champion capitalism and market economy. The full realization of individual value and initiative is indispensable to collectivism. Thus, individualism is not an essential component of market economy. I believe individuals with collectivist instincts and outlooks can operate the market economy even more effectively. [In a sense, the success of market economy precisely attests to the success of collectivism—few other examples are as compelling. When considering collective interests, however, we must do so from an evolutionary, long-term perspective.]  

#### Is the Beautiful World Created by Individuals?  
When discussing individualism, Hayek also implied that innovative ideas often spring from individual minds, even asserting that all strategies, plans, inventions, and creations originate from individual intellects, making individuals the core drivers of human progress. But is this truly the case? Could modern humans achieve such technological and cultural feats without the transmission of knowledge through books or the instruction of teachers? Even if a person spent their entire life discovering the law of inertia or calculus, they would be a once-in-a-century genius. Yet they would still remain vastly distant from relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear fusion, computer technology, or genetic engineering. Modern science is like building blocks, constructed by generations of scientists, each building upon the work of their predecessors. This is even more evident in the era of the computer revolution. The sophisticated software we use today relies on a complex hierarchy of abstraction: from machine instructions to assembly language, operating systems, foundational libraries, application frameworks, scripting languages, and WYSIWYG editors—only then can an application be supported. This requires the cumulative efforts of generations of computer geniuses and experts, countless elegant algorithm designs, and innumerable foundational contributions, all converging to enable the digital age. The computer field has no shortage of geniuses, but it is entirely impossible for any single genius to independently recreate its current achievements from scratch.  

Additionally, extending the ethos of freedom from the economic to the social sphere, and elevating isolated cases into universal faiths and worship of freedom, is profoundly dangerous. Today, anarchism and totalitarianism are equally perilous and cruel.  

#### The Prisoner’s Dilemma Reveals the Root of Individualism’s Problem  
Critiquing individualism and refuting the theory of a completely free market economy is not difficult—one need only introduce game theory. In a completely free market, under all conditions analogous to the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the optimal choice derived from the perspective of free markets and individual profit maximization (i.e., the rational economic actor) leads to the Nash equilibrium point. However, the Nash equilibrium is not the optimal solution for the whole. There are three solutions: first, direct macro-intervention with a "visible hand" to achieve a global optimum beyond individual self-interest; second, macro-intervention to alter rules such that individual optimal choices align with the global optimum; third, and most thorough, cultivating human instincts to prioritize the global optimum over individual self-interest when necessary. Since the market economy cannot be all-encompassing or airtight, its healthy operation requires alignment with human instincts and consciousness. All three approaches—macro-intervention, rule-making, and moral cultivation—demand the involvement of macro-level forces.  

As I have previously noted, a purely planned economy is certainly inferior to a free market economy that leverages self-organization. [But I must also emphasize that a purely free market economy is certainly inferior to one that integrates planning and freedom, combining precise macro-intervention with micro-level self-organization.] In fact, Keynes, in his response to Hayek during his lifetime, argued for "a middle path, defined through quantitative means." Neither extreme ideology is tenable. [Humanity must quickly abandon the simplistic logical fallacy that "proving A is absolutely beneficial or harmful in extreme cases" justifies concluding that "A is beneficial or harmful in all cases."] We should reduce ideological disputes and instead conduct in-depth analysis and solutions based on practical outcomes and specific, detailed issues.  

#### Individualism Is Not a Necessity  
[Individualism is not required by market economy; nor is it required by individual competition or market competition.] [Genuine, far-sighted collectivism inherently includes individualism, and it will certainly enable the market economy to function even more effectively.] [Rather than asserting that market economy needs individualism, it is truer to say that, in the process of humanity’s dimensional ascension, market economy has ingeniously harnessed the deeply ingrained life traits of individual competition—a characteristic of three-dimensional life forms—to promote cooperation in practice.] [This "magical trick" was also employed in the religious era. Both constructed a "shortcut" for rapid dimensional ascension, and while this shortcut has side effects and aftershocks, it has withstood the test of certain historical cycles. If we can deeply understand its origins and mechanisms, leverage its advantages, suppress its side effects early, and realign it with instinctual cultivation, such shortcuts will not become "performance-enhancing drugs" with severe side effects in group competition, and the prosperity brought by market economy will not degrade into "drug-induced" prosperity.]  

[Stimulating and exploiting the underlying tendency toward individual grabbing is relatively easy for a three-dimensional species that has evolved and adapted to individual competition over hundreds of millions of years. However, repairing this genetic tendency is extremely difficult—virtuous instincts are arduous to establish and even harder to reconstruct. The longer Pandora’s box remains open, the more challenging it becomes to close.] [Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Individualism breeds demons; absolute individualism breeds absolute demons.]  

### Private Property and Collectivism Are Not Contradictory

### On Private Property and the Evolution of Collectivism  

When discussing private property, it is essential that each individual retains a portion of private assets, which should be protected to preserve necessary survival capabilities. This is also indispensable for collectivism. Traditional understandings often conflated collectivism with public ownership of property—a form of social organization in early human societies—but using such a model to operate large-scale groups is actually "insufficiently collectivist." This involves two distinct interpretations of collectivism:  

1. The first interpretation views collectivism as a system that prioritizes the interests of every individual within the collective. Under this framework, collectivism easily fosters egalitarianism, equal distribution, "shared pot" mentalities, and Free-Riderism.  
2. The second interpretation defines collectivism as a system that prioritizes the total interests of the collective, particularly its long-term overall interests. This understanding has given rise to utilitarianism and its variants, including the Symbiotic Communitarianism discussed later. These two interpretations of collectivism, though seemingly similar, lead to vastly divergent outcomes. The collectivism advocated in this book aligns with the latter. A public property system based on absolute equal distribution or distribution according to need would severely undermine the collective’s long-term interests. As we have repeatedly emphasized, such a mechanism benefits Free-Riders (analogous to cancerous cells in biological systems). In smaller groups, moral condemnation could mitigate the survival advantage of these individuals, but in large-scale societies, moral reproach loses efficacy. Collective egalitarianism only exacerbates harm to the collective’s long-term interests, allowing "cancerous cells" to spread rapidly. Protecting private property lawfully acquired through individual effort can address this issue to some extent.  

Drawing a cross-dimensional analogy: in three-dimensional plants and animals, each cell retains sufficient nutrients—its "private property"—to sustain its life over extended periods, while the entire organism (the collective) stores more abundant resources for necessary allocation during vital activities. For human societies, private property is even more critical, as it enables individuals to enhance their genetic advantages, thereby exerting a cancer-suppressive effect. However, Hayek’s interpretation of private property as a "fundamental natural law" or "a result of group selection" is inadequate. Similarly, phrases like "private property is inviolable" in Western constitutions, upon closer examination, are no different in essence from the historical "divine right of kings." Neither public nor private property is inviolable because of "sanctity"; rather, their allocation is determined by the needs of dimensional ascension, aiming to maximize the cooperative dividend of the entire living system. While protecting private property is important, it is far from "sacredly inviolable." In capitalist societies, violations of private property occur daily—through currency devaluation, inflation, stock market manipulation, and more. We urgently need a theory to rigorously and scientifically re-examine these internally contradictory official narratives and mainstream values.

### Respecting Experience, Guided by Reason  

Fundamentally, we observe that market economies and past religions share striking similarities: both attempt to maintain cooperative mechanisms in human groups through non-instinctual means. Consequently, both are limited, reactive, and dangerous, as they fail to establish cooperative motivations at the level of instinct. Instead, they achieve broad cooperation through expediency, short-sightedness, and temporary measures. The potential crises masked by such false prosperity will inevitably erupt.  

Admittedly, we must deeply respect the evolutionary experiences and achievements of both culture and life—human wisdom pales in comparison to the billion-year-old wisdom of evolution. Yet, facing the future, we must rely more on human reason and intellect. As dimensional ascension progresses, the number of macro-individuals within the same living space will dwindle, and the cost of evolution will soar. Two world wars have already left human society in disarray; more intense competition and conflict are unthinkable. Only by thoroughly exploring the laws of evolution itself can we avoid excessive "trial and error" and steer toward evolution’s rightful path.  

Upon deeply understanding the true roles of competition and individualism in market economies, we find their effects diametrically opposed to their literal meanings: competition selects individuals and groups with stronger cooperative capacities, thereby promoting cooperation; individualism prevents PUA and moral coercion, fostering more far-sighted collectivism. However, human nature harbors a tendency toward extremism, particularly among those who lack deep understanding and adhere to black-and-white dualistic thinking.  

Today, human society stands at a critical crossroads. Both the stable operation of market economies and the preservation of moral ethics face unprecedented challenges. At this pivotal moment, we must actively explore the integration of market logic and moral values, reducing the "step size" in our "gradient descent" and gradually converging toward balance. This is precisely when human reason must lead. Such reason must first include the capacity for self-negation. Only then can we "cross the river by feeling the stones"—admitting when we have taken the wrong path, acknowledging miscalculations, and accepting losses as an ordinary part of progress. Only by recognizing errors can we transcend them, ensuring that the costs incurred are not in vain.  

We must strive to avoid being unforgiving even when in the right, and instead embrace inclusivity. Many of our self-proclaimed "rational" judgments are rooted in "fatal conceit." Socialism may be a fatal conceit; so too may market economies and individualism.  

Truly great marvels often arise from those who courageously examine themselves, negate their past, renew their thinking, and press forward. Conversely, the greatest disasters in human history have been wrought by cowards and fools who cling stubbornly to outdated ideas, fear exposure of their flaws, and resent competence, refusing to admit their errors.  

Of course, as ordinary citizens, we must also reflect frequently, learn to discern truth, and support individuals and parties that engage in regular self-reflection and correction. For individuals and parties are the choices of ordinary citizens. We often disfavor those who courageously admit and correct mistakes, instead favoring those who cover up their errors. Social problems and progress are, in essence, shaped by the hands of us all.  

In practical terms, we must adhere to the principle of "small steps, rapid iteration." We should fully excavate and absorb the merits and advancements of existing systems, inherit and carry forward mechanisms validated by innumerable practices, and use this process to create necessary transitional and adaptive periods. Only through such incremental exploration can we establish new, viable mechanisms.  

"Roads to hell are often paved with good intentions," but roads paved with malice inevitably lead to hell. "Societies where the wealthy hold power are still better than worlds where only those in power can acquire wealth," but a world led by individuals with goodwill, wisdom, and a profound understanding of Adversarial Evolution would surpass both.
