# Epilogue  
Is the evolution of human division of labor from coarseness to refinement, and from simplicity to complexity, not analogous to the evolutionary processes of division of labor in socialized animals and the transition from single-celled to multi-celled organisms? This reflects the philosophical principle that the greatest truths are the simplest and that evolutionary convergence prevails. Human division of labor and cooperation will continue to deepen and strengthen along this dimensional trajectory. [Sustaining this trend, however, relies on more robust underlying mechanisms—each step forward imposes greater pressure on these foundational systems.]() At present, these underlying mechanisms are none other than the Virtue Selection Mechanism.  

For a prolonged period following the discovery of evolutionary theory, the proposal of the "selfish gene" theory, and the marginalization of group selection theory, humans deeply doubted the motivations behind cooperation and altruism. This skepticism extended to morality, human nature, and ultimately, the very meaning of life—a profoundly dangerous state of affairs. Fortunately, over time, an increasing number of individuals have identified the flaws in this perspective and, from diverse angles and disciplines, rediscovered the profound essence of humanity. I have compiled the relevant books I have studied into the reference list, which is presented here: *Sociobiology: The New Synthesis*, *The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation*, *Genesis: The Deep Origins of Society from the Cell to Civilization*, *The Meaning of Human Existence*, *SuperCooperators: Altruism, Evolution, and Why We Need Each Other*, *The Evolution of Morality*, *Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny*, *The Evolution of Human Societies: From Foraging Group to Agrarian State*, *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion*, *Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace of Life in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies*, *The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition* (note: Dawkins later expressed regret over the title "selfish"), *The Value of Human Evolution: How Cooperation Makes Us a Powerful Group*, *The Kindness of Humankind: A Countercurrent Grand History Summoning Hope in an Age of Despair*, and *Can Humans Still Cooperate Well?*  

Notably, the works of Edward O. Wilson, the pioneer of sociobiology and an expert on ants, transcend their era and have been severely underappreciated. In fact, even Dawkins himself, on the 30th anniversary of *The Selfish Gene*, expressed regret over his choice of the title "selfish." However, the "morality-virtue selection" mechanism has grown outdated—it emerged during the Stone Age, whereas human development over the past few millennia has outpaced the rate of genetic mutation. Humans now face a significant evolutionary crisis, which will be the focus of the next chapter.  

By examining the past ten thousand years of human prehistory, we aim to better navigate the next ten thousand years. As human beings, we have reason to be proud. Our past character and achievements are undeniably great—a greatness unparalleled among all known biological species and transcending the cosmic boundaries we currently perceive. Our struggles, perseverance, and kindness all deserve to be celebrated in odes and passed down through generations. While our future holds promise, our present is fraught with peril. We must pause, re-examine our history from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, and thereby rechart our course for the future.
