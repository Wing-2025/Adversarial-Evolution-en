# What Is the Secret to Human Success?  
What constitutes the fundamental distinction between humans and other organisms? What characteristic has enabled humans to achieve unprecedented accomplishments? The secret to human success has long been a hot topic in the scientific community. Now, the question we aim to address transforms into: Why has this unremarkable "third species of ape"—humans—achieved feats that all their close relatives, cousins, and distant kin cannot even approach?  

If we examine the taxonomic group of Hominini in greater detail, it can be subdivided into numerous subspecies. Among these are the more familiar *Homo erectus*, *Homo sapiens*, *Homo habilis*, and *Homo ergaster*, as well as less well-known ones like *Australopithecus*, *Paranthropus boisei*, *Paranthropus robustus*, *Homo rudolfensis*, *Homo heidelbergensis*, and *Homo neanderthalensis*. These diverse branches of the human lineage have evolved a range of traits, such as bipedal locomotion, hair loss, tool-making and tool-use, increased brain volume, control of fire and consumption of cooked food, and the evolution of language and writing. We typically analyze these seemingly distinct traits to infer the differences between humans and other organisms. Let us follow this line of reasoning to determine if we can identify the fundamental distinctions between humans and other animals, and whether these distinctions contribute to defining humanity’s critical advantages and core values.

## Bipedalism  

First, the most obvious trait that comes to mind is bipedalism. Among primates, humans are the only species with sustained bipedal locomotion. *Homo erectus* also represents a critical branch of early humans, though it is worth noting that *Homo erectus* was not the earliest human relative to adopt bipedalism.  

### Advantages of Bipedalism  

What advantages does bipedalism confer? Common arguments include: facilitating an increase in brain volume, expanding the field of vision, and freeing the hands for tool use. The idea that bipedalism facilitates increased brain volume is intuitive—quadrupedal locomotion does not provide vertical support for the brain, making it difficult for the cervical spine to bear the weight of a larger brain. Additionally, standing upright undeniably broadens the field of vision, though many quadrupedal animals can also stand briefly to gain a wider view. The argument that bipedalism frees the hands is less compelling, as primates like gorillas already have dexterous hands and use "knuckle-walking" locomotion. Some scientists propose that bipedalism improved humans’ ability to gather fruit. However, quadrupedal primates, such as gorillas, can also stand upright; moreover, quadrupedal animals generally possess better climbing abilities, which are crucial for fruit-gathering and evading predators.  

Another, more controversial hypothesis is the "energy-saving theory," which posits that bipedalism consumes less energy than quadrupedal locomotion. However, early experimental evidence compared oxygen consumption between chimpanzees and humans, which is unscientific. When comparing energy expenditure between bipedal and quadrupedal walking in chimpanzees, studies find that quadrupedalism generally uses less energy, with consumption also dependent on stride length. Later, physiologists Lewis Halsey of the University of Roehampton (UK) and Craig White of the University of Queensland (Australia) compared the energetic efficiency of human movement with that of over 80 mammalian species, including monkeys, rodents, horses, bears, and elephants. They found that for a typical animal weighing approximately 140 pounds (the average human weight), the net energy cost of running is about 10.03 milliliters of oxygen per meter, whereas humans exhibit a significantly higher value of 12.77 milliliters per meter—27% above the average. Halsey and White noted that while modern humans and *Australopithecus afarensis* have higher walking efficiency than other mammals of similar size, neither is exceptional. When considering all mammalian data, both modern humans and *Australopithecus afarensis* fall within the 95% prediction interval. Their conclusion: human bipedalism is not energetically unique.  

### Disadvantages of Bipedalism  

However, modern science has identified numerous disadvantages of bipedalism: reduced sprint speed and ability to evade predators, increased strain on the heart, susceptibility to visceral prolapse, bone damage, osteophyte formation, intervertebral disc herniation, and varicose veins. Each of these disadvantages could, in theory, place humans at a disadvantage in the harsh process of natural selection. Many believe bipedalism played a pivotal role in human evolution—can we thus regard it as the fundamental distinction between humans and animals? The ancient Greek philosopher Plato might agree, as he defined humans as "featherless, bipedal creatures." Diogenes the Cynic, a member of the Cynic school, plucked a chicken and displayed it at the entrance of Plato’s Academy, declaring, "This is Plato’s human!" In reality, many animals have evolved bipedalism, such as the well-known *Tyrannosaurus rex*. Most primates can switch between quadrupedal (knuckle-walking) and bipedal locomotion; their failure to evolve permanent bipedalism likely stems from the retained advantages of quadrupedalism. Moreover, many primates can use tools with their forelimbs. We will analyze brain-related advantages separately later. In summary, bipedalism is not particularly rare in the animal kingdom—[sustained bipedalism appears to be a strategy abandoned by most species](). Thus, it cannot serve as the dividing line between humans and other animals.  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a886ea1-55b0-4249-861f-405f824edf02" />

## Hair Loss  

Earlier, we noted that Plato defined humans by two traits: bipedalism and hairlessness. What function does hair loss serve? Several hypotheses exist regarding the causes of human hair loss:  

1. **Sexual Selection Theory**: Some argue that individuals with shorter hair were more competitive in mate selection, leading to the gradual loss of body hair. However, this merely shifts the question—we must explain why genes favoring mates with more hair were eliminated. If dense hair were beneficial for survival, such genes would presumably persist or even increase.  

2. **Aquatic Ape Hypothesis**: This theory posits that human ancestors were aquatic, and hair loss improved their ability to survive in water. I find this unconvincing: humans lack key evolutionary traits of aquatic organisms, and even if there were an aquatic phase, why did hair not re-evolve after humans transitioned to a primarily terrestrial lifestyle? Many primitive genetic traits are retained, and atavism (the reappearance of ancestral traits) is not uncommon.  

3. **Parasite Theory**: This suggests that dense body hair provided a habitat for parasites, which compromised health. Humans with less hair thus enjoyed better survival. Indeed, the divergence time of parasites can help estimate when human hair loss occurred. Early humans hosted only one type of louse, as their body hair was continuous. As hair thinned, hair was reduced to the scalp and pubic regions—environments distinct enough to lead to the divergence of two louse species. Using genetic sequences of these lice and the molecular clock principle, scientists estimate that human hair loss occurred approximately 1.2 million years ago.  

While the parasite theory has merit, the most widely accepted explanation is the **Heat Dissipation Theory**. This holds that after humans developed hunting, they relied on endurance running to exhaust prey. Prolonged running generates significant body heat, and excessive hair would impede heat dissipation, driving the evolution of hair loss. Early humans originated in Africa, where hairlessness posed no cold risk. Later, the invention of skills like skinning animals and making clothing allowed humans to inhabit colder regions without re-evolving body hair.  

Can hair loss be considered the fundamental distinction between humans and other animals? Clearly not, as many aquatic mammals also exhibit hair loss. More importantly, hair loss is a relatively simple evolutionary change, requiring only minor genetic mutations to suppress certain phenotypic traits. If it were truly critical, most animals would have evolved "human-like" hairlessness. Thus, hair loss cannot serve as the fundamental distinction between humans and other animals.  

## The Use of Fire

Archaeological discoveries have confirmed that Homo erectus began using fire, and the latest research suggests that the history of human fire use may date back 1.7 million years. At prehistoric human sites worldwide, evidence of fuel used for fire—including various types of wood, peat, turf, animal dung, seaweed, and straw—has been uncovered. Even today, many ethnic groups retain the practice of fire deity worship; in ancient Chinese legends, there is the story of Suiren, who created fire by drilling wood. In Greek mythology, Prometheus is the figure associated with fire, said to have stolen fire from the gods and bestowed it upon humanity. With fire, early humans could transport sparks from lightning strikes to other camps, endowing our ancestors with immense survival advantages across multiple domains. Fire could be used to startle and corral animals; it provided warmth; and it enabled cooking, transforming raw food into cooked meals. Cooked food significantly reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses, simplified chewing and digestion, saved time, facilitated nutrient absorption, alleviated the burden on the digestive tract, and laid a solid foundation for brain evolution. Undoubtedly, mastering fire was a landmark advancement for humanity. However, some animals also use fire—certain monkeys and birds, for instance. Why, then, has fire not been widely adopted by animals? This question is intrinsically linked to the true reason for humanity’s rise, which I will explain later. For now, let us set this aside. Furthermore, while fire brought numerous benefits to humans, its core advantage was supporting brain evolution. If our subsequent discussion concludes that the brain is not the fundamental distinction between humans and animals, would you still regard fire use as that defining difference?  

### Tool Making and Use?  
At one point, "the ability to use tools" was a textbook standard for distinguishing humans from animals—a notion deeply ingrained in public understanding. However, over recent decades, it has been increasingly observed that many animals also use tools. A brief summary of such cases follows:  

1. Elephants sometimes use branches held by their trunks to scratch themselves or swat away insects.  
2. Monkeys use sharp sticks as spears and exhibit rudimentary stone-using abilities.  
   <p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ee8aec3-d8d5-4853-93fa-120e48aeeeb0" /></p>  
3. Chimpanzees possess an especially diverse toolkit: they use stones to crack nuts, leaves to fish for termites, twigs to extract honey, and even fashion leaves into sponges to absorb water. With training, they can also start fires and cook.  
   <p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5eb8831-054a-4cb2-be65-c2870ffedafb" /><img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a56d15-119f-4ce1-b1c2-80e86762afdb" /></p>  
4. Wild gorillas use branches to measure water depth and as walking sticks to cross rivers.  
5. Orangutans use leaves to whistle, scaring away predators.  
6. Boxer crabs wield stinging anemones as defensive weapons.  
7. American alligators place sticks on their snouts to lure egrets, which require sticks for nesting.  
8. Madagascar parrots use pebbles to grind shells into calcium powder, creating nutritional supplements for themselves.  
9. Egyptian vultures use stones to crack ostrich eggs. Young vultures, unable to carry large stones, use small rocks, wood, or feces to strike eggs instead.  
10. New Caledonian crows use spiked twigs to catch insects.  
11. Parrots often use tools to scratch themselves.  
12. Octopuses use coconut shells as armor and mobile shelters. Veined octopuses stack discarded human coconut shells like bowls and carry them.  
13. Some crows use passing cars to crush walnuts, allowing them to access a food source other animals struggle to obtain.  
14. Dolphins not only use tools but also learn tool-using techniques from their mothers. For example, they use mucus from gorgonian coral for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial purposes, and employ conch shells as traps to catch fish.  
    <p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4157ecaf-0a7b-4716-bf6b-01501d41df3c" /></p>  
15. Recent discoveries reveal that even small-brained fish use tools: Many are familiar with the BBC documentary footage of tuskfish using coral to crack clams. This behavior demonstrates not only fish’s tool use but also their ability to remember tool positions, methods of use, and other complex logic.  
    <p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7187058-98e9-4327-861e-fb1c50163789" /></p>  
16. Termites, as highly successful social insects, use formic acid to dissolve various natural materials—including gold and silver ores—to concentrate metals in their jaws and mouthparts, enhancing their physical strength. Most termites, however, can only access zinc, magnesium, and manganese for this purpose. Additionally, "cultivating" fungus gardens is a termite specialty, a process analogous to human agriculture (e.g., rice farming). This represents an advanced form of "tool" use: domesticating other species for one’s benefit.  
    <p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eebec7bf-1d4a-4c2e-8d33-a80301a4f61a" /></p>  

Given these examples, it is difficult to uphold tool use as the fundamental distinction between humans and animals. Some may argue that redefining the criterion as "tool creation" instead of "tool use" would resolve this. Yet this proposition is problematic. It is akin to claiming that only animals capable of building rockets and landing on the moon qualify as human. Where lies the boundary between "creation" and "use"? If "creation" requires deep understanding of a tool’s physical principles and derivation, this standard is excessively high—one that most ancient and modern humans would fail to meet, leaving few true "humans" by this measure. If the standard for "creation" is lowered, animals also appear capable of such acts. **Thus, neither "tool use" nor "tool creation" adequately serves as the fundamental distinction between humans and animals.**  

### The Advanced Brain  
Unsurprisingly, our next topic is the human brain. The complexity of the human brain is indeed rare in the biological world. This marvel of evolution enables us to compose poetry, master astronomy and geography, and excel in mathematics and physics—truly one of the most intricate entities in the cosmos. Is this brain, which humanity so proudly claims, the essential distinction from other species?  

#### The Advantages of the Brain  
The benefits of an advanced brain are self-evident and deeply felt. In the complex division of labor in human society, intellectual capacity plays a critical role everywhere: from agricultural and animal husbandry techniques to cooking methods and tools; from clothing production to architectural skills; from cars, high-speed trains, and airplanes to rockets—our daily lives depend on brainpower. This has propelled human civilization to heights unattainable by animal intelligence. In individual lives, intelligence is also a key factor in success, influencing academic performance, career achievement, and even mate selection. It is hard to imagine a person with intellectual disabilities achieving greater social success than a brilliant individual. Indeed, the eugenicists mentioned in Chapter 1 sought to use intelligence to rank human races as superior or inferior. Some also argue that the brain first provided humans with adaptive advantages, suggesting that its early development may have been driven by glacial periods recurring every 100,000 years, requiring humans to adapt cognitively to changing environments. **Thus, it is easy to assume that the advanced brain significantly enhances biological fitness in the broad sense, leading people to conclude that it is the fundamental distinction between humans and animals.**  

However, the issue is far more complex. If the brain so effectively and permanently enhances fitness, why have most species not evolved similarly large brain sizes and complex structures? Some might immediately retort that brain evolution is too difficult, and humans were merely fortunate to achieve it, making it our unique trait. Is this true? Let us examine the mechanisms of brain size evolution.  

We know that the brain began to form as early as 521 million years ago, in the earliest vertebrates—jawless fish-like creatures known as *Haikouichthys* and *Myllokunmingia*—discovered in the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota of China. 521 million years is ample time for biological evolution; countless species have emerged, thrived, and perished in this span. If the brain were truly so critical and effective, it should have evolved repeatedly, like eyes or wings. Yet humanity’s large, complex brain and high intelligence are nearly unique in the biological world.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c51afddf-942b-4731-8121-b4e81d3fe394" /></p>  
**In reality, most species have evolved brains of moderate size, as if they approach this "important" organ with restraint and a佛系 (detached) attitude.**  

### What Controls Brain Size?  
*The Evolving Brain* notes that genes serve as the "blueprint" for the human brain. For example, studies of microcephaly have identified genetic mutations associated with this condition.

One gene we currently understand best is ASPM. The protein encoded by the ASPM gene is involved in cell division; specifically, it aids cells in forming the mitotic spindle, which is critical for ensuring that newly generated daughter cells receive the appropriate normal chromosomal sets. A key segment of this protein can bind to the signaling molecule calmodulin. The coding sequence for the calmodulin-binding domain in the ASPM gene of *C. elegans* (roundworms) has 2 copies, that of *Drosophila* (fruit flies) has 24 copies, and that of humans has 74 copies. Furthermore, through point-to-point comparative analysis of the ASPM genes in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus macaques, researchers have found that the evolution of the ASPM gene—particularly its calmodulin-binding domain—accelerated specifically during the hominoid period. The greatest degree of divergence in the ASPM gene is observed during the evolutionary transition from hominoids to humans. Thus, ASPM and similar genes likely played significant roles in the evolutionary expansion of human brain volume.  

Further research has identified a gene lost in humans that still regulates brain size in chimpanzees. This gene is located adjacent to a tumor suppressor gene and modulates its activity. Tumor suppressor genes, which inhibit cancer development, effectively control cell division and growth; if inactivated, cell division becomes unregulated. [It is highly probable that the loss of this gene altered the activity of the tumor suppressor gene, accelerating the proliferation of human brain neurons and thereby rapidly enhancing intelligence.]() Recent studies have shown that human neural progenitor cells mature in approximately 7 days, while those of chimpanzees mature in about 5 days. The maturation of neural progenitor cells is closely linked to the *ZEB2* gene: delaying *ZEB2* activation in chimpanzee brain organoids results in brain development resembling that of humans, and conversely, prematurely activating *ZEB2* in human brain organoids leads to development akin to chimpanzee brains. This research was published in the *Cell* journal, with corresponding author Madeline A. Lancaster, a leading molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8576542e-5c1a-4580-b3da-974f93eb112c" />
</p>  

Professor Lancaster noted, "Human brain volume is three times that of chimpanzees, yet merely delaying the morphological changes (maturation) of neural progenitor cells in the early stages of brain development is sufficient to profoundly impact brain development and erase the differences between human and chimpanzee brains. This is truly astonishing."  

In another recent paper, scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany further revealed that a single amino acid difference in a key protein distinguishes modern humans from Neanderthals, endowing modern humans with brains containing more neurons and enhanced cognitive abilities. This critical protein is transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1). Genomic comparisons have shown that few proteins differ in amino acid sequence between modern humans and Neanderthals, and TKTL1 is one such example. Almost all modern humans possess a TKTL1 variant with an arginine (Arg) at a specific amino acid position, whereas Neanderthals have a lysine (Lys) at the same site.  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c405b47-d179-482a-a130-35c57accf29f" />
</p>  

From these observations, we arrive at a conclusion: for most species, *inhibiting brain development—rather than unleashing its potential—is a necessary step, likely a product of natural selection.* Additionally, two studies published consecutively in *Science* in February 2025 provided compelling evidence that the advanced cognitive abilities of birds and mammals did not originate from a common ancestor but evolved independently. This convergence suggests that the acquisition of intelligence is not excessively difficult; similar outcomes have been achieved across species using distinct biological "materials" and "processes."  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d4c737c-fcc7-429a-a28c-a2cff0d46f2b" /></p>  

### How to Increase Brain Volume?  

Notably, the mechanisms by which humans achieved brain volume expansion and development appear surprisingly straightforward. [*Neoteny*—the retention of juvenile traits into adulthood—is a unique phenomenon in human evolution.]() Compared to our close non-human primate relatives, humans exhibit slower developmental rates and delayed maturation. The evolutionary significance of human neoteny lies in providing an extended time window for brain development and the plasticity of neural networks, a key factor in the formation of human intelligence. Most human traits, except sexual maturity, develop slowly. Consequently, adult humans have flatter faces and relatively less body hair—traits observed in juvenile chimpanzees but lost as they age, developing protruding snouts and increased body hair. Critically, modern humans maintain the brain growth rate typical of juvenile chimpanzees *but sustain this rate for a longer period.* This results in larger brains and the prolongation of rapid learning capacities characteristic of childhood. Thus, early precocity warrants less pride; late blooming aligns more closely with human growth patterns. Strikingly, the human brain rarely ceases development entirely: even in adults over 20, new neurons and neural connections continue to form with sustained mental activity, and diverse stimuli can induce distinct patterns of brain growth. From this perspective, we infer that mutations in genes regulating the duration of neoteny could potentially lead to larger brains. In summary, [sustained brain development is not an arduous evolutionary process; inhibiting brain development, however, requires additional mechanisms.]() [Why, then, has nature selected to suppress the remarkable potential of such sophisticated brains in most animals?]()  

### The Disadvantages of a Large Brain  

#### The High Cost of Brain Function  

The core issue lies in the exorbitant cost of maintaining brain function. The average power density of the human brain is 15 W/kg, whereas that of the body is only 2 W/kg. As described by American neuroscientists Pierre Magistretti, Luc Pellerin, and Jean-Luc Martin: although the brain constitutes just 2% of body weight, it receives 15% of cardiac output, consumes 20% of total oxygen, and utilizes 25% of total glucose. The mean blood flow to the human brain is 57 mL/100g/min, with the brain extracting approximately 50% of oxygen and 10% of glucose from arterial blood. Additionally, giving birth to large-headed infants is difficult and dangerous, particularly for bipedal species, as upright walking necessitates a narrow pelvis rather than a broad one. In short, brain expansion is an extremely risky and costly investment.  

#### The Sacrifice of the Intestine  

A fascinating observation is that as human brain size increased and complexity grew, the intestine shrank. For comparison, early humans had relatively larger pelves, while modern humans have much shorter intestines than chimpanzees (which have broad pelves). The intestine’s power density is actually higher than the brain’s, as digesting food requires significant energy. According to Aiello and Wheeler’s research, the brain’s power density is 11.2 W/kg, while the intestine’s is 12.2 W/kg. Notably, the expansion of brain size and reduction of intestinal size in humans occurred concurrently. Clearly, increased brain energy consumption was compensated by reduced visceral energy expenditure. Consequently, human diets shifted: early humans could no longer subsist on low-energy, bulk foods like grass, which would require long, energy-intensive intestines. Instead, humans began consuming higher-quality, easily digestible foods such as animal proteins, seeds, nuts, and berries. Access to such high-quality food was foundational to brain size expansion.  

Guppies (small, colorful fish) were chosen as experimental subjects to test the relationship between brain and organ size ratios. Beyond their ornamental value, guppies were selected because they possess basic mathematical abilities, serving as a proxy for intelligence. Unlike most fish, guppies are viviparous (giving birth to live young), allowing precise counting of offspring, which simplifies the measurement of reproductive efficiency. Researchers used artificial selection to breed guppies with larger brains and observed that as brain size increased, intestinal size decreased—with the reduction ratio far exceeding the increase in brain size—indicating that brain expansion is twice as costly as intestinal growth. This had severe consequences: while these guppies sometimes displayed greater intelligence, reduced intestinal absorption led to inadequate nutrition and significantly fewer offspring. This trade-off, a classic case of diminishing returns, also constrains humans. Many animals, particularly herbivores, have highly convoluted intestines. Humans, however, have shorter intestines—a cost of brain expansion—mitigated by our ability to consume refined, easily digestible foods, which provide richer nutrition and reduce dependence on intestines compared to animals like cows and horses. It now appears that many animals face a balance between nutrition and intelligence; only humans have managed to offset losses, deriving far greater benefits from brain expansion than costs.  

#### Loss of Bite Force

Some researchers have also noted that for apes to evolve larger brains, their jaws need to weaken. This is because jaw muscles pass through the top of the skull (particularly in gorillas), and increasing brain capacity requires reducing biting force. Biting force is also a critical survival trait, as we belong to Gnathostomata, an ancient clade defined by this characteristic.  

### Every Human Being Is a Premature Infant  
The issue of brain enlargement involves multiple dimensions. Archaeologists have discovered that the gestation period of human ancestors was 12 months, not 9. Why did human infants later start being born three months earlier? Because fetal heads grew too large, mothers had to deliver them prematurely to reduce the risks of childbirth. Even so, human childbirth remains far more difficult than that of most other animals. Even human male aesthetic preferences have been shaped to adapt to the expanding demands of the human brain. This is quite abnormal in the biological world—[given the critical importance of reproduction to a species’ genetic survival, it should be a remarkably easy process. Individuals for whom reproduction becomes problematic are easily eliminated by natural selection. Yet the human brain has managed to grow "savagely" despite such pressures.]( )  

Nearly all other mammals can stand, feed independently, and sleep on their own within hours or days of birth. Only human infants take at least three months after birth to learn to roll over or sleep unassisted. For each newborn, those three missing months of gestation are incredibly challenging. It is not an overstatement to say that [an excessively large brain is, in a sense, a "progressive evolutionary disorder" of humans.]( ) Rarely do animals face such difficult childbirth, bear such immense risks, or produce offspring as vulnerable as human infants.  

On the other hand, the growth period of prematurely born human infants is also unusually long compared to other animals. Most animals can forage and fend for themselves shortly after birth. Humans, however, combine premature birth with the aforementioned neoteny—a suite of mechanisms designed specifically for brain development—resulting in a growth period far longer than that of most animals. This is a perilous adaptation, as it places enormous stress on human parents, exacerbating the burdens of life in an already resource-scarce and dangerous primitive environment.  

### Wallace’s Conundrum  
[Can the enhanced fitness provided by the human brain truly offset the costs of its "savage growth"?]( ) In fact, Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer of the theory of evolution, harbored similar doubts. Wallace believed that humans’ excess intelligence served little purpose in competition—for example, musical and mathematical abilities. Especially in primitive societies, he saw no reason why individuals with such talents would fare better. A staunch Darwinian (even more so than Darwin himself), Wallace held that natural selection was supremely decisive. He emphasized that if a trait appeared maladaptive, it must be an illusion born of our ignorance; no organism has truly "useless" organs—we only perceive them as such due to our lack of understanding!  

Though Wallace believed evolution and natural selection could explain humanity’s physical form, he struggled to account for our intellectual achievements. He argued that natural selection alone could not construct a "magnificent spiritual edifice." Wallace reasoned that gorillas’ brains are already sufficient to meet natural selection’s demands. If natural selection continued to act, it might slightly expand the human brain—but human brains are one and a half times larger than gorillas’. Purely natural selection could not produce such an oversized organ. For mere survival, such a brain is unnecessary—wasteful, even—and natural selection would never indulge such a "frivolous" demand. It could provide a brain slightly larger than a gorilla’s, but not one fit for philosophy.  

Wallace’s doubts are well-founded. Evolution generally avoids abrupt changes. If large brains were truly so useful and cost-effective for individuals, the entire primate order—indeed, all mammals—would have evolved larger brain capacities. Mammals have been evolving for nearly 200 million years, and primates for tens of millions. It would not have fallen to humans alone to "specialize" in this trait.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bae09049-87cb-43d8-a282-4e599442d614" /></p>  

Unable to find a satisfactory evolutionary rationale for human intelligence and brain size, Wallace eventually embraced spiritualism. He believed a supernatural force must have endowed humans with the capacity for thought and soul, a unique ability possessed only by our species. [Indeed, this is a question we cannot evade—what purpose does human brain enlargement serve? We have evolved mechanisms to support larger brains, but what tangible benefits does this enlargement provide?]( )  

Some might argue that the brain enables toolmaking. But could a primitive human with tools defeat apex predators like lions or leopards? Early Paleolithic tools were far too crude for that. Others might claim the brain supports strategic planning. Could a primitive human outsmart a lion with strategy alone? Clearly not. These are precisely the questions that troubled Wallace. Conversely, if brain size conferred such overwhelming survival advantages and were easy to evolve, this ancient organ would have expanded dramatically eons ago. Even if we acknowledge the brain’s benefits—knowledge acquisition, cultural transmission, logical reasoning, tool invention, navigation, hunting strategies—[from the perspective of natural selection, particularly for individuals]( ), the drawbacks of a larger brain must outweigh its advantages. After all, most mammals exhibit remarkably conservative brain growth.  

Thus, we must explain why gorillas and other species are constrained by the low cost-effectiveness of brain development, while humans have developed brains three times larger. At this point, I believe we must reconsider: Can the human brain, this trait we so pride ourselves on, truly be called the fundamental distinction between humans and animals? Are human achievements fundamentally rooted in the brain?  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba82655-a5a9-413f-8dcb-7a1e1a595d8b" /></p>  

[From the foregoing discussion, we can conclude at least two points: A developed brain is not inherently difficult to evolve. Most animals have not evolved large brains because the cost-effectiveness is low. Given sufficient evolutionary pressure, brain capacity would expand readily. The fact that it does not suggests that the brain’s role in species survival is less significant than the benefits it provides.]( ) Strictly speaking, humans do not have the largest brains—larger animals, like whales (with brains weighing ~9 kg, compared to ~1.5 kg in humans), have larger ones. Even in terms of brain-to-body mass ratio, humans are not the record holders: ants have a 1:7 ratio, tree shrews 1:10, humans 1:40, and dolphins 1:78. A counterexample: Neanderthals had slightly larger brains than modern humans, with more robust muscles and better vision, yet they vanished from history. Evidence suggests their lives were harsh, and they achieved no remarkable hunting feats compared to their Cro-Magnon (modern human) relatives. If the brain is not humanity’s "secret to success," what else could it be?  

## The Evolution of Language  
Next, consider language. Complex language is almost certainly humanity’s unique weapon, and its impact is profound. To gauge its importance, imagine a day without speech—how frustrating it would be, how inefficient our work (even accounting for typing or messaging, which are forms of language). We would barely function. But can language be considered the fundamental human-animal distinction? Let us first ask: [If animals acquired language, would they derive immense benefits? Could they then evolve civilizations on par with humanity’s?]( )  

Take tigers. If they developed language, they could communicate with one another—but tigers are rivals and solitary; "two tigers cannot share a mountain." Language would be useless to them. Consider gazelles, which migrate in herds. If they gained language, they could alert one another to predators. But in reality, their current level of cooperation requires only a loud call or an elegant leap—no need for advanced language. [This raises a question: Why is "language," so critical to humans, such a "useless luxury" for other animals?]( ) I would even argue that if language provided the slightest survival benefit to animals, many species would have evolved it.

To date, the most complex non-human language system discovered exists among a highly cooperative animal species: the marmot (commonly known as the groundhog, scientific name *Marmota*), a rodent. Scientists have found that marmot vocalizations constitute the most intricate non-human language observed thus far. They can convey detailed information about predators, including species, size, and appearance; they can even alert their peers to the color of clothing humans wear and whether humans are armed with guns. All this complex linguistic information is communicated through chirps lasting less than one second.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73c05ac6-3162-4703-810b-54faaf4cce18" />  
</p>  

Similarly, dolphins possess language capabilities to communicate with one another, and apes use a simple language system. Species with relatively advanced communication abilities are almost all highly cooperative species in the biological world. From a purely vocal perspective, evolving language is not inherently difficult. Parrots, for instance, leave a deep impression with their ability to mimic sounds, including "repeating" human words and conversations. The Guinness World Records feature a parrot named "Prudle" that mastered 800 words. I believe that any animal could evolve "language" capabilities if it confers a fitness advantage. However, most animals’ rudimentary language abilities merely align with the cooperative levels they have already developed. For most species, informing companions of food sources or the location of predators offers no personal benefit—this would only lead to food being consumed by peers or predators growing more aggressive from hunger, thereby increasing one’s own risk. For them, the evolution of language might even be more detrimental than beneficial. Thus, I do not consider language the fundamental reason for humanity’s extraordinary success. Through the above - mentioned detailed analysis, though, we are beginning to approach the truth: humanity’s success is related to all these traits, yet none is the most critical. [We seem to glimpse an invisible force propelling humans along an evolutionary path that is easily attainable (requiring minimal evolutionary distance) but fraught with flaws and fitness costs. This underlying mechanism, this invisible force, may well be the true root cause of human origins we seek.]  

## What Fundamental Trait Distinguishes Humans from Animals?  

What propelled humans onto such a uniquely evolutionary trajectory? Bipedalism, a developed brain, tool - making, and an advanced language system. From the perspective of individual adaptation, each step along this path appears futile or even burdensome. Whether bipedal locomotion, increased brain size, or language ability, within the Hobbesian Jungle State of individual competition, these traits are almost universally more detrimental than beneficial—explaining why countless other species have abandoned them. [Even the crafting of more complex tools, in my view, is an evolutionary path rejected by other animals.] Tools, as external objects, demand significant energy and effort to create and maintain, yet they are easily stolen or seized by conspecifics, rendering the endeavor unprofitable. Simple tool - making or the use of现成 tools (readily available tools) occurs in many animals, but most species remain limited to rudimentary tool use. Humankind, however, has completely rewritten the rules of the game, transforming these same physiological mechanisms from maladaptive to adaptive. How did humans rewrite nature’s "rules"? (Note: The viewpoints in this chapter are derived from the author’s factual reasoning and have not undergone rigorous academic verification.)  

### Re - examining Brain Evolution  

Let us revisit the evolutionary drivers of the human brain. As previously noted, investing in brain development is a losing proposition for most species, which thus tend to evolve genes that limit brain growth. Is there a state, a precondition, that could make increased brain size an "advantage"—a more cost - effective choice? Indeed, such a state exists: *more intensive cooperative relationships than any other species*.  

In the first volume of this book, we discussed that labor division represents an advanced form of cooperation. Only under the premise of labor division does a developed brain become useful; intellectual laborers can then occupy a role in the division of labor, and their value is realized. Without labor division, if every individual must handle foraging, hunting, child - rearing, and sentry duties alone, a developed brain would not enhance their fitness. Scientists, philosophers, and artists would be even more prone to perishing from hunger and cold, as their energy - intensive brains would not survive long enough to produce inventions—even if such inventions materialized, low cooperation levels would negate any economies of scale, leaving their creations with minimal impact on individual life. Consider Archimedes’ brilliant mathematical mind, which would have been useless outside large - scale military conflicts, or Newton’s laws of physics, which would hold no value in a low - cooperation society. [Only within a highly cooperative, meticulously divided society does human intelligence find purpose. Only then does the evolutionary precondition for increased brain size emerge—where brain expansion truly enhances humanity’s broad - sense fitness.] [The human brain is a product of ascension in cooperative capacity.]  

However, labor division emerged relatively recently in human history; it was not the initial driver of brain size evolution. An earlier impetus was required. Otherwise, social superorganisms like bees and ants, which also exhibit high cooperation, would have evolved similarly developed brains. What, then, first induced brain development and expansion? It cannot be that increased brain size directly enhances individual fitness; otherwise, large - brained organisms would be far more common in nature. The brain’s earliest purpose likely served a unique, perhaps human - specific "mechanism."  

As discussed in previous chapters, the most primitive evolutionary driver of the brain was probably the "Tit - for - Tat Mechanism" of reciprocity (a mechanism widespread among mammals and possibly the cause of mammalian prosperity). Tit - for - Tat requires individual (facial) recognition and memory of "grudges" and "favors." [For humans, brain evolution would further be driven by the needs of "Virtue Selection" (Virtue - Upholding and Evil - Rejectionism).] This demands a larger brain: unlike Tit - for - Tat, which only requires remembering how others treat oneself, Virtue Selection necessitates remembering how individuals treat other group members to comprehensively assess their virtue or vice. Moral judgment, a relatively complex cognitive act, imposes higher demands on brain development. Larger brains support more extensive Virtue Selection mechanisms, which are prerequisites for high - level cooperation.  

Scientists have observed a key phenomenon: the most famous is Dunbar’s number. Evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar studied average group sizes among primates like monkeys and chimpanzees. For primates and carnivores—the two most intelligent terrestrial taxa—brain size correlates closely with social capacity. The larger a species’ social group, the greater the proportion of the neocortex relative to other brain regions. We can even predict social group size using neocortex ratio, even when group size is unknown. By this logic, the human social group size is approximately 150 individuals. This estimate aligns with reality: typical hunter - gatherer tribes, religious groups, personal contact lists, and military companies all number around 150. This figure also represents the size of an average person’s effective social circle—thus, the renowned "Dunbar’s 150."  

Another indirect piece of evidence involves the species I consider most analogous to humans: killer whales. By "analogous," I do not mean genetically; rather, I refer to their civilizational achievements and the mechanisms underlying their success. Humans dominate land, while killer whales are undisputed oceanic hegemons. This highly social species has one of the largest brain - to - body mass ratios in the animal kingdom, second only to humans—a point we will revisit later.  

Thus, the intrinsic demand for rapid human brain evolution likely stems from the need to identify and remember "virtuous" and "vicious" individuals. Through "Virtue Selection," this shapes human cooperative capacity—specifically, humanity’s unique moral behavior—leading to high - level cooperation and unprecedented cooperative dividends. Humans may be the most gossiping, meddlesome, and neighborhood - chattering animals in the biological world. It is hard to imagine how such behavior aids survival: the brain is an energy - intensive organ, and the direct benefits of such irrelevant activities are negligible. Without the highly divided labor, cooperative social production, and collective defense mechanisms supported by Virtue Selection, even the most intelligent brain would have limited utility. Imagine placing a modern human—whether a biologist, physicist, top hacker, or polymath—into a primeval forest, isolated from society and companions. Without modern tools, they would likely perish within three days (even the *Robinson Crusoe* myth relies heavily on tools from civilized society). A mouse or rabbit would outlive them. In fact, among primates, the more encephalized apes (chimpanzees) "fare poorly" and are now endangered.

As we have previously mentioned, the development of the human brain comes at the cost of intestinal shortening. With a shorter intestine, humans needed to compete for food with higher nutritional and energy density—animal protein—to obtain equivalent levels of nourishment and energy. In the animal kingdom, there exists a delicate balance: while top predators can directly consume the most energy-rich animal protein, they expend enormous energy on hunting, which has a low success rate. Herbivores, on the other hand, subsist on plants, expending significant energy on digestion while obtaining limited direct energy, leaving them without the physical strength or musculature to hunt prey. Humans, however, chose a different path: they evolved more powerful brains to implement the Virtue Selection strategy, ensuring that there were as few grabbing individuals as possible within the group, thereby forming a highly cooperative community.  

This approach had two key advantages: first, it reduced the need to expend all energy on solo hunting, as cooperative hunting—especially for large prey—was more cost-effective than individual efforts; second, it allowed humans to access nutrient- and energy-dense animal protein. Through this ingenious adaptation, humans secured the additional resources required to fuel brain function. Ultimately, we realize that among the many benefits conferred by the brain, it is *group cooperation*—more precisely, the "Virtue Selection mechanism" of human society and the tighter, more efficient cooperative state it fosters—that provided the brain with a novel evolutionary rationale. We have reason to argue that the Virtue Selection mechanism created the brain, rather than the reverse. Moreover, the deep cooperative mechanisms established by Virtue Selection further nurtured specialized intellectual activities and tool production, paving the way for the explosive development of the Stone Age revolution, as well as the scientific and industrial revolutions—unfolding the most brilliant new chapter in the history of life.  

At this point, we can summarize the evolutionary trajectory of the brain’s role:  
<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb99e363-dc58-451d-a821-546f619f5ff5" /></p>  

Earlier, we noted that human brain genes are strikingly similar to those of gorillas, differing only in mutations at key loci. People often express surprise at these findings, a reaction rooted in the ingrained assumption that life evolves toward increasing adaptation to nature. Many believe that a developed brain enhances human natural fitness, and even posit that primates and other mammals failed to evolve such large, complex brains because human brains are "difficult" to evolve. In reality, the critical driver of rapid brain evolution was not individual adaptation to the environment, but the importance of recognizing conspecifics and discerning Virtue and Evil for human dimensional ascension. The evolutionary challenge lies not in specific traits—over millions of years and across large populations, environmentally adaptive traits can emerge—but in nurturing the "adversarial evolutionary environment" that enables these traits. For the brain, the Virtue Selection mechanism is precisely such a challenging "environment" to evolve. It requires entire populations to transcend the Altruism Paradox and sustain traits that are disadvantageous to individual fitness (a "miracle" of evolution).  

Ayn Rand wrote in *Atlas Shrugged*, "Thinking is man’s only fundamental virtue; all others depend on it." This logic is shared by many free-market proponents, including Hayek. Yet we now understand that *the moral outlook of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, and the Virtue Selection mechanism*, are humanity’s only fundamental virtues—from which all else, including the brain, thought, language, and writing, derive. Biologist George Williams once stated, "Natural selection is a wicked process, forging extreme self-interest at the cost of immense suffering and death." However, by understanding the life principles of cooperative dividends, group selection, and hierarchical adversarial evolution, we see that the entire living world strives relentlessly toward cooperation. The brain, language, science, and wisdom are but byproducts of this grand process.  

If one day we encounter another planet dominated by intelligent beings, they likely passed through the Virtue Selection mechanism in their evolutionary journey. If they perished, it was probably due to population explosion, hypocrisy-induced cancerization, and the breakdown of Virtue Selection. Otherwise, their dominators might be creatures like dinosaurs (which maximize individual capabilities) or ants/bees (which rely on superorganismal mechanisms), but such beings are unlikely to evolve complex brains, high intelligence, or civilization—for they have no need to "discern right from wrong" or "judge Virtue and Evil."  

### Reassessing Bipedalism  

Many animals can adopt an upright posture, particularly social species. Uprightness facilitates cooperation and information sharing, such as mutual vigilance against predators—far safer than solitary living. Language likely originated in this context: for example, prairie dogs use distinct calls to signal threats from the sky (raptors), ground (snakes), or wolves. Upright posture provides a better foundation for verbal and nonverbal communication.  

For humans, bipedalism held even greater significance. With higher levels of group cooperation than other animals, uprightness increased opportunities for interaction—whether through gestures or proto-language. Standing upright made it easier to observe others’ eye movements, lip shapes, and gestures, drastically lowering the threshold for human cooperation. This rapid, responsive coordination was critical during hunting, enabling prehistoric humans to communicate while running and collaborating—an essential mode of tight teamwork.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a4bbb1f-7181-43d1-8a05-8c2b7552d30d" />  
</p>  
<p align="center">Prehistoric murals</p>  

Accompanying bipedalism was the evolution of the human sclera (the "white of the eye"). Most animals have dark sclerae, which help conceal their gaze. Humans, however, have large, pale sclerae, making their "windows to the soul"—eye movements—readily observable. This trait was undoubtedly driven by evolutionary pressures to enhance cooperative communication among individuals.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb005f19-ab06-45bd-9cb0-da5e5ad56dfc" /><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e19e126-d55f-4e59-8aa0-308f28168f26" />  
</p>  

More importantly, bipedalism is a critical foundation for the implementation of the Virtue Selection mechanism. *Upright posture increases opportunities to observe peers’ behaviors*—monitoring the actions of different individuals—without which accurate judgments of Virtue and Evil would be impossible. Unlike the Tit-for-Tat mechanism, which focuses on reciprocating individual interactions, Virtue Selection requires attention to how each individual treats others and the group as a whole. Maintaining an upright posture to continuously observe peers thus becomes essential.  

Additionally, executing Virtue Selection—rewarding Virtue and punishing Evil—relies on uprightness. Only by standing can we quickly assist the virtuous against the wicked or punish wrongdoing in the moment. *Bipedalism plays a pivotal role in the formation of Virtue Selection*. Of course, uprightness serves other functions; most evolutionary traits arise from multiple, overlapping drivers. For example, freeing the hands via bipedalism aids in tool use during movement. Yet the persistence of bipedalism over millions of years is inseparable from the increasing cooperation fostered by human Virtue Selection. From the moment our ancestors stood upright, humans chose a new path—one where tight cooperation defines species competitiveness. Uprightness bound humans together, analogous to the intercellular bridges that emerged in early multicellular organisms. This foundation enabled the subsequent development of Virtue Selection, language, and even science and technology.  

### Reassessing Tool Making and Use  

We have discussed many tool-using animals, but why are tool *makers* so rare? It is not because crafting simple stone tools requires exceptional intelligence, nor that most animals lack the capacity to evolve such intelligence. The issue lies in a biological taboo: *reliance on external objects*. The energy and time costs of creating external tools carry significant risks. As previously noted, brood parasitism (a grabbing strategy) plagues egg-laying animals that care for young, driving the evolution of defense and recognition mechanisms to ensure species survival.

Similarly, [we can almost predict that all species evolving the ability to make tools will undergo a "theft-and-robbery era" test.]() The act of stealing others' belongings is an easily evolved phenomenon. If a species evolves the capability of "skilled craftsmen"—becoming daily obsessed with creating various exquisite and functional stone tools—this would indeed enhance their quality of life and broad-sense fitness. However, a problem arises: if some individuals within this species counter-evolve thievery and robbery skills, these thieves could effortlessly seize the fruits of the "skilled craftsmen," significantly boosting their own fitness. Conversely, the fitness of the "skilled craftsmen" would decline sharply. Eventually, everyone would prefer theft and robbery over tool-making. Thus, preventing theft and robbery is a prerequisite for "skilled craftsmen" to enter an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Yet, evolving such virtue selection mechanisms to prevent theft is extremely difficult, which explains why the biological world rarely hosts "skilled craftsmen" species that make tools independently—they cannot survive the "theft-and-robbery era." However, theft and robbery are universally condemned and punished in all human societies. In primitive societies with extremely scarce survival resources, every external possession—fur coats, stone tools, stored food—was critical to the survival of vulnerable humans. Without sufficiently robust mechanisms to penalize theft and reduce theft-prone genes, the entire Stone Age would have been impossible to form.  

We can easily imagine scenarios of "Reverse Selection": for instance, if humans rarely evolve a skilled craftsman with the most advanced brain of their time, capable of making useful stone tools, but with an average physique (or even a weaker body due to high energy consumption by the brain), while another physically strong individual covets their tools—a scraper for easily accessing thick meat, an axe for efficiently processing wood. This strong individual could easily seize the tools through theft or robbery. Without a third-party virtue selection mechanism to uphold justice, the skilled craftsman would quickly be eliminated by Grabbingism. [Such a society, highly dependent on external extensions (tools), would be impossible to establish.]()  

During the transition from the Sui to Tang dynasties, the poet Wang Fanzhi wrote a doggerel titled *Craftsmen, Do Not Learn Skill*: "Craftsmen, do not learn skill; skill will only make you others’ servant. Your body becomes a natural slave, your wife a servant to officials too." He argued that craftsmen should avoid mastering too refined techniques, as greater skill only invited exploitation by authorities without commensurate reward—leaving more skilled craftsmen worse off. Similarly, if primitive humans lacked basic moral constraints, indulged in theft, and faced no punishment, the broad-sense fitness of tool-making craftsmen would plummet: their tools, crafted with time and effort, could be easily stolen by grabbers, making tool-making less advantageous than inaction. Thus, whether virtue selection mechanisms are disrupted or nonexistent, adept tool-makers gain no advantage. The Stone Age, marked by the flourishing of tools and other external extensions, is unique because such private property forms are rare in other species. [Without sound morality and reward-punishment mechanisms to sustain it, the beginning and prosperity of the Stone Age would lack foundation. Therefore, the evolutionary conditions for tool-making and use still hinge on the Virtue Selection Mechanism.]()  

### Re-examining Language Capability  
As mentioned earlier, the evolution of vocalization is not particularly challenging. The evolution of symbolic language and abstract logic does depend on brain development. However, the reason complex language became an evolutionary trend lies in [its underlying foundation: the highly cooperative relationships humans had already established, and its evolutionary impetus: serving the Virtue Selection Mechanism.]()  

It is easy to imagine that if human cooperation were less intensive—if competition outweighed cooperation—sharing information through language would disadvantage individual competition. While the principle of local genetic relatedness might explain the evolution of alarm calls, higher-level altruistic behaviors (e.g., sharing food sources) are harder to justify. Only under the Virtue Selection Mechanism can such advanced altruism be catalyzed, [and only then does a more sophisticated language system hold purpose.]()[Before the emergence of the ability to discern Virtue and Evil, before the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism, and before the foundation of cooperation, advanced language capabilities would have been nearly useless.]()  

On the other hand, the Virtue Selection Mechanism requires individuals to acquire comprehensive information about fellow group members—[the need for "gossip." Thus, complex linguistic logic becomes necessary.]() Like the brain, language’s evolution is not overly difficult (as evidenced by its emergence in just hundreds of thousands of years). The true challenge lies in establishing a positive evolutionary momentum. The Virtue Selection Mechanism and the highly mutualistic social forms it supports are the optimal means to build this momentum. Thus, language enables cooperation to transcend space and human knowledge/experience to explode exponentially—but language itself is a product of the trend toward high cooperation and the Virtue Selection Mechanism.  

### Other Rare Human Traits  
In addition to bipedalism, hair loss, a developed brain, tool-making, and complex language, humans possess numerous traits rare in the biological world. Let us analyze these together: concealed ovulation, covert copulation, frequent sexual activity, and menopause.  

#### Concealed Ovulation  
Scientists note that female primates have distinct menstrual and estrous cycles affecting their physiology. Menstruation is unique to primates, while estrus affects all female mammals. For example, chimpanzees, baboons, and most macaques exhibit genital swelling, bright red coloration, and unique odors during ovulation (when eggs are fertilizable). During this period, females display strong sexual desire, seeking mates, while males actively court them. Except for humans, most animals do not conceal ovulation; instead, they amplify it to incite male competition.  

Humans differ: hominin females show no visible signs of ovulation. This seemingly abnormal behavior becomes explicable only when considered within humanity’s unique survival strategy. In human societies, cooperation—not individual competition, let alone competition through physical force—is the main thread—[for humans’ success in the biological world relies not on brute strength, but on cooperation, order, and the cooperative dividends generated by intelligence.]() Thus, in groups that evolved concealed ovulation, male-male conflict over mating rights diminished, reducing internal strife and preventing concentrated interest conflicts. Such groups became more cohesive, achieving higher cooperation levels and greater success in subsequent group competition. Hence, concealed ovulation was evolutionarily selected and fixed.  

#### Covert Copulation  
Covert copulation is another uniquely hominin phenomenon. Understanding the rationale behind concealed ovulation clarifies this trait: covert sex reduces intra-species jealousy and resentment, fostering more harmonious group dynamics. This is a critical preparation for human Dimension Ascension. Extending this principle, we observe that in human societies, women tend to avoid excessive exposure, with innate modesty about nudity. The adage "a woman adorns herself for those who appreciate her" aligns with this logic. Even extreme practices like Islamic veiling stem from this evolutionary principle.  

#### Frequent Sexual Activity  
In most animals, sex primarily serves reproduction, occurring mainly during estrus. Humans differ: sex occurs beyond ovulation, becoming part of daily life. Though energy-intensive (burning significant calories), this "indulgence" appears to contradict evolution. In reality, human frequent sex reflects our unique social cooperation. The basic unit of human cooperation is the male-female partnership, with human couples achieving cooperation levels unmatched in other species. How to sustain this bond long-term? Material exchange is fragile; thus, enduring sex and love—instinctually programmed with minimal cost—are nature’s optimal design, forging long-term bonds to maintain spousal cooperation. A similar pattern is observed in dolphins, another species with human-like traits.  

#### Menopause

### Menopause: A Rare Biological Trait  
Menopause is also a rare biological trait, currently observed only in humans and orcas. For most organisms, the sole purpose of survival is mating—to reproduce more offspring. If a creature loses its reproductive capacity yet continues to consume resources daily, it effectively occupies the ecological niche of its own descendants. Moreover, as an "experienced elder," it may even outcompete these younger individuals for survival, thereby "weeding out" its own progeny. This is disadvantageous to the species; in the resource-scarce natural world, such species would face elimination. Thus, for most organisms, the loss of reproductive ability typically coincides with the end of life. However, humans are exceptional: women can survive for a remarkably long time after menopause. To understand this phenomenon, we must consider humanity’s unique survival strategies.  

We know that the role of the elderly in human society far surpasses their role in other species. Experienced elders can not only identify areas prone to dangerous predators or toxic plants but also possess knowledge of disease treatment, food gathering, cultivation, and preservation methods, as well as patterns of celestial changes. Additionally, having lived longer and interacted with more individuals over time, they can clearly distinguish between virtuous and malicious people. They educate their descendants on whom to befriend and whom to avoid. **Consequently, such elderly individuals can only exert their significant influence within human societies characterized by exceptionally high levels of mutual aid and cooperation.** It is therefore no coincidence that menopause, this rare trait, exists only in human societies and in orca societies, which closely resemble human social structures.

### Deep Sleep Proportions and Sleeping Postures  
People rarely notice the distinctions between human deep sleep duration and sleeping postures compared to other animals. In fact, for herbivores at the bottom of the food chain, available sleep time is minimal, and many must sleep standing. Cows, for example, sleep only 4 hours daily, with just a dozen minutes of deep sleep; giraffes sleep 2 hours a day, with each deep sleep cycle lasting a mere 5 minutes, mostly in a standing, semi-conscious state. Carnivores at the top of the food chain, such as felines, sleep longer—up to 20 hours—to conserve energy, but their proportion of deep sleep remains low, and they typically sleep prone, ready to flee or fight at any moment. Cats and dogs are similar: they sleep over a dozen hours daily, but deep sleep accounts for only a few hours.  

In contrast, humans exhibit two striking anomalies: first, the "lying-flat" sleeping posture is extremely rare in the animal kingdom; second, humans achieve a 50% proportion of deep sleep (3–4 hours daily), which is also unparalleled. When studying nest-building abilities, deep sleep, and intelligence in primates, scientist David Samson found a strong correlation between sleep quality and intelligence. He thus posits that humanity’s exceptional intelligence is linked to its superior sleep quality compared to other animals.  

Why do other animals have poorer sleep quality? Why are humans alone in daring to lie flat and engage in prolonged deep sleep? The answer lies in humanity’s unique instinct for mutualistic cooperation. **Humans are the only species bold enough to unreservedly lower their defenses and entrust their unconscious selves to companions. This is why humans alone can fully unlock the brain’s potential.**  

---

### Rich Facial Expressions  
Biologists have long noted that humans exhibit far more varied and exaggerated facial expressions, with emotions readily displayed—particularly pain and sorrow. This is highly unusual among non-human organisms. From the perspective of three-dimensional life forms, human facial expressions are unnecessary and even detrimental to individual competition. If competitors can easily infer your psychological and physiological state through your expressions, you are at a disadvantage. As the adage goes, "knowing the enemy and oneself ensures victory in a hundred battles"; hiding one’s own information is critical to survival. In animal populations with intense individual competition, maintaining a calm, neutral expression is advantageous. Machiavelli, for instance, advised never to reveal your emotions, emphasizing the need to remain impassive—for shame, he argued, is worthless. From the lens of individual survival competition, this logic holds.  

Darwin, too, was perplexed by the human tendency to blush—a trait seemingly unique to our species, as outward displays of shame offer no individual benefit. To investigate, Darwin corresponded with friends worldwide, only to find that blushing is universal. Why, then, have humans evolved such "vulnerability-exposing" expressions? Because early human groups already possessed extraordinarily high levels of cooperation. Facial expressions serve as rapid channels for information exchange. In a group free of deceit, individuals can quickly assess others’ states and needs through their expressions. **Facial communication is faster and more direct than language, further enhancing the intimacy and efficiency of human cooperation.** Given that high-level individual cooperation is a uniquely human trait, rich and exaggerated facial expressions naturally emerged only in humans.  

Notably, human expressions are partially involuntary. Observing these hard-to-control micro-expressions reduces deception—a critical factor in sustaining cooperation. As discussed in the previous volume, progress lies not only in what we *can* do but, more importantly, in what we *cannot* do. Increasingly, scholars now analyze human trait evolution not through individual natural adaptation but through the lens of sociality and group selection pressures. Robert Boyd’s *The Human Condition: How Cooperation Made Us the World’s Most Successful Species* aligns closely with this perspective, and readers are encouraged to explore it further. **When we adopt the framework of Adversarial Evolution and delve deeper, we discover that nearly all of humanity’s unique (or "advanced") traits—compared to other three-dimensional life forms, including primate relatives—stem from cooperative relationships and social inclinations. These distinctivenesses arise from the Virtue Selection Mechanism and the Cooperative Ascension trends it supports, driving the evolution of four-dimensional life forms.**

### Animals Closest to Humans [Optional Reading]  
In a sense, the animals closest to humans may not be chimpanzees, but rather members of the Delphinidae family—dolphins and orcas.  

#### Dolphins  
The ocean, much like the African savanna, demands group cooperation for successful hunting. Dolphins have slightly larger brains than humans, though their brain-to-body ratio is slightly lower. Dolphin groups can number in the thousands. Their hunting behavior closely resembles that of Stone Age humans: using group coordination and relay tactics, they dominate the seas. Dolphins are known for their friendliness, playfulness, and curiosity. They form strong social bonds, with members caring deeply for one another. If an individual is injured and unable to keep up, others will not abandon it; instead, they cluster around, tending to it with apparent concern. During childbirth, female dolphins in the group act as midwives, surrounding the mother and calf to monitor the environment, ward off sharks, and protect against other large fish.  

This warmth is rooted in dolphins’ selfless altruism: healthy individuals will vigilantly care for injured or weak group members, even using their bodies to lift them to the surface to breathe (as dolphins, unlike fish, lack gills and must surface periodically). In New Zealand, a dolphin named "Moko" was observed repeatedly herding a female sperm whale and her calf, diverting them from a shallow path that would have caused stranding. There are also documented cases of dolphins rescuing humans, circling them in shark-infested waters to protect against attacks. Additionally, different dolphin species can communicate—for example, *BBC’s Blue Planet* documented a joint "celebration" between false killer whales and bottlenose dolphins.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d53915e-0299-4d78-8057-198dc435f9aa" /></p>  

#### Orcas  
Orca societies are quintessentially matrilineal: the social core is female, and offspring remain with their mothers rather than their fathers. Beyond matrilineality, orcas also exhibit a matriarchal structure, with entire pods led by elderly females. These female orcas can live over 80 years (recall that orcas, like humans, experience menopause). These elder matriarchs guide their pods using their vast accumulated knowledge and experience.

The matrilineal family constitutes the most fundamental and significant social unit among orcas, typically composed of a female orca, her offspring, and subsequent generations. These families average 5-6 members (with the largest recorded at 17 individuals) and generally span three generations (occasionally extending to four). Members of a matrilineal family maintain extremely close bonds, rarely separating for more than a few hours. Within the family, juvenile orcas systematically learn their pod’s language, social knowledge, and survival skills. When a family grows too large, it may split into a new family unit.  

Several related matrilineal families form a small social group, though bonds within these groups are less tight than in matrilineal families. Members of the same small group may separate for weeks or months before reuniting, yet their connections remain stronger than those with members of other groups. When the elder matriarch of a large family passes away, her family may fragment into smaller families that then form new small social groups.  

Clans consist of multiple small social groups sharing a common ancestor and similar dialects. Within a clan, groups with more similar "dialects" maintain closer relationships, while different clans exhibit distinct vocal tones. The highest organizational level in orca society is the "society," generally composed of several distinct clans. Unlike lower-level structures, societal composition does not depend on kinship or acoustic features but rather represents a purely social framework. In the eastern Pacific, there are five resident orca societies: Northern Residents, Southern Residents, South Alaskan Residents, West Alaskan Residents, and Northwest Pacific Residents.  

Occasionally, multiple pods collaborate to hunt large whales, though these alliances are temporary. Our understanding of offshore orca social structures remains limited; their groups are typically larger (20-75 members), with observed supergroups exceeding 200 individuals. Membership in these groups is dynamic, with significant interchange between pods.

Dolphins and orcas both belong to the Delphinidae family, making them close relatives. Observing these marine mammals offers a unique perspective: **bipedalism, tool use, and brain development are not inherently linked**. Instead, group cooperation and mutual aid correlate more strongly with brain evolution. These marine apex predators have also developed linguistic abilities, communicating through ultrasound production and perception—a process analogous to human evolutionary trajectories. Both species ascended to the top of terrestrial and marine food chains through exceptional cooperative capabilities, facing few natural predators.  

Orcas have a long history of collaboration with humans. In Eden Valley, a town in southern Australia, some believe this partnership dates back over 10,000 years, to the last Ice Age. Indigenous peoples refer to orcas as *beowas* ("brothers"). During migration seasons (May–September), orcas guide humpback or southern right whales into shallow bays, then signal humans near whaling stations to alert them to prey. Humans then kill the large whales. When hunting baleen whales (15–30 meters in length), orcas divide into three teams: one blocks escape routes in open water, a second prevents diving by positioning beneath the prey, and a third attacks the target. In return, whalers anchor the carcass in shallow waters or along the shore, allowing orcas to consume their preferred parts—the tongue and lips, a practice known as the "Tongue Rule." Only after a night do humans retrieve the carcass for blubber and bones. Three generations of the Davidson family have recounted partnerships with a pod led by an orca named "Old Tom." Indigenous peoples regard orcas as reincarnations of ancestors, believing their bodies house the spirits of lost whalers.  

### The Fundamental Distinction of Humanity  

By this point, the reader likely understands humanity’s fundamental distinction from other animals and the root cause of our unparalleled achievements and civilizational progress. It lies neither in bipedalism, increased brain size, nor toolmaking—nor even in language or writing. **As repeatedly demonstrated in the preceding volume, the defining feature that establishes humanity’s dominance and separates us from other species is our evolution of the "Virtue Selection" instinct, coupled with the large-scale establishment of "Virtue Selection" mechanisms in human society.** By eliminating cancerized and alienated individuals, humans gained the capacity for unreserved "trust" and "love," thereby acquiring the unprecedented "cooperative ability" of virtue. This drastically reduced cooperation costs, improved efficiency, and generated massive cooperative dividends. From this foundation, humanity embarked on a path of dimensional ascension distinct from most 3-dimensional life forms.  

While most 3-dimensional life struggles in the quagmire of the Law of Grabbing Deficit, humans pioneered Virtue Selection mechanisms, extricating ourselves from the cycle of mutually harmful grabbing and internal depletion—thereby rewriting the history of life.  

#### Defying "Nature" Through "Love"  

A key reason Virtue Selection and its associated virtue system are humanity’s defining trait is the extraordinary rarity and value of their evolution. These mechanisms enabled humanity’s dimensional ascension, akin to a gradient descent algorithm escaping a local optimum to enter a new optimization landscape—a statistically improbable feat. **The difficulty of virtuous altruism lies in its "defiance of nature" from the perspective of 3-dimensional life: it counters grabbing tendencies, resists entropy, sacrifices fitness, and even risks self-destruction.** The adaptive advantages of virtue only emerge slowly after escaping the local optimum of grabbing.  

This low-probability altruism—life’s greatest "love"—also characterizes prior dimensional ascensions, including the first archaea that "lovingly" hosted (rather than greedily consumed) mitochondria and chloroplasts, and the first eukaryotes that united neighboring cells through mutual aid, defense, and resource sharing. Humans have extended this love to entirely distinct macro-organisms, connecting diverse individuals through trust and love to form a transcendent symbiotic life entity spanning time and space. This entity includes not only humans but also countless animals, plants, and the Earth’s ecological system—thus creating an unprecedentedly vast symbiotic life form centered on humanity, from which the "Great Human" gradually emerges.

**Moreover, humanity’s Virtue Selection mechanism differs from the ancient "Individual Genetic Suppression" mechanisms of bees and ants (akin to 3-dimensional life’s ascension strategies). It preserves individual competition, maintains evolutionary vitality, and avoids "equalitarian complacency." In this regard, I argue Virtue Selection is "more advanced"—it indirectly gave rise to the most marvelous life phenomenon known: the human brain.**  

#### The Unique Mechanism Underlying a Unique Species  

The Virtue Selection-virtue system is uniquely human among known life forms. **Thus, Virtue Selection and its supporting virtue instinct are humanity’s fundamental distinction from animals.** Prior to this, humans were 3-dimensional beings: vulnerable primates, "the third chimpanzee," indistinct from most birds and beasts. Through millions of years of struggle, setbacks, perseverance, and "defiance of nature" in the name of love, humans developed a moral instinct for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection, with Virtue Selection as its maintenance mechanism. With the evolution of Virtue Selection and the "love" and altruism it sustains, humans—now united, cooperative, and competitive—ascended to 4-dimensional life, earning the designation *Homo sapiens*. From this point, wisdom flourished, tools were refined, and scientific revolutions began.  

The preface to *The History of the Romans* notes: "The Romans were less skilled in technology than the Etruscans, less intellectual than the Greeks, less physically strong than the Gauls, and less adept at commerce than the Carthaginians—yet they defeated all these peoples." Mr. Wang Shi attributes this to Roman tolerance, but deeper reflection reveals it stems from Roman moral character. Similarly, we may explain Homo sapiens’ success: slower than cheetahs, less ferocious than lions, poorer climbers than monkeys, less agile than cats, with weaker hearing than hares, slower reflexes than mice, worse eyesight than eagles, less robustness than gorillas, and even smaller brain size than Neanderthals. Yet we "defeated" these rivals, even harnessing them to our advantage—why?

That is the instinct of human virtue, an extraordinary power unique to humanity.  

### "Virtuous Humans"—A More Fitting Appellation Than "Homo sapiens"  
In fact, the "Allegory of the Sun" in *The Republic* by Socrates (Plato) already foreshadowed this truth long ago. It is Virtue that created the "sun," enabling humanity to perceive all things clearly. Virtue is the source of knowledge and truth. The human eye is a product of three-dimensional Virtue, while the human brain is a product of four-dimensional Virtue. Humanity has reached an unprecedented height in the direction of Virtue—of love and cooperation. Given the paramount and unique significance of Virtue, rather than terming this stage of humanity "Homo sapiens," it is more appropriate to call this group of humans, who have distinguished themselves through virtuous morality and achieved unparalleled success in the biological world by harnessing the Cooperative Dividend, "Virtuous Humans."  

Humans first established a cooperative community through the Virtue Selection mechanism, reaping immense Cooperative Dividends. These dividends shielded humanity from hunger and cold, providing the conditions for brain development. Owing to moral protection and communal consciousness, the stone tools crafted by humans finally enhanced their adaptability rather than being seized by grabbing individuals; through communal cooperation, the value of intellectual labor was continuously amplified, eventually surpassing a critical threshold and overcoming the decline in adaptability caused by the brain’s high energy consumption and various side effects. As cooperation grew ever closer and more extensive, language and writing emerged, enabling knowledge exchange across time and space, further magnifying the Cooperative Dividend, and ultimately giving rise to the most resplendent civilization in the known universe.  

All these distinctions between humanity and other species, humanity’s uniqueness and glory, began with the establishment of the Virtue Selection mechanism. With the Virtue Selection mechanism, even without wisdom, humanity could reshape wisdom; even without civilization, humanity could rebuild civilization. Yet without the instinct of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism and the Virtue Selection mechanism it established, Homo sapiens would likely have trudged dimly forward amid mutual grabbing strife, much like their other hominid relatives. Without the aid of division of labor and cooperation, the fragile human species would have been precarious, with oversized brains and neoteny becoming heavy burdens, wisdom lacking fertile ground to take root, and civilization consigned to an eternal night.  

> No need for words—the night curtain has drawn back  
> Knowing darkness, yet guarding light, unafraid to glimpse the future  
> Sounds soft and slow  
> Peach blossoms bloom, adorning the endless night  
> Misty pastels—moonlight accompanies an old friend’s return  
> Dreaming back to frontier passes, look  
> Returning from the mortal world, look  
> The sky opens, look  
> All things as companions, look  
> I see clouds like a sea, veiled in illusion  
> I summon stars, fading yet resplendent  
> I traverse oases, boundless and shoreless  
> I kiss rivers, spring fades, then returns  

It is now nearly unimaginable: through how many acts of mutual aid and love, how many moments of life-and-death solidarity, how many choices and sacrifices, how many crises and miracles, how many trials and perseverance, did such a fragile species as humanity inch by inch carve out its own space for survival, and step by step forge its resplendent civilization. Precisely because humanity took this step of Virtue Selection, the moral instinct of humanity and the pursuit of great ideals became a force unparalleled by any other species. Perhaps those humans of the time could truly be called deities walking upon the earth. And it is precisely at this point that humanity earns the name "Humanity"—a species distinct from most animals, standing triumphant on Earth, worthy of the title "the pinnacle of all living things."
