# Research Methods on Human Origins [Optional Reading]  
Studies on human origins involve interdisciplinary research fields such as archaeology, paleontology, anatomy, phylogeography, molecular biology, and genetic genetics. These different disciplines often arrive at nearly consistent conclusions through distinct approaches, corroborating each other. Thanks to the rapid advancements in science and technology in recent years, humanity has been fortunate to obtain a key to understanding itself, thereby opening a gateway to the timeline of human origins.  

## The Third Chimpanzee  
Before delving into a detailed analysis of the history of human origins, let us first situate humanity within the broader context of life evolution. In simple terms, this contextualization reveals that humans are, in fact, the third species of chimpanzee. Why are humans referred to as the third chimpanzee? Early anatomical evidence has long suggested a close relationship between humans and apes. However, traditional views still maintained that apes form a monophyletic group, positing that humans first diverged from the chimpanzee lineage, followed by the divergence of other apes. This can be seen as humanity’s final effort to preserve its dignity—attempting to draw a clear boundary with other apes to appear more "unique." The traditional perspective is akin to claiming that orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees are humanity’s cousins, with closer genetic relationships among the apes themselves. Yet, reality once again shattered human dignity—the actual situation is quite different. If we consider orangutans and gorillas as humanity’s cousins, then chimpanzees are nearly humanity’s siblings. For the genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees exceeds that between chimpanzees and other apes.

Consequently, the latest biological taxonomy has been revised: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans all belong to the family Hominidae (previously, Hominidae included only humans). Within Hominidae, orangutans are classified under the subfamily Ponginae; humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas belong to the subfamily Homininae. Upon further examination, the similarity between humans and chimpanzees is even greater than that between chimpanzees and gorillas, confirming that humans and chimpanzees are indeed close relatives.

Thus, referring to humans as the third chimpanzee is highly appropriate. However, some may object: on what basis do scientists reach such a definitive conclusion? This is attributed to molecular biology and gene sequencing technology. Studies by Goodman et al. on globin pseudogenes (pseudogenes are formerly functional genes that have lost their function and are no longer transcribed; mutations accumulated in pseudogenes do not affect organisms and are therefore not directed by natural selection, which should be understood in conjunction with the later-discussed neutral theory of molecular genetics) indicate that the similarity among humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas is far greater than their similarity to orangutans. Fourteen shared derived traits support chimpanzees and humans as sister groups, including short sequence deletions such as at positions 8469-8474 (we can assume that gene mutations involve changes, insertions, and deletions, and the probability of the same short sequence deletion is extremely low, suggesting that such deletions occurred in their common ancestor). Of course, to provide the public with a more intuitive understanding, there are multiple versions of the genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees, ranging from the initial 98.8%, to 96% in 2005 (Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome), and approximately 70% in 2012 (https://answersresearchjournal.org/chimpanzee-and-human-chromosomes/). However, what truly matters is that chimpanzees are genetically very close to humans among extant species. In fact, based on molecular biology and gene sequencing technology, we can not only determine the genetic relationships between species but also estimate the "divergence time" of these species.  

## The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution  
The neutral theory of molecular evolution—specifically, the theory of molecular evolution and neutral selection—is perhaps the most constructive theory in evolutionary studies since Darwin’s theory of evolution. It is necessary to briefly introduce this theory. In 1944, as Japanese forces were stalemated on the Chinese battlefield, a 20-year-old Motoo Kimura entered Kyoto University. To avoid being sent to the grim battlefield, Kimura joined a cytology laboratory to study genetics. After Japan’s unconditional surrender, Kimura had obtained a master’s degree in science and began research in population genetics. In the summer of 1953, Kimura went to the United States to further his studies in genetics, earning a PhD in 1956. He later returned to Japan to teach and conduct research at the National Institute of Genetics. In 1968, based on molecular biology research—specifically, the substitution rates of nucleotides and amino acids in nucleic acids and proteins, and the fact that these substitutions do not affect the function of biological macromolecules—Motoo Kimura proposed the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution.  

Molecular biology has provided numerous new tools for evolutionary research. One key tool is the ability to compare the amino acid sequences of key proteins or the nucleotide sequences of important genes across species at the molecular level, using the degree of sequence divergence to determine the genetic relationships between species. This method is far more convenient and accurate than relying on paleontological fossil evidence to determine species relationships. Many scholars have engaged in such work. Although nucleotide sequencing was not yet straightforward at the time, electrophoretic methods made it possible to conveniently compare differences between homologous proteins: by placing the proteins to be studied on a suitable gel matrix and applying an electric current, the proteins migrate forward. If the proteins are identical, they migrate at the same speed and direction. Once amino acid sequence differences exist between two proteins, they will migrate to different positions; the distance between them roughly indicates the extent of amino acid sequence divergence. Greater amino acid sequence divergence implies greater genetic sequence divergence, thus indicating a more distant genetic relationship between the species.  

Studies using this method on proteins performing the same function across different species—or even functionally identical but structurally distinct proteins within the same organism—revealed that although these proteins differ in structure, their efficiency in performing the same function is not significantly affected by amino acid sequence differences. A protein can perform its function effectively, and a slightly different protein can do the same. This further indicates that alleles controlling the same trait can take many forms. These experimental findings revealed that there are far more forms of proteins and traits than previously thought, which conflicts with the traditional notion of strong natural selection—many protein variations are inconsequential. In fact, Kimura’s discovery does not fundamentally contradict evolutionary theory but rather serves as a valuable complement. In reality, nature is, for the most part, "benevolent," nurturing biodiversity, tolerating various flaws in species, and regulating the process of elimination probabilistically.  

### The Molecular Clock  
Based on the neutral theory of molecular evolution, we can derive the concept of the "molecular clock." The neutral mutation theory posits that, over the long course of evolution, the same protein performing the same function in different species has a constant mutation rate, which is so stable that it can be used as a "molecular clock" to measure the rate of biological evolution—a key piece of evidence supporting the neutral mutation theory. Since the environment is constantly changing, the rate of natural selection should also be variable. However, the "molecular clock" provides counterevidence, demonstrating that the force of natural selection is not as strong at the molecular level, allowing the "molecular clock" to tick with remarkable precision.  

Kimura argued that the rate of evolution is proportional to the rate of gene mutation, and since mutations are most likely to occur during cell division, the molecular clock should be measured in generations. For species with shorter generation times, the molecular clock runs faster; for species with longer generation times, it runs slower. One piece of supporting evidence for Kimura’s theory is that many functional proteins are complex complexes with distinct regions of varying importance. Active regions, which perform the protein’s primary functions and are central to its structure, tend to have conserved amino acid sequences that change infrequently, resulting in slower evolutionary rates. Less critical regions, however, evolve more rapidly. For example, pseudogenes, as mentioned earlier, do not produce any phenotypic traits and are therefore unaffected by natural selection. These gene segments undergo neutral mutations at the most constant rate, making them crucial for studying species relationships and divergence times.

With the biological molecular clock, scientists can then relatively accurately estimate the approximate timings of various stages in humanity's evolutionary history. The suborder Haplorhini (anthropoids) is estimated to have diverged from the suborder Strepsirrhini (prosimians) within the order Primates approximately 77 million years ago. The superfamily Hominoidea (apes) then diverged from the superfamily Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) around 30 million years ago. Subsequently, the genus Pongo (orangutans) diverged from the subfamily Homininae (hominins) approximately 18 million years ago. Gorillas (genus Gorilla) diverged from the lineage leading to humans and chimpanzees around 8.6 million years ago. Finally, humans (Homo sapiens) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are estimated to have diverged into distinct species approximately 6.6 million years ago (it should be noted that these divergence time estimates contain discrepancies, are not the most recent academic data, and such discrepancies do not affect the primary arguments of this book).
