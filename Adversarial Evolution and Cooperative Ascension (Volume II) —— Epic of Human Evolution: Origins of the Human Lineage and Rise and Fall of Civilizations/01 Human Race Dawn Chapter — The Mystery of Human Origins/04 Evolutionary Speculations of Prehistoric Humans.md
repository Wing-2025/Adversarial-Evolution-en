# A Hypothesis on the Evolution of Prehistoric Humans  

Before delving into this chapter, it is necessary to clarify that this text will propose several new theories and modes of thinking, from which new conclusions differing from conventional views will be derived—these I term "hypotheses." Please note that whenever I use the term "hypothesis," it signifies a reasonable inference based on all known facts, without conclusive evidence. For historical matters influenced by complex factors and incomplete information, the underlying determinants are inevitably diverse. I aim to identify their commonalities and internal causes through the lens of Adversarial Evolution, though these conclusions may not be definitive. I hope readers will maintain a dialectical perspective while engaging with this content. Now, let us embark on an speculative journey into the prehistoric history of humanity.  

## The Paleolithic Age  

### The Human Evolutionary Roadmap  

Based on differences in DNA sequences and the principle of the molecular clock, it is hypothesized that humans and chimpanzees diverged 6 to 5 million years ago. However, the classification of hominin genera and species remains highly contested. This is largely due to the extreme scarcity of fossil specimens, which are also sparsely distributed in time and space, making it insufficient to distinguish whether observed differences are intraspecific or interspecific. It is often difficult to determine if an earlier species is the ancestor of a later one or merely a collateral relative of its actual ancestor.  

All early hominin fossils have been discovered in Africa, including some that are not universally recognized by paleoanthropologists, such as *Ardipithecus ramidus*. Among the widely accepted hominins, the most comprehensively supported by fossil evidence is *Australopithecus afarensis*, which lived 3.5 million years ago. The structure of their pelvis and lower limbs clearly indicates bipedal locomotion; otherwise, many of their features remain close to those of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, including a brain size of approximately 400 cm³.  

Subsequently, during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene, hominins diverged into multiple branches. One lineage, known as the robust australopithecines (*Paranthropus*), currently includes three named species. These robust australopithecines were relatively sturdy and likely began manufacturing stone tools, with the oldest such tools dating to 2.6–2.3 million years ago. However, the robust australopithecines eventually went extinct, leaving no genetic contribution to later *Homo sapiens*. Considering the entire history of hominin development, [we can faintly deduce such a pattern: hominin branches that evolved along the path of individual capability, including later Neanderthals, ultimately went extinct.]()  

The earliest fossils classified under the genus *Homo* date to approximately 1.9–1.5 million years ago. Initially referred to as *Homo habilis*, some anthropologists have reclassified these diverse specimens into *Homo habilis*, *Homo ergaster*, and *Homo rudolfensis* based on their variability. Broadly speaking, *Homo habilis* represents a "transitional hominin"—earlier specimens closely resemble *Australopithecus africanus*, while later ones can be classified under *Homo erectus*. The brain size of *Homo habilis* ranges from 610 to 800 cm³.  

Following this, hominin fossils from approximately 1.6 million to 200,000 years ago are referred to as *Homo erectus*. Most anthropologists consider *Homo habilis*, *Homo erectus*, and *Homo sapiens* to belong to the same evolutionary lineage. The average brain size of *Homo erectus* reached 1,000 cm³, continuing to increase over time. By at least 1 million years ago (possibly 1.7 million years ago), *Homo erectus* migrated from Africa to Asia, reaching as far east as China and Java. Throughout their range, *Homo erectus* is associated with the Acheulean stone tool technology.  

Between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago, *Homo erectus* began exhibiting more modern human traits, with brain size gradually increasing to 1,400 cm³. The most well-known of these populations are the Neanderthals (*Homo neanderthalensis*) in Europe and southwestern Asia. Neanderthals had robust, dense bones and large skulls, with brain sizes reaching up to 1,500 cm³—even larger than those of modern *Homo sapiens*. DNA sequencing indicates significant genetic differences between Neanderthals and modern humans (Green et al. 2010). Neanderthals did not go extinct until 20,000–30,000 years ago.

<p align="center">Top left: *Australopithecus afarensis* (2.9–3.8 million years ago); top middle: *Australopithecus africanus* (2.5 million years ago); top right: *Paranthropus boisei* (1–2 million years ago)</p>  
<p align="center">Bottom left: *Homo erectus* (70,000–1.8 million years ago); bottom middle: *Homo heidelbergensis* (200,000–700,000 years ago); bottom right: *Homo neanderthalensis* (28,000–200,000 years ago)</p>  

Another branch of *Homo erectus*, known as the Denisovans, diverged from Neanderthals approximately 300,000 years ago. By 280,000 years ago, they had reached the Jinniushan area in Liaoning, China. After 80,000 years of struggle for existence, they replaced the local *Homo erectus* (Peking Man) and became the human inhabitants of Northeast Asia. They later migrated repeatedly across the Chinese continent, eventually disappearing from the Siberian plains 20,000–30,000 years ago. The well-known Yuanmou Man (Yunnan), Lantian Man (Shaanxi), and Peking Man in China all belong to the *Homo erectus* lineage and later went extinct, leaving little genetic legacy.  

Modern *Homo sapiens* first appeared in Africa approximately 170,000 years ago, with anatomical features nearly indistinguishable from those of present-day humans. Modern humans coexisted with Neanderthals in the Middle East for much of the Neanderthals’ history. Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, modern humans migrated out of Africa, and by approximately 40,000 years ago, they had abruptly replaced Neanderthals in Europe. By 12,000 years ago—or possibly earlier—modern humans had spread from Northeast Asia across the Bering Land Bridge to northwestern North America, subsequently dispersing rapidly throughout the Americas.  

### Two Hypotheses  

Regarding the relationship between modern *Homo sapiens* and archaic humans (including Neanderthals and Denisovans), two primary hypotheses exist: [the multiregional hypothesis and the out-of-Africa hypothesis.]()  

Proponents of the multiregional hypothesis argue that archaic human populations in Africa and Eurasia independently evolved into modern humans, with gene flow between these populations facilitating the spread of modern human traits across different groups. According to this hypothesis, certain genetic differences observed in modern European and Asian populations can be traced back to differences between *Homo erectus* and archaic human populations dating to nearly 1 million years ago.  

The "two-wave out-of-Africa" hypothesis posits that after archaic humans migrated out of Africa (approximately 1 million years ago) and spread to Asia and Europe, modern humans evolved from archaic humans in Africa and migrated out of Africa a second time (approximately 100,000 years ago), spreading across the globe and replacing existing archaic human populations without significant interbreeding. In other words, modern humans, having evolved from African archaic humans, were genetically isolated from Neanderthals and other Eurasian archaic human populations. According to this hypothesis, nearly all archaic human populations worldwide went extinct due to group competition or climate change, meaning most genes in modern human populations are derived from the archaic humans that migrated out of Africa in the second wave.  

Given that closely related species often engage in [minor interbreeding]() (though most interbreeding does not produce fertile offspring, there is a small probability of fertile offspring), modern humans may still have acquired some Neanderthal or Denisovan genes, even if large-scale, frequent interbreeding between different human species did not occur.  

Early genetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) supported the out-of-Africa hypothesis. Subsequent, more comprehensive studies using both mtDNA and nuclear genes have largely corroborated this hypothesis. Collectively, they support the conclusion that European, Asian, and American populations descend from African populations that migrated through southwestern Asia (the Middle East) 50,000–100,000 years ago. The amount of genetic variation among hunter-gatherer populations in southern Africa, particularly in South Africa, is significantly higher than among populations outside Africa, aligning with expectations. Through analysis of DNA phylogenetic trees (primarily using mtDNA and the Y chromosome), scientists have even mapped a specific migration route for *Homo sapiens*:  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c6fbcc2-8322-4afc-8d13-71c031d1b7a2" />
</p>  

### Why Did Humans Migrate Out of Africa Twice and Conquer Other Human Species Worldwide?  

While actual evidence suggests the out-of-Africa hypothesis is closer to the truth, the multiregional hypothesis seems more intuitively plausible from a logical standpoint. [After all, according to classical evolutionary theory, archaic humans who had adapted to local environments over long periods would presumably not be outcompeted by "newcomer" humans migrating from Africa.]() Unless there is something exceptional about Africa. This raises an intriguing question: [Why was Africa able to evolve the human species, while other regions were not; and why was it precisely Africa that later evolved a more "advanced" human subspecies, which replaced the "archaic" humans across the world?]()  

It is worth noting that archaic humans worldwide were far from inferior. Take Neanderthals, for example: they had more developed muscles, better vision, and larger brains than modern humans. Their tool use and burial practices reflect a level of civilization not dissimilar to our own. This puzzle persisted until I watched the BBC documentary *Dynasties*.  

#### Group Hunting Behavior—Hyenas and Lions

Footage from a documentary once showed a lion cornered by a dozen hyenas, teetering on the brink of exhaustion. Just as it seemed the lion would be overwhelmed, an ally spotted the struggle and rushed to its aid. The hyenas, recognizing the shift in odds, quickly retreated.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df10465c-1112-43ee-912d-fb1549e4847d" />

</p>  
<p align="center">Rescued by an ally, escaping peril</p>  

On the African savanna, hyenas and lions primarily compete over food. No single species holds absolute dominance; the outcome hinges on the numerical balance of their respective groups at any given site. For instance, lions often drive hyenas away from kills, but if a hyena clan grows large enough—with a ratio exceeding 4:1 against lionesses and subadult lions—hyenas can repel the lions unless an adult male lion is present. In the Ngorongoro Crater, where hyena numbers surpass lions by a factor of 10, lions frequently scavenge from hyena leftovers. In the Serengeti and Timbavati, where lion and hyena populations are more balanced, each species scavenges from the other roughly equally. In Kruger National Park, hyenas scavenge far more from lions than vice versa.  

This is not an isolated case. *On the African savanna, group competition is a norm.* Whether among lions, hyenas, African wild dogs, or baboons, all excel in group cooperation. Such competition unfolds not only between species but also within the same species, among different matrilineal clans. Matrilineal structure likely prevails because kinship is easiest to trace in these groups. In the resource-scarce savanna, clans frequently engage in large-scale skirmishes over territory, water sources, and food—scenes vividly documented in the documentary *Dynasties*, which records a clash between two matrilineal African wild dog dynasties. The victor thrives, the vanquished fades; the success or failure of group competition often determines a clan’s trajectory toward prosperity or decline.  

This intense model of group competition seems uniquely suited to the open expanse of the African savanna. On one hand, *the savanna’s flatness makes solo hunting difficult*. Cooperative hunts, however, prove far more effective. For securing water or repelling competing group-oriented species, intra-species cooperation becomes indispensable. On the other hand, *the savanna’s openness offers little cover*. Solitary individuals face grave risk of attack by pack hunters; even the mightiest lion is vulnerable. Thus, survival has driven the evolution of comparable group cooperation mechanisms.  

In contrast, jungle environments demand less cooperation. Camouflage and concealment afford solitary survival, rendering large alliances less critical. Jungle terrain also undermines the efficacy of coordinated hunts, favoring lone predators. Hence, tigers and lions, both large felids, have diverged in survival strategies—a divergence deeply tied to their respective habitats. *Understanding this, we gain insight into why humans, the species most dependent on "cooperation," repeatedly evolved advanced populations in Africa and displaced human subspecies elsewhere.* Owing to differences in Adversarial Evolution environments, *human populations in other regions likely evolved toward "individual capability," with "cooperative capability" correspondingly regressing or stagnating*.  

Strikingly, the open ocean—vast and unbroken like the African savanna—also demands high levels of teamwork. Not coincidentally, oceanic apex predators like orcas and other cetaceans exhibit exceptional cooperation. Their hunting techniques mirror those of savanna lions. Yet marine life faces constraints: large, oxygen-intensive brains are harder to sustain, making the evolution of Virtue Selection mechanisms—requiring greater cognitive capacity—less feasible. This may explain why humans, a revolutionary species, first emerged on the African savanna rather than in the ocean. Without this unique ecological crucible driving group-based survival competition, Earth’s Virtue Selection mechanisms might have emerged far later—or not at all.  

### The Great Leap Period  

The Great Leap Period holds profound significance in human history, even regarded by some historians as the watershed dividing humans from animals. Before this period: humans diverged from their close relative, the chimpanzee, 6 million years ago; bipedalism emerged in Australopithecus 3.5 million years ago (recent discoveries in Sahelanthropus and Orrorin suggest it may have appeared even earlier); Homo habilis, skilled in stone tool use, arose 1.9 million years ago; Homo erectus emerged over 1.6 million years ago; Neanderthals, with brain sizes exceeding modern humans, appeared 400,000 years ago; and anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) first appeared in Africa 170,000 years ago. Yet until 40,000–50,000 years ago, humans remained marginal, vulnerable to extinction—no different from their ancestors and relatives.  

Only with the Great Leap Period, a global phenomenon, did humans rapidly develop civilization markers: language, writing, and cave art. Modern humans then expanded from Africa, colonizing the world and becoming "rulers" of their new territories. As the author of *The Third Chimpanzee* notes: "From the moment of the Great Leap, we truly became human. Within a few tens of thousands of years, we domesticated animals, developed agriculture and metallurgy, and invented writing. A small further step then produced the milestones of civilization—Leonardo da Vinci’s *Mona Lisa* (1503/1506), Beethoven’s *Eroica Symphony* (1804), Paris’s Eiffel Tower (1889), the Nazi gas chambers at Dachau, and Allied bombings of Dresden."  

#### Humans During the Great Leap Period  

Recent research indicates that modern humans colonized Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) 60,000–40,000 years ago, glacial Russia by 30,000 years ago, and the Americas via Siberian migrations by 13,000 years ago or earlier. With this expansion, humans first began reshaping the biosphere: altering landscapes through fire, overhunting Pleistocene megafauna to extinction. By the end of the last ice age, humans occupied all habitable regions except Pacific islands. They also drove Neanderthals to extinction.  

Scientists long debated whether climate change or human overhunting bore greater responsibility for these extinctions. Both likely played roles, but as we refine dating of these extinctions, evidence mounts: major extinctions in newly colonized regions—Siberia, Australia, and the Americas—correlate temporally with human arrival. These regions suffered the most severe losses: Australia and the Americas lost 70–80% of mammals over 44 kg; Europe lost ~40%; Africa, only ~14%. More recently, Pacific island species, naïve to humans, proved especially vulnerable. No comparable rapid extinctions occurred during prior rapid Pleistocene climate shifts, further implicating human activity.  

Let us examine the timing of megafauna extinctions preceding humanity’s global dominance:  

- **Australia (45,000–35,000 years ago):** Zygomaturus, Procoptodon (giant kangaroo), Sthenurus (giant short-faced kangaroo), Wonambi (marsupial lion), Thylacoleo (marsupial lion), Varanus priscus (giant lizard), and Dromornis (thunderbird) went extinct.

</p>  

- **North America (12,000–11,000 years ago):** Camelops (New World camel), Titanotylopus (titan camel), Hemiauchenia (American llama), Cervalces scotti (stag-moose), Euceratherium (shrub-ox), Bootherium (woodland muskox), Castoroides (giant beaver), Saiga (Mongolian antelope), Teratornis (teratorn), Titanis (terror bird), Dinomys (giant hutia), Nothrotheriops (desert ground sloth), Eremotherium (giant ground sloth), Paramylodon (harvestman sloth), Glyptodon (giant armadillo), Pampatherium (pampathere), Arctodus simus (short-faced bear), Tremarctos floridanus (Florida spectacled bear), Smilodon (saber-toothed cat), Homotherium (scimitar-toothed cat), Panthera atrox (American lion), Miracinonyx (American cheetah), Canis dirus (dire wolf), Mammuthus columbi (Columbian mammoth), Mammut americanum (American mastodon), Bison antiquus (ancient bison), Platygonus (flat-headed peccary), and others perished.

</p>  

- **South America (12,000–10,000 years ago):** Megatherium (giant ground sloth), Macrauchenia (litoptern), Glyptodontidae (giant armadillos), Pampatheriidae (pampatheres), Equus (South American horse), Toxodon (toxodont), Cuvieronius (Cuvier’s gomphothere), Stegomastodon (stegomastodon), Titanis (terror bird), and other species became extinct.

Siberia, approximately 20,000 years ago: woolly mammoths, woolly rhinos, and other species went extinct.

</p>
During the Great Leap Period, humans seemingly rose from obscurity to become the masters of Earth, galloping across all continents and swiftly defeating ancient apex predators without meeting significant resistance. What propelled our human ancestors to achieve this Great Leap Period? This remains an archaeological enigma, with scholars holding no consensus on the answer. Fossilized bones provide no clues. Perhaps it involves only 0.1% of human DNA. What minute genetic changes could have led to such profound consequences for humanity?

#### Hypotheses on the Causes of the Great Leap Period  
I posit that the Great Leap Period was likely driven by two primary factors. One was the increased specialization and technological innovation in weapon manufacturing, which boosted hunting efficiency. The other, and potentially more critical, was the gradual maturation of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism, which solidified the bonds of cooperation among humans. This enabled human communities to expand their cooperative scale to tribes of dozens, even hundreds or thousands of individuals. When large-scale cooperation became an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) for the human species, spring had arrived for our kind.  

Such cooperative scale unlocked new hunting strategies, such as group ambushes (evident in the abundant depictions of collective hunting in the cave paintings of Cro-Magnon hunting cultures). Without heightened Group Cooperation Degree, advanced linguistic communication, and even a measure of self-sacrifice and altruism, small groups would have struggled to hunt large animals successfully. With significant numerical advantage, humans could employ tactics like attrition warfare or overwhelming numbers. As long as they mastered collaborative skills, mustered appropriate courage, and utilized suitable tools, humans could easily subdue these large animals.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bbea68b-f18c-4144-bfe7-489c082861b2" />
</p>
I conjecture that humans of this period had evolved a nascent "sense of order"—orderly collaborative combat, equitable allocation of responsibilities and rights, and systematic distribution of spoils. All these processes required the Virtue Selection mechanism to sustain; otherwise, the phenomenon of "Bad Money Driving Out Good Money" (inferior individuals displacing superior ones) would have destabilized the community, pushing it toward collapse. With this level of cooperation, humans dared to target large mammals that no other pack-hunting species had ever dared to pursue—a vast "blue ocean market" at the time. Facing these apex predators (or apex defenders), few other animals besides humans would have ventured to challenge them. It was through swiftly occupying this blue ocean market that humans achieved explosive growth.  

Furthermore, large cooperative groups facilitated the emergence of specialized labor. It is plausible that full-time stone tool craftsmen emerged, while gathering and hunting were organized by dedicated individuals. Security could be managed through rotational or specialized night watches—all of which dramatically enhanced group competitiveness. If gifted artisans dedicated most of their lives to refining stone tools, they would have far more opportunities for innovation and invention than occasional makers. [Within these complex division-of-labor processes, Grabbingism and Free-Riderism could emerge at every stage. Without the protective rewards-and-punishments mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, the system would perpetually teeter on the brink of Reverse Selection and collapse.]  

In summary, the Great Leap Period was likely the confluence of several forces: increasingly advanced tools, tighter and more specialized division of labor, and the ever-expanding scale of human communal cooperation. [These factors do not manifest clearly in anatomical "hardware" features of humans, as they represent an upgrade to the species' "software"—the result of the continuous refinement and strengthening of the Virtue Selection mechanism within the human brain.]  

### Possible Reasons for the Decline of Neanderthals  
Preceding the Great Leap Period, humans first defeated their formidable competitors—the Neanderthals. From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, I will briefly analyze the underlying causes.  

Research indicates that while Neanderthals had larger brain volumes than Homo sapiens, their brain structures differed. Naomichi Ogihara and colleagues argue that Neanderthals had larger occipital lobes than early Homo sapiens. "The occipital lobe is the visual processing center," Ogihara explained. "Neanderthals may have required larger occipital lobes to compensate for the dimmer light conditions in Europe." They found significant differences in brain morphology between Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens; for instance, early Homo sapiens had larger cerebella. The cerebellum is associated with language comprehension and production, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, leading the researchers to conclude that early Homo sapiens excelled in these capacities compared to Neanderthals.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab8d8af-66dc-426e-aced-3c9c96fd7c82" />
</p>
In fact, by constructing statistical models of the human brain within virtual Neanderthal skulls, they discovered that prior to the extinction of Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens had relatively larger cerebella but smaller occipital regions compared to Neanderthals. Given the cerebellum's association with cognitive flexibility, language processing, and working memory, a more developed cerebellum generally correlates with stronger cognitive and social abilities. Though the cerebellum constitutes only 10% of the human brain's volume, it contains approximately 50% of its neurons. Long linked to physical functions (e.g., posture and respiration), recent research reveals its critical role in shaping conscious human behavior.  

Additionally, compared to Neanderthals, Homo sapiens have larger frontal lobes—the most recently evolved part of the brain, responsible for language, social interaction, emotion, and logical thinking, representing higher-order cognitive capacities.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abec43e6-9e2d-4663-85b5-792259db77e8" />
</p>
On the surface, the survival advantage of individual visual acuity would seem greater than that of language. Those with better vision could hunt more prey, gather more food, and dominate in combat. Yet the "creator" made a surprising choice: [it favored early humans with poorer vision, weaker muscles, smaller overall brain size, but a more developed cerebellum]. Why? Let us hypothesize: [the foundation of humanity's success in the biological world lies not in individual prowess, but in group cooperation. The larger and more cooperative the group, the greater its competitive advantage.]  

To further expand cooperative group size and enhance Group Cooperation Degree, the primary challenge was weeding out Grabbing and Free-Riding individuals within large groups, which required enforcing the rewards-and-punishments mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism on a broader scale. This demanded stronger linguistic communication abilities, as in large groups, one cannot maintain daily interaction with every member. Instead, assessments of others' Virtue and Evil rely on communication with third parties—an advantage provided by a developed cerebellum and frontal lobe. Through daily discourse, Homo sapiens evaluated the cooperative performance of individuals within large groups, ultimately rewarding collaborators and punishing grabbers. This enabled the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism to function in larger communities, culminating in [groups larger, more cooperative, and more unified than those of Neanderthals]. This "superiority" also stems from the fact that late Homo sapiens evolved in the competitive environment of the "African savanna," where group competition was intense.  

Thus, it becomes clear why Homo sapiens ultimately triumphed. A developed cerebellum catalyzed a qualitative breakthrough in Homo sapiens' Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism, elevating their cooperative group size to new heights. Early Homo sapiens groups were small—typically 30–50 individuals—relying primarily on gathering for sustenance. Late Homo sapiens, however, could organize large-scale hunts targeting mammoths, saber-toothed elephants, and other megafauna, pioneering unprecedented hunter art. This attests to the evolution of highly cooperative groups among modern Homo sapiens. In contrast, [though Neanderthals possessed innate advantages in individual capabilities, their hunting achievements paled in comparison to those of late Homo sapiens]. After leaving the African savanna, Neanderthals experienced more individual competition, leading to a degree of degradation in cooperative abilities. It was therefore logical that they were displaced by late Homo sapiens—second wave migrants from the African savanna—who possessed higher Group Cooperation Degree.  

## The Neolithic Age (Optional Reading)  
With the conclusion of the Great Leap Period, human footprints spread across the globe, and the Paleolithic Age drew to a close. The subsequent era is known as the Neolithic Age (neolithic). Beginning approximately 12,000 years ago, the Neolithic Age marked the end of the last Ice Age and spanned until roughly 5,000–2,000 years ago. The term "Neolithic Age" was first proposed by British archaeologist John Lubbock in 1865. Geologically falling within the Holocene epoch, it succeeded the Paleolithic Age, either directly or through a Mesolithic transitional phase, and represents the later stage of the Stone Age.

The Neolithic Age is closely linked to the process of Late Homo sapiens migrating out of Africa and spreading across the globe. After Late Homo sapiens left Africa, their stone tool production diverged significantly from that of Early Homo sapiens. No longer limited to the simple chipped tools used for cutting that had remained unchanged for millions of years, a diverse array of new stone tool types emerged, characterized by sophisticated crafting techniques and varied functional purposes. This further demonstrates that the level of specialized social division of labor and cooperation among the second wave of Late Homo sapiens migrating out of Africa far surpassed that of the Early Homo sapiens who initiated the Paleolithic Age. Archaeological remains such as pottery, bronze, ironware, jade artifacts, charred textile fragments, and rice phytoliths indicate that ancient technologies—including metal casting, agriculture, pottery-making, and textile production—were remarkably advanced several thousand years ago. Bronze and iron, being metal objects, are less commonly preserved over millennia; however, pottery and jade, which endure longer, are more frequently unearthed.  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a00896-d1f7-4f53-9bd3-d0b06fed8bf9" />  
</p>  

The archaeological site of Çatalhöyük in southern Turkey is one of the best-preserved Neolithic settlements. Studies of Çatalhöyük have deepened researchers’ understanding of the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to agricultural modes of living. Archaeologists have excavated over a dozen mud-brick houses at the 9,500-year-old site, estimating that up to 8,000 people may have resided there at one time. The houses were densely clustered, with residents accessing their homes through rooftop openings. The inhabitants of Çatalhöyük appear to have valued art and spirituality: they buried their dead beneath house floors, and their walls were adorned with murals of hunting men, bulls, and goddesses.  

The earliest evidence of agriculture comes from the archaeological site of Tell Abu Hureyra, a small village along the Euphrates River in modern-day Syria. Occupied from approximately 11,500 to 7,000 BCE, the community began harvesting wild grains around 9,700 BCE. Large stone tools for grinding grain were discovered at the site.  

In China, primitive agriculture and animal husbandry saw initial development during the Neolithic Age. The middle Neolithic period (approximately 7,500 to 5,000 years ago) can be divided into early and late phases. The early phase is represented by cultures such as Hemudu, Longqiu, Beixin, Banpo, and Pre-Daxi; the late phase by Yangshao, Majiabang, and Dawenkou. Polished stone tools became more diverse and exquisitely crafted, pottery-making techniques advanced significantly (with slow wheels used to refine vessel rims), and agriculture and animal husbandry flourished. The Yangtze River Basin entered the stage of irrigated agriculture, and pigs became a primary domesticated animal. Chinese human settlements grew in number and size, with the emergence of central settlements and large public cemeteries, reflecting the centripetal, egalitarian characteristics of social organization.  

[We observe that by the Neolithic period, the scale of human cooperation had rapidly expanded from groups of dozens to thousands or even tens of thousands—a qualitative transformation that could no longer be sustained by kin selection alone. During this era, Virtue Selection must have played a critical role in maintaining group cooperation.]  

### The Emergence of Agricultural Civilization  
Some scholars emphasize the significance of agricultural origins, [arguing that it constitutes the primary feature of the Neolithic Age or the core content of the Neolithic Revolution]. The developmental trajectories of this period varied greatly across regions. In some areas, pottery emerged long after the advent of agriculture, leading to the term “Pre-Pottery Neolithic” or “Aceramic Neolithic.” In others, pottery appeared over 10,000 years ago, yet agriculture and even polished stone tools remained undeveloped. Thus, the Neolithic Age cannot be defined solely by the presence of all three characteristics (polished tools, pottery, and agriculture). Nevertheless, the emergence of agricultural civilization revolutionized human society.  

The term “Neolithic Revolution,” coined by Australian archaeologist V. Gordon Childe in 1935, describes the pivotal period when humans began cultivating plants, domesticating animals for food, and establishing permanent settlements. In fact, the oldest and most renowned human civilizations are quintessentially agricultural. [Agricultural civilizations are also referred to as Irrigation Civilizations or River Civilizations. The world’s oldest human civilizations—Sumerian (including later Babylonian), Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Indian, and Ancient Chinese—are all River Civilizations, arising respectively in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys.]  

River Civilizations originated in large river basins, where abundant irrigation water, flat terrain, relatively fertile soil, and temperate climates supported human settlement and crop cultivation, meeting basic survival needs and fostering agricultural development. Rooted in agrarian economies, these civilizations exhibited strong dependence on natural environments. In the river basins of ancient North Africa and Asia, vast fertile lands and convenient irrigation created favorable conditions for human survival. Early inhabitants developed labor divisions and thrived, making these regions the cradles of human civilization. Beyond their role as civilizational birthplaces, River Civilizations marked a milestone in humanity’s Adversarial Evolution—they intensified human group centralization [and imposed new demands on human cooperation mechanisms, spurring the incipient formation of "Virtue Selection" mechanisms such as laws, which rely on public authority].

#### The Earliest Agricultural Civilizations  
A joint archaeological team from the University of Southern Mississippi, the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Egyptian Geological Survey discovered the world’s earliest known agricultural cultural site during fieldwork in the Nile Valley of southern Egypt in 1982. Located in the dried wadi of Wadi Kubbaniya near Aswan, six sites dating to the Late Paleolithic (approximately 17,000–18,300 years ago) were identified. The site’s deposits include fossil and dune layers, characteristic of Nile floodplains. [Whereas foraging bands required ten square kilometers to support one person, early agricultural civilizations could sustain 50–100 people per square kilometer.]  

The earliest true farming villages emerged in Southwest Asia around 10,500 years ago. The village of Abu Hureyra, on the modern Turkey-Syria border, exemplifies this rapid transition. Around 10,500 years ago, a village with reed-roofed, wooden-walled pit houses was established. Its inhabitants consumed grains but also hunted deer, which arrived seasonally in large numbers and were stored. These communities thus stored both meat and grains, likely cultivating certain grains and possibly herding wild deer. Agriculture and animal husbandry developed rapidly after 10,500 years ago, with the village population growing to approximately 300–400.  

Owing to advancements in farming and irrigation, agricultural communities far exceeded hunter-gatherer groups in scale. Beyond increased size, population density exploded, and the trend toward intensive production and labor specialization heightened reliance on robust mechanisms to sustain human cooperation and prevent Reverse Selection. [Consequently, the moral systems of agricultural civilizations likely developed during this period through the gradual operation of "Virtue Selection" mechanisms.] Traits such as diligence, courage, honesty, professionalism, craftsmanship, and innovation were shaped during this era. These ancient agricultural civilizations achieved scientific and technological feats surpassing their time and produced cultural legacies that continue to awe later generations.  

### The Domestication of Plants and Animals  
Approximately 10,000 years ago, humans initiated the grand project of domestication—a groundbreaking departure from their roles as top consumers and grabbers. [From this point, the human species began to sustain itself through large-scale symbiotic relationships, adopting a more sustainable development strategy.] The chronological and regional patterns of human domestication of plants and animals can be observed in the following table (earliest evidence of plant and animal domestication):

Certain species are more responsive to selective manipulation. Indeed, some promising candidates for domestication appear pre-adapted to the process. Of the countless wild species “interviewed” by humans for domestication, only a small fraction passed the test; in some regions, none did. The nutritional accessibility and domesticability of plants and animals were thus decisive factors in the geographic distribution of early agriculture—and consequently, in shaping the trajectory of subsequent human history. Of tens of millions of plant species, only hundreds were successfully domesticated.  

## The Bronze Age and Iron Age (Optional Reading)

After the end of the Stone Age, humanity entered the Bronze Age and then the Iron Age. The timing of this transition varied across different regions of the world. In southern Iran and Mesopotamia, bronze was already in use between 4000–3000 BCE. By 4000–3000 BCE, Europe had also adopted bronze, followed by India and Egypt between 3000–2000 BCE. Bronze technology spread to Africa outside of Egypt and North Africa later, no later than 1000 BCE–the turn of the Common Era. The Americas did not develop copper-smelting centers until nearly the 11th century CE. China, however, mastered bronze smelting techniques by 3000 BCE. [The complex process of bronze smelting reflected an advanced form of division of labor and cooperation within early human communities.]() In ancient China, natural copper was initially used; by the early Shang Dynasty, pyrometallurgical smelting of copper-tin alloy bronze had been developed. The smelting process was intricate: selected ore was first mixed with flux, placed in a smelting furnace, and melted with charcoal. Once the proper temperature was reached, refined copper liquid was extracted, and slag discarded to obtain crude copper. This crude copper required further purification to yield pure red copper, which was then alloyed with tin and lead to form bronze. [Thus, bronze smelting demanded not only large numbers of laborers working together but also technical improvements and innovations across each stage of production. It imposed new requirements on group cooperation.]()[As previously noted, a clear主线 (central thread) in human societal development has been the continuous increase in *Group Cooperation Degree*](). According to the *Law of Cooperative Dividend*, tighter cooperation reduces internal friction, enables the full expression of individual capabilities, and elevates collective productivity. Mechanisms that enhance cooperation are therefore preserved and amplified, while those that hinder it are discarded. It should be emphasized that this "cooperation" differs fundamentally from mere socializing or gregariousness. Within cooperative systems, individuals must fully express their individuality and independent thinking, for cooperation itself is rooted in division of labor. Only individuals with strong independent thinking can inject innovation into cooperative systems, expand the cognitive boundaries of the group, and open new frontiers for specialized collaboration. With the advent of writing, different civilizations began to record their own histories. This concludes our narrative of prehistoric human evolution.  

## Milestone Events in Human Evolution: Historical Period (Optional Reading)  
Next, we will briefly examine key milestones in human evolution during the historical period. [Consistent with the prehistoric evolutionary theme, all major milestones in recorded human history are inseparably linked to *Cooperative Ascension*]().  

### The Emergence of Writing—A Explosion of Cooperative Dividends  
If language enabled human cooperation to transcend spatial barriers, writing enabled it to transcend temporal ones. Henceforth, humanity became an extraordinarily formidable species, capable of achievements surpassing the limits of genetic endowment. Individuals could now connect to a "world brain" across both space and time, contributing their ingenuity to its advancement. The collective wisdom of this world brain would far exceed the intellectual heights and dimensions attainable by any single biological individual in the past. From this point, human civilization crossed a tipping point: mathematics, physics, astronomy, geography, history, politics, and philosophy emerged sequentially. These传世经典 (classics) distilling the wisdom of predecessors grew and expanded across generations, forming the vast knowledge system we see today.  

### The Emergence of Law—The Foundation of Large-Scale Cooperation  
We know that Mesopotamia was a cradle of human civilization, a status tied to its geographical position: it lay closest to the African savanna, making it an early destination for humans migrating out of Africa. Additionally, it possessed the fertile alluvial plain known as the "Fertile Crescent." This provided the basis for transitioning from nomadic to agrarian life, which required large-scale division of labor and cooperation—demanding an upgrade to the *Virtue Selection Mechanism*. Thus, it is fitting that the advanced form of this mechanism—law—first emerged here. The earliest written legal code in human history is the *Code of Hammurabi* from Sumerian civilization. Some may view this code as documenting "Tit-for-Tat" principles, but it is in fact a quintessential *punitive mechanism* that employs Tit-for-Tat logic to reflect fairness and scientific rigor. Let us examine specific provisions of the *Code of Hammurabi*:  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baad0f88-ee2d-4fd3-b9c6-152adbe28c4b" />  
</p>  

> If any one steal cattle or sheep, or an ass, or a pig or a goat, if it belong to a god or to the court, the thief shall pay thirtyfold therefor; if they belonged to a freed man of the king he shall pay tenfold; if the thief has nothing with which to pay he shall be put to death.  
>  
> If any one steal the minor son of another, he shall be put to death.  
>  
> If any one break a hole into a house (to steal), he shall be put to death before that hole and be buried.  
>  
> If any one is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.  
>  
> If his son is still young, and cannot take possession, then the mother shall take two-thirds of the field and garden and keep the child.  
>  
> If any one open his ditches to water his crop, but is careless, and the water flood the field of his neighbor, then he shall pay his neighbor corn for his loss.  
>  
> If a man has intercourse with the wife of another man—who has never known any man, and if they are caught, then the man shall be put to death, but the wife may go free.  
>  
> If a man is taken prisoner in war, and there is no sustenance in his house, and his wife go to another house and bear children; and if later her husband return and come to his home, then that wife shall return to her husband, but the children follow their father.  
>  
> If she is not innocent, but leaves her husband, and ruins her house, neglecting her husband, this woman shall be cast into the water.  
>  
> If a man take a wife, and this woman give her husband a maid-servant, and she bear him children, but this man wishes to take another wife, this shall not be permitted; he shall not take a second wife.  
>  
> If a man commits incest with his daughter, he shall be driven from the place.  
>  
> If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.  
>  
> If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.  
>  
> If a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out.  
>  
> If a man hire an ox, and he break its leg or cut the ligament of its neck, he shall compensate the owner with oxen.  

In these laws from over 3,000 years ago, we see extensive provisions for punishing wrongdoing, aligning with the basic moral inclinations evolved in prehistoric humanity. The *Code of Hammurabi* represents the first recorded attempt to enforce moral judgment through public authority. While it has historical limitations as the earliest known legal code, it still demonstrates that the *Virtue Selection Mechanism* is a hallmark of successful civilizations. Notably, the code focuses heavily on punishing evil rather than rewarding virtue. This is because, in societies transitioning from animal-like "Grabbingism" to human civilization, [punishing evil required stronger enforcement than rewarding virtue, and the most effective form of rewarding virtue was precisely the punishment of evil](). Later, humanity developed more complex legal structures, including constitutions (the "law of laws"), judicial institutions, and law-enforcement agencies. [All these were designed to maintain the mechanism of rewarding virtue and punishing evil—i.e., the *Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism* of human society—through public authority and coercive power](). No accomplished civilization has ever neglected the critical role of law, whether in the *Code of Hammurabi*, the legal reforms of Shang Yang, the *Napoleonic Code*, or the birth of the U.S. Constitution.  

### The Axial Age—Multiple Upgrades to the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism  
With the development of agrarian civilizations and productive forces, the scale of human cooperative groups continued to expand. Between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, the size of cooperative groups in major populated regions worldwide crossed a threshold—the "Small States with Small Populations" threshold discussed later. At this point, humanity urgently required a more effective and efficient *Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism*. Thus unfolded the grand narrative of the Axial Age. During this period, sages across different regions "invented" distinct *Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms*, including rational philosophy, religion, and semi-philosophical/semi-religious systems. The pinnacle of rational philosophy was represented by the "Three Great Greeks," with Plato’s *The Republic* and *The Laws*, and Aristotle’s *Politics* as core texts. These works outlined visions for cooperative mechanisms in large human groups, exerting profound influence on later generations.

Second, the sages of ancient Judaism, ancient Iran, and ancient India invented religion to address the challenge of large-scale human group cooperation. The Old Testament records—long-lived prophets, the martyred Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah), who lived from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE and authored the Book of Isaiah; the Prophet of Lamentations Jeremiah (Jeremiah), active from the 7th to 6th centuries BCE, who wrote the Book of Jeremiah and the Shahnameh (Book of Kings); the Prophet Daniel (Daniel, 625–530 BCE), author of the Book of Daniel; and the Prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel), a 7th- to 6th-century BCE figure known as the "Father of Judaism" and author of the Book of Ezekiel. In ancient Iran, the Prophet Zarathustra (Germanized as Zoroaster, 628–551 BCE) reformed traditional polytheism, founding Zoroastrianism and becoming its core figure, with works including the Zent Avesta. In ancient India, Vardhamana Mahavira (Mahavira, 599–527 BCE), born in Vaishali, established Jainism; and Sakyamuni (Gautama Siddhartha), born in the ancient northern Indian kingdom of Kapilavastu (near modern-day Tilaurakot in southern Nepal), founded Buddhism. Almost all these influential and successful religions advocated upholding virtue and punishing evil, with the belief that virtue and evil would meet their due recompense, and guided people toward cooperative win-win outcomes through moral motivation. For a deeper analysis of the significance of religion, refer to the relevant sections in the concluding chapter.  

Finally, during the Axial Age, Chinese civilization centered its development on Confucian thought. Confucianism, grounded in rational philosophy, employed a religion-like faith to implement the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism. We know that the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism derived purely from Greek rational philosophy waned with the fall of Athens, particularly after the collapse of Rome—the most devout student of Athens. Meanwhile, the religious form of Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism became ineffective as scientific progress proclaimed "God is dead." In contrast, Confucianism’s semi-philosophical and semi-religious form of Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism endured the longest. However, Confucianism has been distorted beyond recognition through historical vicissitudes, a topic we will elaborate on in the next chapter.  

The sages of the Axial Age constructed the most powerful Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms in history through diverse approaches, [partially resolving the fundamental contradiction between the scale of human groups and the absence of effective cooperation maintenance mechanisms](), thereby supporting the subsequent long-lived ancient civilizations.  

### Market Economy—A New Chapter in Large-Scale Cooperation  

With the rise of science and the decline of religion, humanity urgently required a new Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism to sustain large-scale coordination. Enter the market economy. Unlike religion, which compelled Cooperative Ascension through fictional and deceptive means, the market economy achieved a profound transformation via market rules—the "invisible hand"—converting self-interested motives into altruistic outcomes. This most far-reaching human invention spurred multiple Industrial Revolutions and waves of technological advancement, propelling human productivity to unprecedented, unimaginable heights. Yet, the latent dangers embedded in the market economy have increasingly emerged, casting a long shadow over 21st-century human society. The role and drawbacks of the market economy will also be explored in depth in the following chapter.  

[Reviewing the entire prehistoric trajectory of humanity, we observe that all uniquely human traits and milestone advancements stem from upgrades in the degree of human communal cooperation; in turn, such upgrades depend on the continuous strengthening and refinement of the Virtue Selection mechanism.]()
