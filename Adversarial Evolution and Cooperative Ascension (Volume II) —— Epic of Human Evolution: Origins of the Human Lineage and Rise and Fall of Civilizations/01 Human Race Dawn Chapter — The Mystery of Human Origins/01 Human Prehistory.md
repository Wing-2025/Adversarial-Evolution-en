# Prehistoric Human History  

If we were to view the 4-billion-year history of life evolution as a single day, the ancestors of humanity would appear in the final minute of the final hour of this day. At their initial appearance, they were unremarkable—merely a third species of apes that seemed rather ordinary. The Great Leap, however, occurred only in the latter half of the final second of that final minute. During the first half of that second, humans remained inconspicuous, lost among the multitude of living beings, and even faced the constant risk of species extinction—much like many of their distant relatives that had already perished within that same minute. Yet in the latter half of that second—merely half a second—humans suddenly and explosively grew from an inconspicuous species, scaling mountains, traversing land, crossing oceans, and occupying the entire Earth; artistic forms such as cave paintings, poetry, and musical compositions emerged one after another; scientific and technological innovations like automobiles, airplanes, and skyscrapers completely transformed the planet's appearance.  

The spark of civilization seemed to be ignited in an instant, illuminating this blue and beautiful planet, even lighting up the Solar System and the Milky Way, and extending all the way to every corner of the cosmos we have come to know. From every perspective, humanity is a species full of marvels. In terms of civilizational achievements, no other species can come close. Over the course of Earth's evolutionary history, it is conservatively estimated that over 10 million species have emerged, yet none of the remaining over 10 million species—excluding humans—have been able to evolve a civilizational marvel akin to that of humanity.  

In terms of evolutionary pathways, since humans evolved bipedalism, dozens of subspecies have emerged. All hominid species with extremely close genetic relations to humans have perished within just a few million years. Yet it is solely the lineage of modern *Homo sapiens* that has not only survived but also, within a mere ten thousand years, created unprecedented civilizational marvels. Humans, who appear ordinary in all aspects, are truly the chosen ones among the multitudes of Earth's living beings.  

What did prehistoric humans experience to achieve these marvels? What are the underlying causes behind these marvels? Why was it humans—and only humans—rather than other species such as dinosaurs, ants, or chimpanzees, that created civilization? Why, over billions of years of evolutionary history, and across every corner of this blue planet's evolutionary arenas, has only humanity created unprecedented civilizational fruits? By what means did humans rise above the multitude and come to dominate the Earth?  

[In this chapter, we will gradually uncover the mysteries behind humanity's brilliant achievements and, in doing so, reveal a predetermined path of life evolution. In a sense, the farther we can see into the past, the farther we can see into the future. Studying humanity's past, its origins, and the enigma of its success is of utmost importance.]()
