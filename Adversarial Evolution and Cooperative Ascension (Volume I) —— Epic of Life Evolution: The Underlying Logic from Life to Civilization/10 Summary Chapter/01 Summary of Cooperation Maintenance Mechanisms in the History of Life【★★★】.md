This book concludes here. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to readers who have persisted in reading thus far—truly few are those who can fully comprehend this book, deeply grasp its value, and hold it in high regard. As this exceptional group of readers, I hope you will generously spread the ideas of this book to a broader audience. With the continuous improvement of public scientific literacy and logical thinking abilities, I believe the value of this book will eventually be recognized by more people. Only then can its role be truly realized; moreover, many of the problems and dilemmas facing human society may find concrete solutions through its insights. In truth, this book merely marks the beginning—it has opened up a wealth of unresolved topics, which deserve to be re-examined, re-recognized, and re-discussed. In the concluding section, I will attempt to further explore these topics, enabling a more concentrated understanding of the core perspectives and major assertions of this book.

# Summary of Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms in the History of Life 【★★★】  
Cooperation is the central theme of this book. We have repeatedly emphasized that *behind any reciprocal altruistic phenomenon that can withstand long-term scrutiny, there must lie an evolutionarily stable Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism that counters grabbing and safeguards cooperation*. These mechanisms are not only pivotal in countering grabbing and short-sightedness but also in sustaining cooperation and upholding high-dimensional life. They are the result of long-term group selection, the "wisdom" crystallized over hundreds of millions of years of life evolution, and a large-scale law of life evolution. I summarize these mechanisms in the following table, though I believe more mechanisms await discovery:

| Mechanisms Against Grabbing and Short-Sightedness | Examples |
|--|--|
| Symbiosis of single-celled organisms (endosymbiosis) | Eukaryotic cells (endosymbiosis of mitochondria and chloroplasts) |
| Individual genetic suppression mechanisms in cells | Various animals (reserving germ cells, cell specialization, selective gene expression, mRNA, telomere limitation, anti-cancer systems) |
| Immune system | Macrophages and T cells eliminating "traitorous" cells in the human body |
| Symbiosis of multicellular organisms | Clownfish and sea anemones; termites and fungus gardens |
| Individual genetic suppression mechanisms in multicellular organisms | Superorganism species such as ants and bees (methylation restricting gene expression, sterile worker insects) |
| Green Beard Model (helping "similar" individuals, excluding "dissimilar" ones) | Slime mold *Dictyostelium discoideum* |
| XY chromosome mechanism—preventing hereditary grabbing | Mammals |
| Imprinting gene mechanism—preventing hereditary grabbing | Mammals; hydatidiform mole phenomenon |
| Tit-for-tat mechanism (punishing non-cooperators) | Bats, rhizobia, lions, wolves, primates |
| Virtue Selection (Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection) mechanism | Humans; weaverbirds (primitive level); killer whales (possible) |
| Rites of Zhou-Morality-Law mechanism | Humans; enhanced version of the Virtue Selection mechanism |
| Market Economy Mechanism (Invisible Hand rewarding virtue and punishing evil) | Humans |
| Group selection | Nearly all mechanisms that resist internal grabbing and maintain cooperation are themselves outcomes of group selection. While group selection cannot hinder the ease of grabbing evolution, it can foster altruistic maintenance mechanisms |
