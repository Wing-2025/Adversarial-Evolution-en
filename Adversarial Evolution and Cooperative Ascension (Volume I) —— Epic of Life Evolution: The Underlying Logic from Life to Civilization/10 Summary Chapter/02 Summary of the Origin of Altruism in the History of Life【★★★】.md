# Summary of the Origin of Altruism in the History of Life【★★★】  
By this point in the book, we can now provide a relatively comprehensive answer to the following questions:  
- Can selfish genes only produce selfish individuals?  
- Is altruism necessarily eliminated by natural selection?  
- How exactly did altruistic behaviors in nature evolve?  

Although [altruistic phenomena are not easily observable in nature, particularly in the animal kingdom of the macroscopic world. Or perhaps such cooperative behaviors are so common that people take them for granted, such as cooperation between cells in multicellular organisms.]() under the drive of the Cooperative Dividend, the forms and mechanisms of altruism are actually highly diverse, and nearly all of these mechanisms have given rise to powerful species that dominate their respective niches. I have broadly summarized the origins and mechanisms of altruistic behaviors in the following table:  

<div align="center">  
| Altruistic Modes | Examples |  
|--|--|  
| Non-costly Cooperative Altruism | Birds flying in flocks, fish swimming in schools, penguins huddling for warmth |  
| Altruism Between Symbiotic Species | Eukaryotic cells, sea anemones and clownfish, termites and fungus gardens |  
| Material and Genetic Benefit Exchange Resulting from Sexual Selection | Mantises, certain spiders |  
| Principle of Spatiotemporal Locality of Kin Genes | Gazelles, avian warning calls |  
| Altruism Resulting from Kin Selection | Maternal hunting groups within wolf packs, lion prides, orca pods, etc., where members exhibit a degree of altruism |  
| Altruism within Superorganisms | Social insects such as ants, bees, and termites |  
| Green Beard Model | Slime mold *Dictyostelium discoideum* |  
| Altruism under the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism | Bats, yuccas and yucca moths, legumes and rhizobia, lions, wolves, many primates |  
| Altruism Sustained by the Virtue Selection Mechanism | Humans, social weaverbirds (primitive), orcas (possible) |
