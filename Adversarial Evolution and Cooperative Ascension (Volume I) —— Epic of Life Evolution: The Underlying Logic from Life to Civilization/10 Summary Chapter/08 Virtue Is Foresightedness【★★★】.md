# Virtue Is Foresightedness【★★★】
Although this book has repeatedly emphasized that the concept of "Virtue and Evil" mentioned here specifically refers to that defined by Adversarial Evolution, rather than the traditional sense of Virtue and Evil. I have also spent considerable effort interpreting the definitions of Virtue and Evil under the Adversarial Evolution theory. However, I believe it is only by the end of this book that we have a sufficiently mature context to discuss these concepts. In the previous section, we have discussed the "Foresightedness" of genes and its generative mechanisms. With this concept, we can provide a more accurate and concise definition of Virtue: [Virtue is the "sagacious" choice of selfish genes; Virtue embodies the "Foresightedness" of genes for their long-term existence.]() [Virtue is Foresightedness. Virtuous behaviors increase the likelihood of genes' long-term existence.]()

Precisely because the purpose of virtuous behaviors is to "enable" the genes of Virtue to exist with greater probability, ideally to exist eternally, virtuous behaviors pay closer attention to "Sustainability" and "long-term benefits." Genes that do not "care" about long-term benefits can scarcely endure. This "Foresightedness" was already prominently manifested when life forms transitioned from two dimensions to three dimensions. For example, we fear death, even if it will occur in one year or even ten years, and this fear causes us anxiety or panic, prompting us to find ways to avoid this future misfortune. This is quite inconceivable for two-dimensional life cells. The renewal cycle of human red blood cells is 4 months, white blood cells 20 days, and liver cells approximately 5 months; most human cells have a renewal cycle of less than six months. For these individual life forms, one year or even ten years is an extraordinarily long time—they would have died many generations over. Should they then "enjoy the present and worry about tomorrow when it comes," or "seize the day"? On the contrary, these "short-lived" two-dimensional lives exhaust their entire existence to "diligently" and "selflessly" contribute to the healthy functioning of the entire human body. The "Foresightedness" demonstrated by these small and humble two-dimensional life forms enables them to form a great community, supporting their genes to endure further.

Such "Foresightedness" is also manifested in the process of three-dimensional life ascending to four dimensions. Hymenopterans such as ants and bees are self-evident examples. Even humans widely exhibit such behaviors. Take the reforms of the Gracchi brothers, for instance. Their reforms contravened the core interests of the Senate class and even the Roman people. The Gracchi brothers themselves were not only from a prominent family in the Roman Senate but also Romans. Why did they act against their own people? Why did so many enlightened nobles follow them? What did the brothers strive for, one after another? Some might argue they sought to become emperors, which was indeed the rationale put forward by the Senate opposition at the time. They even absurdly claimed that the elder Gracchus intended to wear a crown based on a single gesture, thereby trampling Roman law and brutally killing over 300 reform supporters without trial. This incident evokes a famous quote by a British scholar: ["The so-called ignorant masses are those who, out of bias, regard all actions taken for political purposes—even noble ones—as driven by self-interest and personal desires."]() Hypocrites are most adept at exploiting this psychology of the "ignorant masses." It must be noted that Rome had no emperor at the time, and even if the Gracchi brothers acted against convention, there was little personal gain for them or their families. As members of Rome's most prominent family and individuals of exceptional ability, they started at the peak of success. By maintaining the status quo and proceeding as usual, they could have remained at that peak indefinitely. Why engage in such thankless efforts that risked their lives? The truth is that their genes possessed a stronger "Foresightedness"; they more acutely foresaw the future. They perceived the essence of Rome's problems: the corruption of the Roman Senate and even the Roman people themselves. This corruption would ultimately destroy their family's future and annihilate the Roman people. They recognized this centuries in advance, which gave them the unwavering resolve to implement reforms. External enemies are not fearsome; what is truly terrifying is internal decay and the unrestrained proliferation of cancerous cells within the community. Only a people with such Foresightedness can endure longer and progress further. Rome attained glory and longevity precisely because of genes like those of the Gracchi brothers, but it also accelerated its own demise by suppressing such genes prematurely.

From large-scale reforms and anti-corruption efforts to small acts of kindness, nearly all virtuous deeds embody this "Foresightedness" of selfish genes. These virtuous acts almost without exception sacrifice the short-term interests of individuals to pursue the maximization of the long-term interests of genes and the overall interests of the genetic community. [The Virtue and "Foresightedness" of two-dimensional life connect two-dimensional life forms into a unified whole across time and space, forming a three-dimensional life. Similarly, the Virtue and "Foresightedness" of three-dimensional life will further connect three-dimensional life forms into a larger whole across longer temporal scales and broader spatial scales, i.e., a four-dimensional life form.]() The magnitude of this temporal and spatial scale depends on the strength of Virtue and "Foresightedness."
