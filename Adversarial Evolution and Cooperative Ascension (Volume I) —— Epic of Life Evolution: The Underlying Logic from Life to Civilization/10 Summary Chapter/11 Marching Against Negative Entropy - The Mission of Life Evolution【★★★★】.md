Most alarmingly, a one-sided interpretation of the theory of evolution has made individuals degenerating toward grabbingism feel that their selfish and profit-grabbing behaviors are entirely justified; simultaneously, it has eroded the justified confidence of those rare individuals who preserve humanity's "original aspirations" in their actions, even plunging them into self-doubt. The adage "when humans think, God laughs" underscores the critical importance of precision and rigor in scientific theories—differing interpretations of the same theory can even result in a small discrepancy leading to a huge error. This is no less true for understandings of the theory of evolution. If people fixate solely on the animal kingdom, it is nearly impossible not to conjure images of the survival predicament of the law of the jungle; thus, it becomes readily comprehensible why the Hobbesian Jungle is perceived as the inevitable endpoint of such a worldview.  

Thus, it has become a key mission of the first volume of this book to [unfold before readers the broader history and marvels of life's evolution, employ a more penetrating perspective to discern the true essence of life, and utilize cross-dimensional thinking to comprehend the commonalities in life's evolution—thereby transforming this widespread misconception]().  

Through the layered analysis in this book, we have already faintly arrived at an equation of evolution that is closer to accuracy, diametrically opposed to the earlier conclusion, and more aligned with the shared aspirations instilled by human genes deep within the human heart:
