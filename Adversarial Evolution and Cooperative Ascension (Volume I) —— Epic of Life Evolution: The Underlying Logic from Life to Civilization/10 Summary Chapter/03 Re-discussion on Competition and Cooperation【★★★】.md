# On Competition and Cooperation Revisited【★★★】  
At first glance, competition and cooperation appear as two opposing concepts. However, billions of years of history of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension reveal that competition and cooperation are, in fact, a complementary and indispensable whole. [Competition, in essence, serves to test the degree of cooperation at the previous dimension, aiming to eliminate grabbing and hypocrisy genes within cooperative groups. It can be said that competition consolidates cooperation; while cooperation, in turn, serves as the foundation for individual competition at the next dimension, thus also being a means for competition.]() As the underlying logic revealed by the book’s title, *Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension*, competition and cooperation coexist and complement one another across different dimensions, jointly propelling the process of life’s Cooperative Ascension.  

Take the human body, for example—a highly complex life form. Referring to the human body as an "individual" is somewhat misleading. In fact, from the perspective of 2 billion years ago, a human individual would be perceived as a biological kingdom, or even a "biological planet." Back then, life existed solely as single-celled organisms. The human body, however, comprises approximately 40 to 60 trillion cells—a number nearly 10,000 times the global human population. It is difficult to imagine 6 billion people working in perfect unity and coordination; among them, there would inevitably be grabbers, free-riders, and even hypocrites. How much more so, then, for a biological kingdom of 60 trillion individuals? This underscores the importance of competition: it is precisely through competition among multicellular organisms that the genes of those with tighter cellular cooperation, where each cell is more "selfless" and "collectivist," are preserved.  

To address the issue of grabbing among numerous cells, multicellular organisms have undergone countless trials over billions of years. Eventually, mechanisms such as the "Immune System," "anti-cancer system," "germ cell retention," "individual genetic suppression," and "telomere restriction" emerged to counteract the tendency toward grabbing. Through competition among macroscopic individuals, those with stronger immune and anti-cancer systems survived, while those unable to resolve intercellular grabbing were eliminated.  

The term "competition" is imprecise, as it fails to distinguish between "contest" and "strife." The competition we advocate resembles a "contest," aiming for the survival of the fittest, rather than "strife," which leads to internal depletion and losses under the Law of Grabbing Deficit. Truly effective competition is contest-style competition. The significance of effective competition lies almost entirely in selecting genetic mechanisms with strong "cooperative capabilities." Most of what we perceive as "individual capabilities" can, in fact, be understood as "cooperative capabilities," albeit at different dimensional levels. For instance, a stronger physical constitution, seemingly an "individual capability," is actually a manifestation of the cooperative power of billions of cells in the muscular, motor, nervous, and immune systems—it is determined by the "cooperative capabilities" of two-dimensional life (cells). If these two-dimensional life forms (cells) have low cooperation degrees, with many lazy free-riders, hypocrites evading the immune system and only reproducing without contributing, or if the immune system itself has imperfect recognition functions and cannot efficiently eliminate grabbers and hypocrites, then the "individual capability" of the three-dimensional life form composed of these two-dimensional life forms will be weak. [Nearly all macroscopic biological capabilities are "cooperative abilities" emerging from the complex systems formed by the group cooperation of life forms at the previous dimension, all of which are manifestations of the Law of Cooperative Dividend.]()  

We are simply accustomed to viewing a human body or an animal as a highly unified whole, assuming it is "monolithic" and "in perfect unison." [However, this inertial, simplified way of thinking makes us blind to the complex Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms underlying it,]() neglecting the efforts and costs required to maintain "unison." For example, multicellular life forms possess highly developed immune systems. Traditionally, the immune system has been defined as a defense system against external invaders, but its evolutionary significance in detecting and eliminating "traitors" (broadly defined as cancer cells) may be even more critical. To this end, the immune systems of multicellular organisms have evolved to be extremely complex. The interactions involving T cells, neoantigens, and the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are among the most intricate in biology. [In fact, avoiding grabbing and better maintaining cooperation are the ultimate and enduring themes throughout the history of life’s evolution and dimensional ascension. The competition and survival of the fittest among high-dimensional life individuals, which in turn spurs the development of internal Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms, is a "crude yet effective" solution provided by nature.]()  

Regrettably, competition tends to devolve into grabbing, in which case cooperation among high-dimensional life forms not only fails to strengthen but may even regress or collapse. Thus, the [de-grabbing]() of competition becomes a necessary stage for ascending to higher dimensions. Humanity currently finds itself in such a stage. Moreover, even non-grabbing competition should not be overly intense, for we compete for long-term achievements, not short-term gains. In mathematical terms, [we pursue global optimal solutions, not local optima. Therefore, competition should be flexible and not fixated on immediate results.]()
