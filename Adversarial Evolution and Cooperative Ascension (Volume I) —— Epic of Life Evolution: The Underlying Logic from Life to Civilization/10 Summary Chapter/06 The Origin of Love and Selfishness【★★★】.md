# The Origins of Love and Selfishness【★★★】

## The Origin of Love  
If the Law of Cooperative Dividend is the meta-rule of this universe, then "love" in a broad sense is the most core and marvelous behavioral characteristic of the living world, built upon this meta-rule. Compared to the inanimate natural world, the living world is replete with "love" everywhere. [We might even regard "love" as the dividing line between the living and non-living worlds.]() Of course, the "love" I refer to here is love in a broad sense. [It manifests as a "willingness" to cooperate, as actions of providing assistance to other individuals, ceding "benefits," and making "sacrifices" for others to obtain greater overall "benefits." Ultimately, they merge into an indivisible whole. Indeed, the essence and origin of love lie precisely in the Law of Cooperative Dividend.]()  

This "love" pervades nearly all life activities across all dimensions. Over a billion years ago, when mitochondria were engulfed, they were not digested by the host cell but protected, with the host cell providing the material resources necessary for their survival. In return, mitochondria have, for generations, generated ATP energy for the host cell. This most ancient "love" is manifested in the host cell's "benevolence" and the mitochondria's "gratitude and reciprocation." This reciprocal "love"—supporting each other, coexisting without grabbing—destined these prokaryotic organisms to be "selected" as the primary framework for constructing future higher-life forms, namely eukaryotic cells. These two organisms with distinct genetic makeups have coexisted for over a billion years.  

Hundreds of millions of years later, around 560 million years ago, these eukaryotic life forms brewed a new "love" revolution. Single-celled eukaryotes clustered together, dividing labor and cooperating: cells responsible for digestion would transfer energy and materials to cells of other functions instead of "hoarding" them. Over time, these individual cells even evolved neural connections, sharing fortune and misfortune. These neural connections transmitted pain signals from various parts of the cellular cooperative to the central nervous system, which then sent reflex commands to unrelated cells, prompting them to collectively protect the injured individual. [This effort to protect other individuals with independent genetic makeup from harm is precisely the broad "love" I describe.]()  

As more time passed, multicellular life evolved immune systems, with some cells designated from birth as "guardians" of the organism. These immune cells dedicate themselves to eliminating invading bacteria from outside the organism and "traitors" from within, working tirelessly until their end. At the frontline of the human body are neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. These leukocytes engulf bacteria and small particles from the external environment through phagocytosis and pinocytosis. Eventually, phagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes, and through a series of metabolic mechanisms, the engulfed microorganisms are killed and degraded. After completing this process, the white blood cells themselves age and die. They spare no expense of their lives for the "greater collective" of the human body.  

Hundreds of millions of years later, a unique branch of multicellular organisms—humans—emerged. They evolved the rarest capacities for empathy, self-reflection, and universal love in the biological world, and with the aid of the Virtue Selection mechanism, they culled internal grabbers. Within groups, they united; within families, they supported each other; between spouses, they nurtured mutual care and affection. Through their concerted cooperation, they became unrivaled, swiftly dominating Earth and creating unprecedented civilizations.  

Thousands of years later, after conquering neighboring peoples such as the Sabines, Etruscans, Samnites, and Gauls, the Roman people did not enslave them but generously granted them citizenship, allowing their clans opportunities to become consuls and enter the Senate. Eventually, these peoples fully integrated into the Roman identity. It was precisely this spirit of universal love in early Romans that forged the Roman Empire, which endured for a millennium and spanned millions of square kilometers. Rome itself became an "eternal city" standing for a thousand years.  

Because of the "love" between life individuals, they form a new, indivisible "macro-individual." By the time their cooperation is seamless and their unity absolute, they have in fact achieved Dimension Ascension.

[It is precisely this broad "love" that integrates the chaotic natural world into organic life, creating localized order where cooperative dividends continuously emerge. These dividends, in turn, ensure that such loving life forms are selected by nature.]() Today, it is nearly impossible to distinguish whether life gave birth to "love" or "love" shaped life.  

## The Origin of Selfishness  

[Individual selfish behavior arises after Dimension Ascension.]() Selfishness is a fascinating phenomenon. We do not label non-living entities as selfish—we would not call a stone or a cup of water selfish. Only living beings exhibit selfishness. [Selfishness, in essence, is the "love" among the micro-individuals of a higher-dimensional life form.]() More precisely, it is the love of brain cells for other parts of the body, such as the cells in limbs. The brain cannot bear to see its body or limbs harmed, nor can it endure the pain they experience when injured. What is more extraordinary is that this love transcends time and space: in necessary circumstances, the brain may even command the harm of some of its own cells to secure a better survival state for other individuals in the future. Classic examples include geckos shedding their tails and warriors severing their own limbs. This behavior—devoting every effort, making meticulous calculations, and exacting retribution for the sake of the cooperative community—is the selfish behavior of living beings. [The origin of individual selfishness lies in the profound "love" among individuals of the previous dimension.]()  

[Love is the greatest miracle of life.]() From this perspective, selfishness is not shameful; rather, it is something life can take pride in, and it serves as a necessary foundation for the ascension of life through cooperation. Love among first-dimensional life forms shapes "selfish" second-dimensional life; love among second-dimensional life forms shapes "selfish" third-dimensional life; and love among third-dimensional life forms will certainly shape "selfish" fourth-dimensional life. [The "selfishness" of genes transcends all individual forms; it metaphorically represents the love among all carbon-based life and even other life forms. Genetic selfishness is, in fact, the most extensive love.]()  

[Thus, in the process of a biological "group" ascending dimensions, the "mutual love" among individuals manifests macroscopically as the "selfishness" of the whole. Through this process, "group" natural selection occurs, ultimately selecting the genes of "groups" that are sufficiently "selfish"—i.e., internally united through mutual love—thereby achieving Dimension Ascension and forming the "individual" of the next dimension.]()  

However, at this point, excessive and narrow "selfishness" becomes a barrier to further Dimension Ascension. When a species has entered the stage of ascending to the next dimension, if individuals exhibit excessive selfishness, it not only fails to drive "survival of the fittest" but instead triggers the "Reverse Selection" effect of "bad money driving out good money." This is because while other individuals cede benefits through altruism, selfish individuals seize extra benefits through self-interest without reciprocating equivalently. Over time, capable altruistic individuals face pressure to be eliminated, while less capable selfish individuals gain genetic advantages. The result is a population with diminished individual capabilities and cooperative capacities.  

[In such cases, excessive selfishness becomes a cancer, not only hindering Dimension Ascension but also negating the role of natural selection, leading to "Reverse Selection" and ultimately pushing the group into the Hobbesian Jungle State.]() For example, dinosaurs were paragons of second-dimensional life cooperation, with large dinosaurs boasting a total number of cells far exceeding that of humans. Their cells managed such a vast cellular "nation" with remarkable order, inspiring awe. However, individual dinosaurs were selfish, engaging in constant厮杀 and cannibalism. The "love" among dinosaur cells was confined to the second-dimensional life form, which ultimately meant that despite "ruling" Earth for 160 million years, their "society" remained in the Hobbesian Jungle State, never progressing to civilization. In contrast, the far weaker human individuals have forged a path of love, cooperation, order, and civilization, unlocking cooperative dividends and ascending dimensions.

Thus, "love" from the previous dimension evolves into "selfishness" in the next dimension. Selfishness originates from love but is confined to petty love; it is inherently reasonable, as no dimension's life form can exist without it. However, allowing such narrow selfishness to proliferate unchecked blocks the next round of Dimension Ascension, triggers "Reverse Selection," and ultimately leads to the Hobbesian Jungle State. [Therefore, in the process of Dimension Ascension, excessive individual selfishness must be continuously pruned; otherwise, it will be unfair to altruists and disrupt the ascension process. At this point, the selfishness born of love must further transcend, evolving from lower-dimensional love to higher-dimensional love, shifting from a "self-centered" to a "superego-centered" perspective, and transitioning from "self" to "superego."]()  

Thus, truly robust life forms should love both themselves and the entire life community. They should selfishly cherish themselves yet selflessly love others when cooperative dividends arise. They are both selfish and loving. In the process of Dimension Ascension, they use love to overcome the fear of selfishness, dissolve the greed of selfishness, conquer the desires of selfishness, and override lower-dimensional infatuation with higher-dimensional universal love, thereby achieving the ascension to the next dimension.
