# A Re-examination of Collectivism and Individualism【★★★】  
Collectivism undoubtedly embodies the most radiant aspect of human nature. It serves as an indispensable spiritual foundation for every successful nation, accompanying humanity through the trials and tribulations of history. Whether it was the Roman people who dominated the Mediterranean for a millennium, the indomitable Spartan warriors, the resplendent Bushido spirit of Japan akin to cherry blossoms, or the once-thriving Soviet regime inspired by communism—all bear witness to the profound power of collectivism. Collectivism is also the oldest and most cherished spiritual strength of the Chinese nation. Without it, the Chinese nation would have long since been reduced to crumbling ruins buried in history amid repeated foreign invasions. Take the most recent national crisis as an example: without collectivism, without the socialist ideal, and without the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives, fought selflessly, and advanced undaunted, the Chinese nation would likely have fallen, and there would be no hope of rejuvenation today.  

Does this mean Individualism is inherently negative? Not entirely. The term "Individualism" is somewhat broad; we might rephrase it as "respecting and harnessing individual value," which has been a critical ideological foundation for the West's success in the Industrial Revolution and market economy since the Renaissance. It can be said that without the full realization of individual value, humanity would not have achieved such fruitful civilizational accomplishments. [The core of this ideological current lies in: through competition, maximizing individual value, enabling individuals to contribute to the collective while achieving personal success, granting those who succeed greater genetic advantages, and weeding out Grabbingists and Free-Riders.]()  

However, an individual’s value should not be measured solely by "individual capabilities" such as physical strength, intelligence, or creativity; it should also encompass "cooperative capabilities"—integrity, honesty, a sense of justice, empathy, and collaborative spirit. A purely capability-based assessment of human value is shortsighted and perilous. Additionally, as previously noted, humanity has achieved tremendous civilizational leaps within the mere 10,000-year evolutionary span of the Holocene epoch. Collectivism has certainly played a role here: we were the first among Earth’s species to transition from Three-Dimensional Life to Quasi-Four-Dimensional Life, exerting a dimensional advantage over the dominant large mammals across the globe. Yet we must not forget: compared to older Four-Dimensional Life forms like ants, why has humanity achieved such rapid success? Ants have existed on Earth for over 100 million years and are comparable to humans as global dominators, but their growth has been far slower. [This is related to humanity’s ability to both embrace collectivism and maintain mechanisms for individual and small-group competition, which has drastically shortened our evolutionary cycle.]()  

From the perspective of the Adversarial Evolution theory, genuine collectivism must incorporate individualism, for a collective is composed of individuals—only a collective with strong individual cooperative and capability strengths can be robust. Conversely, genuine individualism exists to fulfill collectivism, driving Dimension Ascension by granting greater genetic advantages to those with stronger individual and cooperative capabilities. Individualism and collectivism complement and reinforce each other. [Individualism can be seen as the collectivism of the previous dimension; collectivism, in turn, can be seen as the individualism of the next dimension.]()  

Collectivism without individualism is incomplete; individualistic behaviors that harm collectivism must be eliminated. Most human conflicts are not clashes between justice and evil, [but rather conflicts where right contains wrong and wrong contains right.]() These are the most prone to spark large-scale tragedies, often arising from biases in understanding and emotional attachment to collectivism and individualism. This is why I dedicate such significant space to discussing them in the concluding section.  

Whether it is the cooperative spirit of collectivism or the competitive spirit of individualism, I hope that people can understand and respect the values each cherishes, thereby mitigating irrational actions stemming from subjective emotional extremism. Those who uphold collectivism should consider greater care for individuals and protection of outstanding individuals—key components of foresighted collectivism. They should not dismiss all "self-interest" outright, but rather understand the principle that a thoroughbred horse requires a full measure of grain. In particular, they should avoid moral coercion that forces collectivist-minded individuals into unnecessary sacrifices, which is akin to draining a pond to catch fish and constitutes the greatest harm to collectivism.  

Those who advocate for individualism and individual value must also recognize the necessity of collectivism, while employing scientific theories as tools for analysis and argumentation to distinguish between beneficial and harmful forms of individualism. With such understanding and awareness, I believe many human issues can be reasoned through, clarified, and prevented from descending into extremism and tragedy. [What we truly need to guard against is excessive individualism and excessive collectivism.]()  

Excessive individualism easily degenerates into Individual Grabbingism, causing significant internal friction and Grabbing Deficit within the collective. [Grabbing is the criterion for judging whether individualistic behaviors are beneficial or harmful.]() Excessive collectivism, on the one hand, may devolve into egalitarianism, where Free-Riders and Hypocrisyists gain immense genetic advantages, leading to Reverse Selection. On the other hand, it may transform into militarism or Group Grabbingism, [ultimately preventing Dimension Ascension.]()  

When espousing individualism, we must not forget [that genuine individualism includes "cooperative capabilities" and opposes Grabbing behaviors.]() Its core purpose is to continuously optimize individuals, unlocking their value to contribute more to the collective. While extolling collectivism, we must [remain vigilant against Free-Riding, moral coercion, and Reverse Selection, and be alert to the early signs of Group Grabbing.]()  

As we preserve collective pride, if our genes are sufficiently astute, they will also recognize this: other, more excellent collectives deserve our respect and support. Perhaps their genes are better suited for long-term survival. If so, let them carry our genetic fragments to explore greater unknowns. For our genes, taking a respite may not be a bad thing.
