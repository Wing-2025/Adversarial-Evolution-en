# A Re-examination of the Selfish Gene [★★★]  
I believe I have already clarified the issues with the "selfish gene" theory in the chapter *Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism*—specifically, that while its core proposition is correct, its inferences are flawed. However, given the profound influence of this theory on human thinking and the compelling nature of the conclusion that genes are selfish and myopic, it is worth revisiting the topic.  

First, this book endorses the assertion that "genes are selfish." What we oppose is the inference that "selfish genes" necessarily lead to "selfish individuals." Admittedly, selfish genes do often produce selfish individuals, and this is necessary—how else could an individual carrying genes survive if it lacked even basic self-interest? Yet the degree and manner of individual selfishness vary. Truly "foresighted" selfish genes produce individuals capable of long-term thinking, prioritizing the broader good, and sacrificing individual interests for the prolonged survival of their own genes.  

Consider a classic moral dilemma: if a button were placed before you, pressing it would immediately grant you extraordinary achievements, immense wealth, and universal admiration, but at the cost of humanity’s extinction in 100 years. Would you press it? From the perspective of a selfish individual, the answer is undoubtedly yes—for by then, the individual would long be dead, as King Louis XV of France famously put it: "After me, the flood." But from the perspective of selfish genes, which is more selfish: pressing the button or not? Clearly, not pressing it is more selfish, for if humanity perishes, one’s own genes will vanish as well. [At this point, genes, in order to prolong their own existence, must sacrifice the interests of specific individuals.]() Thus, the genes of King Louis XV were evidently neither sufficiently selfish nor astute—they were rather foolish genes.  

Let us modify the scenario: suppose not pressing the button would lead to your immediate death, while pressing it allows you to live a full life, but others will die in 100 years. Should selfish genes press the button? Clearly not—if others perish, your genes are unlikely to survive alone. Even if your individual genes are lost, the vast human gene pool will retain highly similar genetic sequences; most of your genes will persist. Sufficiently "astute" and "selfish" genes will still choose to sacrifice the individual to ensure genetic transmission.  

Let us modify it again: suppose not pressing the button leads to your imminent death, while pressing it causes the extinction of all Black people in 100 years (and you are not Black). Now, can selfish genes choose to save themselves? After all, your genes will still survive in 100 years. Some may believe their own race is superior, with "nobler" genes. Yet truly astute selfish genes will still reject this choice. For humanity’s developmental trajectory hinges on division of labor and cooperation. Even if different races have flaws, they also possess distinct advantages—[flaws and advantages are inherently intertwined](). Gain requires sacrifice. Diverse evolutionary paths seek optimal solutions within their respective "solution spaces," thereby establishing unique advantages. It is precisely this diversity that catalyzes the role of division of labor and cooperation. Individuals with distinct traits are akin to the "brain cells," "bone cells," "muscle cells," and "immune cells" of human society. As long as these genetic strategies adhere to the order of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism," diversity should be preserved as much as possible. Sacrificing numerous "muscle cells" or "bone cells" for a few "brain cells" would inevitably lead to the latter’s downfall—a highly unwise trade-off. Moreover, genetic diversity significantly reduces the risk of a supervirus accidentally wiping out humanity. Thus, sufficiently "selfish" and "astute" genes will still refuse to press the button.  

This leads to the [core question: how do genes achieve such "astuteness"? Or, put differently, how do they develop "foresightedness"?]() In traditional theoretical frameworks, genes are "selfish and myopic," with "myopia" seemingly inevitable. How can we expect cold, unfeeling genes to possess "foresightedness"? [This is not impossible—"foresightedness" is also a product of natural selection.]() The most striking example is the human body, where each cell can be viewed as a life form, yet they do not act excessively selfishly. Arm cells bravely protect body cells; bone cells unwaveringly support the entire body; macrophages abandon reproduction to become frontline warriors defending against foreign invaders in the body’s microbial environment. This is not to say that body cells lack myopic, grabbing tendencies—cancer cells are a case in point, and the "Altruism Paradox" nearly holds among cells. However, mechanisms such as "Individual Genetic Suppression," "cancer suppression systems," and others maintain the cooperative capacity of human cells. We have previously outlined numerous Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms: symbiosis, Individual Genetic Suppression, the green-beard model, the XY Chromosome Mechanism, the Imprinting Gene Mechanism, the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, the Virtue Selection Mechanism, and moral-legal mechanisms. [These Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms, which have emerged repeatedly over the long course of life’s evolution, are "designed" to enhance and preserve the "foresightedness" of genes. The theory of natural selection creates a刻板 impression that genes, in order to survive, must become myopic—focused only on survival tomorrow, with no thought for the day after. Yet Earth’s 3-billion-year evolutionary history tells a different story.]() From eukaryotes and multicellular organisms to ants and humans, life has overcome the myopia of selfish genes from various dimensions and angles to achieve Cooperative Ascension. Human genes are undoubtedly the most exceptional among these—highly "astute" and "foresighted." Rare virtues such as justice, compassion, bravery, fearlessness, and love have miraculously sprouted in humanity. Though degenerative pressures persist and tendencies toward grabbing and regression arise (as in the case of King Louis XV), these do not define all of humanity. [They cannot even represent the true human genes that have achieved glorious successes.]()  

Thus, [selfish genes do not necessarily produce selfish individuals; what matters is whether the genes are sufficiently "astute" and "foresighted." Such "foresightedness" often manifests in individuals as instincts that seem "foolish" from an individual perspective, as well as whether the genes have developed effective mechanisms to preserve these instincts and "foresightedness" within their groups.]()  

Misunderstandings of the selfish gene theory stem from two main sources. First, people often conflate "selfishness" with "myopia." In reality, "selfishness" merely means genes exert every effort to ensure their own prolonged existence—all traits expressed by genes ultimately aim to achieve this. Genes that fail to do so will be eliminated. The perception that genes are both selfish and myopic largely arises from superficial observations of the animal kingdom. For example, eagle chicks fight to the death over food instead of cooperating to forage; brood-parasitic birds constantly scheme to have other birds incubate their eggs while guarding against having their own eggs replaced. Why are their genes so myopic, showing no trace of cooperation or foresightedness? I do not deny that before Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms are established, genes will indeed tend toward increasing myopia. However, the genetic strategies we observe, though seemingly widespread, are not the ones that "ultimately triumph." Precisely because these species have not yet entered higher dimensions of cooperation, they face greater pressure to be eliminated. Moreover, we must note that even in these examples, from the perspective of single-celled organisms, both eagle chicks and brood-parasitic birds [can, without exaggeration, be called paragons of success through cooperation in the living world—for they are all multicellular organisms that have succeeded through close cooperation among cells]().  

Second, people often conflate "genes" with "individuals," which is a key source of misunderstanding regarding "selfish genes." In reality, no individual has identical genes in every cell. Each cell is itself a distinct "individual," and these "individuals" are not all "allies"—cancer cells are a case in point. Furthermore, even within a single cell reside "individuals" with different genes (e.g., mitochondria have distinct genes, and mitochondrial genes differ significantly from those of the host cell). Additionally, genes vary widely between different biological individuals, though many genetic segments are shared—among humans, this similarity exceeds 99.5%. In fact, all life on Earth descends from a common microbial ancestor, and all its descendants share a degree of genetic similarity and difference. Thus, "gene selfishness" and "individual selfishness" are entirely distinct concepts.

Genes are selfish, but individuals can be selfless; "foresighted" genes will always find ways to enhance individual cooperation, yet "foresighted" individuals may scheme and act cruelly for personal gain. As we have discussed, the most astute genes fully grasp the benefits of Cooperative Dividend and the necessity of Cooperative Ascension. The process of Cooperative Ascension has spanned billions of years of life’s evolution, transcending life’s scales from the macroscopic to the microscopic. However, this does not mean that intelligent individuals will necessarily endorse and defend the process of Dimension Ascension. [If intelligent individuals are paired with "foolish and myopic" genes—such as high-IQ criminals or astute corrupt officials—their existence often brings disaster to their groups. In reality, this is a tragedy caused by their own "foolish" genes.]()

This inevitably evokes my association with the choice faced by Neo in *The Matrix*: whether to take the blue pill and remain in the safe, beautiful virtual world, or take the red pill and confront the harsh reality. [The brain-computer interface, in theory, can satisfy all individual desires at low cost, which could be said to have fulfilled the ultimate needs of self-interested individuals.] Why does Neo’s unhesitating choice of the red pill earn greater approval from the audience? This spirit of adventure and resistance does not stem from the individual’s instinct of pursuing benefits and avoiding harm, but from the deliberate design of selfish genes. How could selfish genes allow all their carriers to be manipulated and resigned to fate? How could they permit their carriers to indulge in the virtual world, which undermines the sustainability of the genes themselves? All this truly threatens their long-term survival. Thus, genes have gone so far as to create Neo—a figure who dares to take risks, strive for resistance, and confront the raw truth even at the cost of injury or self-sacrifice. Only in the real world, by mastering tangible reality, can genes truly take control of their own destiny and achieve enduring existence.  

Today’s society lacks not the instinct to transcend individual self-interest by taking risks, making sacrifices, and devoting oneself for others. [What it lacks instead are the justifications to convince oneself; people cannot find a reasonable logic for dedication and sacrifice, and selflessness is even deemed shameful, a foolish act resulting from culturally distorted minds.] [In fact, the very selfishness of genes is precisely the most fundamental reason for individuals to become selfless.] What truly warrants concern is the excessive self-interest of individuals caused by the short-sightedness of genes; what truly demands vigilance are those selfish genes eroded by grabbing tendencies.  

As we have repeatedly emphasized, moderate self-interest in individuals is reasonable, and moderate competition among individuals aligns with the need for the long-term survival of selfish genes. However, this "moderation" is of critical importance. Once self-interest and competition exceed reasonable bounds, giving rise to grabbing tendencies, they will, in turn, disrupt the intricate chessboard painstakingly constructed by selfish genes over eons.  

Dawkins, in *The Selfish Gene*, exhorts people to find ways to escape the tyranny of selfish genes. [In reality, what people truly need to escape is the tyranny of "short-sighted" selfish genes. Once we truly comprehend the well-intentioned and exquisite design of "foresighted" selfish genes, we need only follow their ancient call from the depths of our being.]
