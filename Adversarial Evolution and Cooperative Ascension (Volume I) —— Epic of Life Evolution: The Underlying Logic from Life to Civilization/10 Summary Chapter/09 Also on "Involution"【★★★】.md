# On "Involution" 【★★★】  
No one can pinpoint exactly when the term "involution" suddenly gained popularity. People have engaged in lively discussions about their understandings of involution, with no shortage of witty and interesting interpretations. Perhaps "involution" holds a different definition in everyone's mind, but I tend to equate it with "Law of Grabbing Deficit."  

When discussing involution, a classic question arises: "Aren't you just resentful of involution because you can't compete effectively?" Competition has been one of the driving forces behind life's evolution over billions of years. Does this mean the more intense the competition, the better? While this book has addressed this question multiple times, it remains incompletely explored. Let us briefly summarize the drawbacks of excessive competition previously discussed: excessive competition compels individuals toward grabbing tendencies, thereby undermining cooperation.  

Does this mean that competition which appears fair on the surface—without direct grabbing behavior—is beneficial and the more intense the better? The answer is still no. First, we recognize that the general trend of life's development is toward Cooperative Ascension, with division of labor being an efficient form of cooperation. Division of labor requires individuals to develop distinct capabilities and characteristics. Excessive competition, however, does the opposite: it forces each individual to become more independent and comprehensive in capabilities. Being "comprehensive" in capabilities, in fact, means mediocrity across all dimensions, and this mediocrity tends toward homogenization—a trend contrary to the momentum of Cooperative Ascension. This is one of the issues with the college entrance exam system: the "single-log bridge" compels talent toward mediocrity and homogenization. The 108 heroes of *Water Margin* are celebrated precisely for their uniqueness; when the Eight Immortals cross the sea, we anticipate their distinct feats. For talent, we hope to see a thousand maple leaves each displaying a thousand unique beauties.  

Second, even if we aim to find optimal solutions, excessive competition is far from beneficial. Consider this conclusion: [No short-term success can represent long-term success; nearly all processes of excessively pursuing short-term benefits will inevitably harm long-term benefits.]() Why is this the case? A mathematical explanation clarifies this: optimization functions for nearly any complex problem are non-convex. To find the global optimal solution, one must repeatedly abandon and move beyond local optimal solutions. Those who overexert themselves to pursue short-term benefits are essentially fixating on local optimal solutions. This is not entirely negative, but their pursuit of short-term success indirectly seizes platforms and resources from those focused on long-term benefits, causing the latter to lose out in social competition or even be eliminated prematurely.  

Take the college entrance exam as an example: the exam itself represents only short-term, local success, yet some treat it as the ultimate goal for students, fixating on this local optimal solution. In reality, these acts of seizing platforms and resources through short-term victories constitute "Law of Grabbing Deficit"—this is involution. [In fact, involution is essentially a covert and indirect form of "Law of Grabbing Deficit," making it difficult for people to recognize. From both a contemporary and evolutionary perspective, involution undermines the "Law of Cooperative Dividend"; unlike healthy competition, it does not contribute to the generation of long-term cooperative dividends.]()  

Competition between companies follows a similar pattern. To pursue short-term corporate profits and maximize shareholder interests, companies cut research and development costs through imitation, dominate markets via intensive marketing, and extract employee productivity through PUA tactics. In fierce market competition, financial success becomes both a critical foundation and a "ticket" for subsequent success. The mission of corporate innovation is neglected; employees' long-term growth is sacrificed; companies mired in involution fail to produce meaningful positive impacts on science, technology, or social culture.  

Employees within such companies are no different. Some abandon long-term planning, optimal work states, and even physical health, personal interests, and self-learning—all to pursue short-term performance, seize promotion opportunities, and secure platforms for further personal value. This exhaustive exploitation gives rise to involution. Whether for companies or individuals, such radical short-term goal-oriented work makes technical accumulation difficult and innovation nearly impossible. Innovation demands the courage to abandon local optimal solutions, make bold conjectures, and continuously explore new solution spaces. This process inherently requires extensive time, with a high risk of failure, yet nearly all major scientific innovations in human history have emerged from such endeavors—not from fine-tuning local optimal solutions. The cooperative dividends generated by innovation represent qualitative, revolutionary advancements.  

From the perspective of life as a whole, the significance of this process becomes clear. If innovation is akin to discovering higher peaks on Earth, the optimal strategy for the human life community is to place individuals across every landmass, each searching for peaks in their vicinity. It is not to have all individuals scramble on a single known peak, wasting their potential. Nearly all of humanity's most brilliant innovations have not been achieved through involution.  

A prime example is Newton's 18-month isolation during the plague, during which he made major breakthroughs in calculus, optics, and the law of universal gravitation—foundations for his later scientific innovations. Darwin's long-term, nearly purely curious observations and records aboard the *Beagle*, along with his post-return reflections on the origins of evolution while convalescing in relative ease, ultimately led to the revolutionary *On the Origin of Species*. At 26, Einstein took an unglamorous job as a patent examiner—a清闲 (leisurely but unpromising position)—yet it was during his free time at this post that he published six scientific papers, laying the groundwork for relativity. Literary creation follows a similar pattern: Pushkin, confined to Boldino Village for three months due to cholera, produced his most important works during this "uneventful" period, now known as "the Boldino Autumn." Coincidentally, the completion of this book also owes to the relative leisure brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Etymologically, "involution" is the antonym of "evolution," leading to the interpretation that involution signifies regression. Is this reasonable? Should competition not drive evolution? As previously discussed, a system evolves through functional differentiation enabled by cooperation among individuals, growing increasingly complex and ultimately achieving more profound Cooperative Ascension—this is genuine evolution. Excessive individual competition, which leads to internal depletion or "Law of Grabbing Deficit," necessarily obstructs such evolution and may even cause regression. [Thus, involution often serves as a prelude and trigger to the regression of complex cooperative systems.]()  

[Therefore, when people discuss involution—excessive competition leading to "Law of Grabbing Deficit"—it is by no means an excuse for fearing competition. Instead, involution inflicts tangible, large-scale harm on human cooperation. In the section comparing humans and ants, we emphasized the unique significance of competition for human evolution and progress: it is precisely because humans embrace competition that we have achieved rapid advancement surpassing other species. However, excess is as harmful as insufficiency; while embracing competition, we must remain vigilant against all covert factors that may breed involution.]()  

That said, "lying flat" is hardly an active response to involution. It more closely resembles an excuse for "Free-Riderism" and a classic grabbing behavior. The genuine solution to involution lies in re-evolution: re-establishing cooperation, engaging in scientific competition, and avoiding internal depletion. This requires both improvements in the broader environment and upgrades in institutional systems, as well as corresponding awareness and ideological consciousness among all participating individuals. In this regard, the *Zhou Rituals*'s advocacy for "[When music reaches its perfection, there is no resentment; when ritual reaches its perfection, there is no contention]()" deserves our deep reflection.
