# Evolution of Justice: The Pendulum Effect of Cooperation and Competition【★★★】  
Readers may have already noticed that within the context of this book, "Virtue" and "Justice" are nearly synonymous concepts. Indeed, throughout history, across all time and space, people have unremittingly pursued more accurate interpretations of "Virtue" and "Justice." Broadly speaking, we can categorize conceptions of Justice into two ideological trends: one centered on Cooperation, i.e., the trend of Collectivism; and the other centered on Competition, i.e., the trend of Individualism. Most of the time, the Cooperative trend dominates, given that humanity has long entered the Fourth Dimension. However, in reality, human society more often swings between these two. Injustices and conflicts between individuals, along with unscrupulous individuals gaining power, cause the pendulum to swing from the right (Competition) to the left; as conflicts escalate, society fragments, and wars persist, the pendulum then swings back from the left to the right. I refer to this phenomenon as the Pendulum Effect of Cooperation and Competition.

| Social Ideological Trends | Interpretations of Justice |  
|--|--|  
| Vedic Religion, Brahmanism, Buddhism (Cooperation) | Karma (retribution for good and evil deeds); division of labor and cooperation |  
| Confucianism (Cooperation) | Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and integrity; "do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire" |  
| Legalism (Competition) | Clear rewards and punishments; laws, tactics, and authority to control people |  
| Plato, Aristotle (Cooperation) | *The Republic* (division of labor, cooperation, and each adhering to their roles) |  
| *The Prince* (Competition) | Human nature is inherently evil; it should be constrained and utilized |  
| Christianity (Cooperation) | The Ten Commandments; belief in original sin, belief in salvation, belief in the end times |  
| The Renaissance (Competition) | Humanism; emphasizing the value of humanity |  
| The French Revolution (Cooperation) | Democracy, freedom, equality |  
| Capitalism (Competition) | Rule of law; inviolability of private property |  
| Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Cooperation) | Human rights |  
| Socialism, Communism (Cooperation) | Distribution according to need; common prosperity |

For example, Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, and moral principles, inheriting the Cooperative ideological trend of the Rites of Zhou. However, moral rules inadequately constrain grabbing individuals, making it difficult to be self-consistent, leading to repeated setbacks during the chaotic Warring States period. Ultimately, in the harsh reality, it evolved into Legalism, which emphasizes clear rewards and punishments, severe laws, and harsh penalties. Its essence lies in emphasizing Competition, using Competition to eliminate corruption and revitalize society, achieving excellent results initially. However, when Competition becomes excessive, intense, and grabbing-oriented, everyone feels threatened, and everyone becomes an enemy to everyone else, ultimately undermining the foundation of Cooperation and collapsing without external attack.  

Another example is Christianity, which emphasizes moral principles such as righteousness, loving others, charity, loving one's enemies, fasting, not loving wealth, not judging others, and sincerity without deception—this is a quintessential Cooperative ideological trend (analogous to ant philosophy, lacking only the genetic suppression mechanism). However, Christianity, similar to other Cooperative-oriented ideological trends, neglects the importance of Competition and the individual. Ultimately, individual value is suppressed; excellent individuals who cooperate gain no genetic advantage, while free-riders and grabbing individuals face no genetic disadvantage, ultimately harming Cooperation itself.  

The Renaissance, however, rediscovered the value of humanity, thereby liberating productivity and creativity. People often re-recognize the importance of the individual and Competition (as in the Renaissance) when Cooperation leads to internal corruption that is difficult to eliminate (as with Christianity). Then, when involution and struggles reach the point of mutual annihilation (as in Capitalism, a "man-eat-man" system), they finally re-remember the importance of Cooperation, which is then once again promoted to the extreme (as in Soviet-style Socialism). Issues such as egalitarian distribution, free-riders, and internal corruption once again cause the capacity of the Cooperative entity to decline, leading to its disintegration from within.  

[In fact, both Cooperation and Competition are important, yet both have boundaries—excess is as bad as deficiency. Excessive Cooperation easily degenerates into indulgent niceness, providing a breeding ground for free-riders and fertile ground for the proliferation of grabbing individuals, while also making it difficult to eliminate inherent hypocritical elements. Ultimately, as one grows while the other shrinks, Cooperation itself is harmed, leading to rot from within. Excessive Competition, on the other hand, easily evolves into short-sightedness, involution, and grabbing orientation—especially if Competition solely emphasizes individual ability while neglecting Cooperative capacity—ultimately harming Cooperation as well. Misunderstanding Cooperation or Misunderstanding Competition can both lead to extremely adverse outcomes.]()  

Writing to this point, I cannot help but recall once more Rome's Golden Age and the admirable Scipio family. Scipio Africanus demonstrated genius-level military prowess during his campaigns against Carthage and defeating Hannibal, as well as the military strength of the Roman army he trained, which far exceeded that of neighboring states. However, his foreign policy was remarkably moderate, maintaining great tolerance toward the defeated—whether Phoenicia, Numidia, Greek city-states, or Macedonia.  

The Romans under his leadership respected powerful adversaries, dared to face challenges, boldly learned from their adversaries, and discovered the shining points and unique characteristics of other civilizations, appreciating one another. At the same time, they did not fear Competition, using it to temper themselves and improve—they seemed to understand that competition with other civilizations was the driving force to maintain internal vitality and progress of their own civilization. In broader terms, they dedicated themselves to building a Cooperative community of civilizations, striving to enable each civilization to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes within it. Both Competition and Cooperation were almost perfectly balanced.  

However, this beautiful balance gradually dissipated with the burning of Carthage. The perceptive Scipio Aemilianus, witnessing this conflagration, seemed to glimpse Rome's future fate, and could not help but weep.  

There was a time when humanity, for the sake of Justice in their hearts, would incur harm upon themselves; when they would persevere indomitably; when they would maim their own eyes or sever their own arms. It is not that humanity lacks convictions or faith; rather, it is because throughout history, humanity has encountered too many setbacks, been subjected to too much intentional or unintentional exploitation, PUA (Pick-Up Artist tactics), and moral coercion. Humanity has also often been maliciously led astray or obstructed by base means, even when starting from the perspective of Virtue and Justice, ultimately leading to numerous tragedies.  

By now, it has become difficult for people to discern: what is true Justice; what are means of Justice that fail to achieve desired outcomes; what are attempts to achieve just ends through unjust means; and what are evil deeds carried out under the pretense of Justice. It is hoped that the theoretical tool of Adversarial Evolution will help humanity distinguish right from wrong and clear mental obstacles. As the pendulum's swing becomes increasingly smaller, I believe that humanity will one day find this beautiful balance point.
