# The Meaning and Mission of Human Existence【★★★★★】  
On the surface, humanity in the 21st century understands itself and the surrounding world more deeply than in any previous century. The significant advancement of science and technology has enabled humans to gain increasingly profound insights into their own physiological structures and even psychological mechanisms, as well as to master and manipulate the natural environment and material world around them. Yet humanity's sense of anxiety has not diminished; rather, it has grown. This anxiety stems not only from the pressures of life and work but, more fundamentally, from the "absence" of meaning in life and human existence. This is particularly evident in an era where theology, religion, and imperial authority have all crumbled. Such a state leaves humans perpetually in doubt—doubting life, doubting others, and doubting themselves. This collapse and skepticism have been further intensified by the theories of *The Origin of Species* and *The Selfish Gene*. Modern evolutionary psychology likens the human psyche to a "hedonic treadmill," as if the pursuit of immediate pleasure, its swift dissipation, and the subsequent chase for the next pleasure are the sole meaning bestowed upon humanity by its genes. "Pursuing freedom and happiness" and "living in the moment" represent an instinctive resistance to the loss of "meaning," but does this resistance hold up? Is it not somewhat short-sighted?  

What humanity has truly lost is the capacity for awe and the rationale to pursue "greatness"—a cause for which humans would sacrifice themselves and through which they have already achieved brilliant accomplishments. Past "greatness" can almost all be deemed false, or even interpreted as a "conspiracy" of selfish genes. Humanity's confidence has been dealt an unprecedented blow. However, this book reveals another dimension of the meaning of "existence," or rather, the true essence of "selfish genes" and "biological evolution."  

[I exist, therefore I think!]()  

Precisely because we exist, we have the opportunity to think; if an idea is "correct" or "immortal," then the genes of the thinking subject will also be "immortal."  

[Genetic strategies that do not contribute to the long-term survival of genes, the individuals shaped by such genes, and the "ways of thinking" of these individuals will all be eliminated. This is the underlying logic of evolution.]()  

How, then, can a gene achieve "immortal survival"?  

[Mad replication is a clumsy and short-sighted method; the truly astute means of selfish genes lies in "ordering."]()

For the more stable and controllable the environment, the more conducive it is to the long-term survival of genes and the generation of cooperative dividends. In theory, if a single individual exists infinitely stably, its genes would be "extremely successful"—far more astute than those genes that frantically replicate, plunder resources, then engage in grabbing conflicts, mutual destruction, and eventual collective extinction. Thus, the astute and far-sighted selfish genes truly pursue life forms characterized by [Self-Consistency, Robustness, Self-Repairability, Sustainability](). The foresightedness of genes is often manifested in how they establish mechanisms to avoid "grabbing" and sustain "cooperation." Many examples of this have been summarized earlier, so they need not be repeated here.  

[Foresightedness is precisely the common characteristic exhibited by all these mechanisms.]()  

In the end, the life communities that survive and achieve immortal existence must be maximally self-consistent. They cannot grab from the outside, cannot allow external environmental entropy to increase indefinitely, and must avoid destabilizing factors; nor can they grab from future generations, so as to avoid reducing sustainability.  

[Continuously ascending through cooperation and releasing cooperative dividends is almost the optimal choice.]()  

Genetic strategies lacking self-consistency will ultimately be eliminated, making way for the birth of the next life community with more sophisticated mechanisms. Among all known life forms in the known universe, humanity is the life form at the forefront of this path toward self-consistency and immortality. Most life forms cooperate only to better grab, yet humanity has already glimpsed the necessity of self-consistency in the life world. The shift from cooperative grabbing to cooperative self-consistency marks a qualitative leap in life's awakening. Though human history is short, judging from the miracles humanity has already created, it is undoubtedly the species most likely to fulfill this grand ambition at present. All life on Earth has ceded as much evolutionary space as possible to humanity to accomplish this feat. To advance further, humanity must also regard the entire Earth as a symbiotic living whole.  

Humans, standing at the crest of this wave, deserve—and must possess—sufficient pride, mission, and responsibility. Even amid setbacks and regressions, humanity has at times touched unprecedented heights. Love is great and genuine; tales of chivalry and righteousness are not fictional; the motivation to sacrifice for others is pure; mutual trust between people is possible; individuals can harbor ideals and pursue poetry and distant horizons; people of different skin colors and ethnicities can coexist harmoniously; individuals of different species, genes, and traits can show compassion for one another, fulfill one another, and blend into the world in harmony.  

The meaning of humanity and human life, in essence, lies in this: when you find the truly correct meaning (if it exists) and strive for it, your genes and their meaning will be immortal—while all other genes and meanings will vanish entirely along the vast timeline of evolution. That is all.
