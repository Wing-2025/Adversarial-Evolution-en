# Group X-ism – Group Grabbingism  
Just as individual organisms follow evolutionary patterns, groups also exhibit similar dynamics, with tendencies toward either grabbing resources or cooperating. This gives rise to various group-level strategies: Group Grabbingism, Group Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, and Group Hypocrisyism. Collectively, I refer to these as "Group X-ism." Let us now systematically analyze the intriguing phenomena these game strategies generate when applied to groups.  

## The Dark Forest Theory – All Civilizations Are Enemies of All Civilizations 【★】  
Liu Cixin’s *The Three-Body Problem* introduces the famous Dark Forest Theory: the universe is a dark forest, where every civilization is an armed hunter, moving stealthily like a ghost. They part branches quietly, suppress their footsteps, and even control their breath—for they must be cautious. The forest teems with hunters like them, and if a hunter discovers another life, their only option is to shoot to eliminate it. In this forest, others are hell, eternal threats; any life that reveals its existence will soon be eradicated. This is the portrait of cosmic civilizations.  

In essence, the logic of civilizational conflict described by Liu Cixin represents the ultimate form of group conflict and Group Grabbingism.

Similar to individual competition, group grabbing behavior is also the most easily evolved, becoming a frequent occurrence in natural selection in the narrow sense. We often denounce the inhumanity of tyrannical monarchs and military leaders, yet history shows that monarchs who exhibit mercy toward foreign states are often eliminated. As the adage goes, "Mercy does not command armies; virtue does not govern politics." This is a cold and unavoidable reality. Just as the animal kingdom, before the emergence of Tit-for-Tat and Virtue-Upholding mechanisms, existed in a Hobbesian Jungle of the strong preying on the weak, where everyone is an enemy to everyone else, so too does the same principle, when applied to group competition, give rise to a more terrifying "Group Hobbesian Jungle"—where every "group" is an enemy to every other "group."

As Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century British Prime Minister, once stated, "There are no eternal friends between nations, only eternal interests." Historical examples of nations gaining enormous benefits through grabbing abound: from the State of Qin’s militarism in Chinese history, which enabled unprecedented military mobilization and ultimately led to the unification of the six states, to modern colonial powers that plundered vast resources through wars of conquest. Like individual grabbingism, Group Grabbingism can be described using contemporary terms: it is inter-group involution, inter-group internal friction, and an arms race.  

## Militarism: A Typical Group Grabbing Behavior  
If groups were to cooperate and reciprocate absolutely, armies would serve little purpose. Developing military forces for self-defense is understandable, but militarism—where a nation devotes its entire strength to military expansion, adopts aggressive conquest as its foundational policy, and subordinates politics, economy, culture, and education to military preparedness and foreign wars—is fundamentally different. This is a quintessential form of inter-group grabbing behavior.  

In human history, nations and polities that have adopted such policies are not uncommon. Like individual grabbing behavior, they often gain significant short-term advantages. Prominent examples include the State of Qin, the Assyrian Empire, Sparta, the Teutonic Knights, the Kingdom of Prussia, Nazi Germany, and the Japanese Empire.  

### The State of Qin in the Late Warring States Period  
Qin’s militaristic policy was structured as follows: Economically, Shang Yang abolished the slave-owning public land system and implemented a landlord-based private land system, allowing land transactions. While promoting iron tools and oxen to boost agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies, Qin adopted a "farming and warfare" strategy, reducing the populace to two states: fighting or preparing to fight. Shang Yang only encouraged two activities among the people: farming and warfare. The *Discourses on Salt and Iron* describes the hardship of the Qin people: "When Shang Yang governed Qin, executing people was as common as cutting grass, and waging war was as casual as shooting marbles." Under Shang Yang, Qin became a nation of soldiers and farmers, with all Qin people reduced to cogs in a war machine.  

Militarily, Qin’s laws required all men aged 17 to 60 to serve when conscripted. Families with two adult males were legally required to split. Qin’s military ranks were divided into 20 levels based on merit: a common soldier could be promoted by killing one enemy. *The Book of Lord Shang* states, "He who captures the head of an enemy officer shall be granted one rank, one hundred mu of land, nine mu of residential land, and one commoner to serve his household." A single enemy head translated to a rank, land, and free labor. Higher ranks required greater merit, which drastically incentivized Qin’s soldiers, transforming them into a "wolfish army." Historical records note, "The people celebrate at the news of war," for it meant opportunities for promotion and wealth. Society descended into a war frenzy: "The people view war as a starving wolf views meat."  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd784969-0775-4b17-acce-4ce46b0b96d3" />  
</p>  

Though culturally backward and politically brutal, the state structure established by Shang Yang was militarily highly effective. Qin functioned with unity, discipline, and obedience. At the king’s command, it surged like a beast toward its enemies, earning the name "the Wolfish State."  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eb972dd-8b8f-4785-b625-5544564017ee" />  
</p>  

Francis Fukuyama writes in *The Origins of Political Order*: "Compared to other militarized societies, China during the Zhou (Warring States) period was exceptionally brutal. One estimate suggests that Qin mobilized 8% to 20% of its total population, whereas the Roman Republic mobilized only 1%. Casualties at the end of the Zhou period were also unprecedented. The Roman Republic lost approximately 50,000 soldiers in the Battles of Lake Trasimene and Cannae (among the most famous wars in Western history), yet... Chinese numbers were nearly ten times that (e.g., the Battle of Changping)."  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545986dd-6d68-431c-8120-b0b42c273813" />  
</p>  

Those who compare Chinese and Western military histories share similar observations: what the West deems a "great war" is trivial by Eastern standards. Westerners should perhaps thank the Legalists, Shang Yang, and Qin Shi Huang for not emerging in their lands, though this is not mere coincidence—it reflects deeper evolutionary patterns, which we will explore in the next volume.  

Is Group Grabbingism ultimately the winner? In the short term, like individual grabbingism, it often achieves temporary dominance, with one state conquering others. However, over longer historical periods, these regimes are generally losers. A review of the aforementioned examples of group-grabbing states reveals that few met favorable fates.  

## Group Grabbing Deficit  
Notably, similar to individual grabbing behavior, inter-group grabbing also incurs significant "grabbing deficit." In the Battle of Changping alone, the Qin army under Bai Qi beheaded and buried alive 400,000 Zhao soldiers (though exact figures remain debated, the losses were undeniably catastrophic). Some even claim that Zhao’s young men were nearly annihilated. Qin itself lost nearly 200,000 men. For a nation of several million, losing nearly 10% of its young male population in a single battle reflects a staggering grabbing deficit.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4588cc1-cf72-4ed0-a17f-96855963eb87" />  
</p>  

Though Qin conquered the six states, it accumulated profound resentment. The phrase "The world has long suffered under Qin" captures the sentiment of its people—felt not only by the conquered but also by the conquering Qin population itself. This illustrates that extreme Group Grabbingism leads to massive super-group deficit.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1402ed10-ef12-484c-8fc4-f3fc49b76068" />  
</p>  

## Other Forms of Grabbing and Super-Group Deficit  
Of course, direct militarism is not the only form of group grabbing. Like the grabbing behaviors in the animal kingdom discussed earlier, some group grabbing is more covert but still incurs group grabbing losses.  

### Qin’s Strategy to Conquer the Western Rong  
During the reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the state faced threats from the Western Rong, a neighboring ethnic group. The Western Rong had a capable leader, You Yu, who governed them prosperously. Duke Mu thus told his advisors: "I have heard that the presence of a sage in a neighboring state is a misfortune for its rival. Now, You Yu is talented—this is a calamity for our Qin. What should I do?"

### The Moral and Institutional Superiority of the Western Rong and the Strategy of Corruption  
The Western Rong indeed possessed a more virtuous moral and institutional framework compared to the State of Qin. However, the Rong were still in an early stage of civilizational development, having not yet tasted the "sweetness" of autocratic governance. The Qin's strategists, ever shrewd, proposed: "The Rong king is honest and benevolent, but this is only because he resides in a remote region, unaware of the indulgent lifestyles of our Central Plains. Your Majesty might present singing and dancing girls to the Rong king to corrupt his resolve. Additionally, we can request a delay in You Yu's return to Rong from the king, while detaining You Yu here to prolong his absence, thereby sowing discord between ruler and minister." This was a devious yet effective stratagem. Duke Mu of Qin instructed his advisors to present sixteen songstresses to the Rong king. The Rong king accepted the gift, became infatuated with it, and neglected state affairs. For an entire year, he refrained from moving his encampment or changing pastures, leading to the death of half his horses and cattle. Only then did Qin allow You Yu to return. You Yu repeatedly remonstrated with the Rong king, but the king, now enthralled by the Central Plains' royal luxuries, ignored his advice. Duke Mu of Qin sent secret envoys to court You Yu, who eventually defected to Qin. Treated with great respect as a guest, You Yu provided extensive intelligence on the Western Rong. In 623 BCE, Qin, employing You Yu's strategies, conquered the Western Rong. This tactic of corrupting foreign tribes, sowing division, and reducing the enemy's *Group Cooperation Degree*—rather than enhancing one's own cooperative capacity—exemplifies *Group Grabbingism*.

### How Liu Bang Defeated Xiang Yu? [Optional Reading]  
Perhaps no one mastered this art better than Liu Bang, whose victory over Xiang Yu relied heavily on bribery. By offering high offices and rich rewards, Liu Bang co-opted military opportunists from both his own and the enemy camps. Peng Yue, a former bandit who participated in the rebellion against Qin, received no significant rewards after Xiang Yu divided the realm. Liu Bang granted him a general’s seal, ordering him to attack Xiang Yu’s vassal states from the flanks, and later promised him the title of King of Wei. Ying Bu, a former convict who rose to command Xiang Yu’s elite forces at the Battle of Julu, was lured by Liu Bang’s envoys with the promise of land and the title of King of Huainan, inciting his defection. Though Liu Bang held these men in private disdain—maintaining his brash, unrefined demeanor—this approach proved effective for attracting unscrupulous opportunists. When Ying Bu, defeated by Xiang Yu, fled to Liu Bang, he found Liu sitting on his bed washing his feet while summoning him, a display of overt disrespect that enraged Ying and left him contemplating suicide. Yet when he was shown to a residence furnished with luxurious drapes, fine utensils, sumptuous meals, and attendants, his anger turned to elation.  

After seizing power through such tactics, Liu Bang infamously discarded these allies: none met a good end. Han Xin (King of Qi), Han Xin (King of Han), Peng Yue (King of Liang), and Ying Bu (King of Huainan) were all eliminated. Liu Bang excelled in the "chaotic dilemma game," using advanced PUA-like manipulation, ditching allies after use, and reclaiming benefits. His strategy of dividing adversaries through利诱 (material inducement) and betrayal—rather than competing fairly based on collective strength—also qualifies as *Group Grabbingism*.

### Group Grabbingism as an Easily Evolved Tendency  
To explain this, we examine two angles: the fates of benevolent group leaders and their communities, and how originally cooperative group ethos degenerates into *Group Grabbingism*.  

#### The Cost of King Fuchai’s Mercy in Sparing Yue  
When King Fuchai of Wu defeated Yue, his subconscious remained bound by the ritual norms of Spring and Autumn warfare: once an enemy submits, annihilation is unnecessary. Wu Zixu remonstrated: "Wu and Yue are mortal enemies, surrounded by the Three Rivers with no room for their peoples to migrate. One must perish for the other to survive—this cannot change. I have heard: land dwellers stay on land, water dwellers stay on water. For states north of the mountains, even if we conquer them, we cannot occupy their lands or use their chariots. But Yue—if we conquer it, we can occupy its lands and use its boats. This opportunity must not be missed! If we do, even regret will come too late." Wu Zixu urged total conquest, arguing that Wu and Yue were too similar and proximate to coexist. Perhaps out of adherence to Zhou’s "no-annihilation" rules or to spare his troops further sacrifice, Fuchai’s mercy spared Yue, only to pay with Wu’s destruction. Yue, through decades of "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall" (enduring hardship to rebuild), hid soldiers among the people, and—taking advantage of Wu’s depleted strength from northern campaigns—surged to annihilate Wu. The benevolent Fuchai was defeated by Yue, which flouted Spring and Autumn war ethics by launching a surprise attack. Here, *Group Grabbingism* triumphed, and benevolence was eliminated—a harsh evolutionary logic mirroring pre-*Virtue Selection* individual evolution.  

In later years, Gou Jian’s moral character proved questionable. After becoming overlord, his diligence waned, and his paranoia grew. Fan Li, a key advisor who served him loyally for two decades, saw through his nature—"fit only for shared hardship, not shared prosperity"—and fled into obscurity. Wen Zhong, another minister, was less fortunate: accused of "plotting rebellion," he was forced to commit suicide with a sword. After Gou Jian’s death, Yue descended into chaos with three regicides ("the Yue thrice assassinated their kings"), further weakened by defeats against Chu, and eventually annexed.  

A note on historical records: accounts often distort truth. For instance, the *Guoyu* (Discourses of the States) portrays Fuchai as a decadent fool, seduced by Yue’s beauties and slander. Yet recently unearthed Warring States bamboo slips, *Yue Gong Qi Shi* (Affairs of Lord Yue), reveal a more nuanced Fuchai: he accepted peace talks due to Wu’s distant, costly campaign, addressing Yue’s envoys humbly: "...I have offended; my unworthy border officials stoked resentment, fomenting strife between Wu and Yue... I wish to meet Lord Yue, to abandon enmity and restore amity, seeking blessings from above and below... I, in fear, braved weapons to prostrate myself before you... How dare I refuse Lord Yue’s wishes?" This Fuchai, adhering to Spring and Autumn traditions, acted with ritual propriety, yet his defeat led to rumors exaggerating his vices—perpetuating the "success=virtue, failure=vice" fallacy, which distorts both history and morality. As emphasized earlier, from an *Adversarial Evolution* perspective, without *Virtue Selection*, morality not only fails to enhance fitness but reduces it—for individuals and groups alike. This is the tragic core of Confucianism: moral states could not survive in an era lacking mechanisms to punish immorality and expose hypocrisy. The masses had yet to grasp the gravity of evolutionary crises. Thus, *Group Grabbingism*, like individual grabbingism, is an *easily evolved tendency*.

### The Distortion of Bushido: The Group Grabbingization of Collectivism  
Bushido, as previously noted, traces its origins to universal human *Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism*. Japan uses cherry blossoms to metaphorize Bushido: individual blossoms are beautiful, but a collective bloom is more splendid—mirroring the samurai’s collective spirit. Yet the Japanese regard cherry blossoms’ peak beauty not in full bloom, but in their fleeting fall: entire mountains of blossoms wilting overnight, none clinging to branches. This symbolizes the samurai’s ethos: achieving life’s pinnacle in a moment of brilliance, valuing self-sacrifice over survival.  

From many angles, Bushido inspires reverence. Only within the *Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution* framework, however, do its contradictions, dilemmas, and paradoxes emerge. When Bushido evolves into blind devotion to a lord or state—prioritizing collectivism and sacrifice over justice—it degenerates into *Group Grabbingism*. Whereas ordinary people cling to life, Bushido negates it, viewing death as the only truth and worldly gains as illusions. To "abandon one’s life" becomes a moral imperative, enabling one to "take others’ lives." This "disregard for one’s own life" is inseparable from "disregard for others’ lives"—the moral code by which samurai claimed superiority.  

<p align="center">

</p>

For instance, Naoshige, the founder of the Saga Nabeshima Domain, once told his son Katsushige, "To make decapitation a common practice, you must first decapitate the executioner." Thus, within the Western Magistrate's Office, ten men were lined up for him to practice beheading. Katsushige decapitated nine in succession. When he reached the tenth, a robust young man, he said, "I have decapitated enough; let that one live." This young man was spared. The cruel "100-head decapitation contest" by Japanese soldiers during their invasion of China—a chilling example—can be traced to such origins. Collectivism easily distorts into *Group Grabbingism* because groups that practice grabbing inherently possess higher generalized fitness than non-grabbing groups, a result of "survival of the fittest." Even though individuals within these groups still benefit from reciprocal cooperation; even though they believe in justice and punish grabbing when interacting internally, when engaging with other groups, especially for decision-makers, adhering to grabbingism remains their optimal strategy. Consequently, individuals within such groups are riddled with contradictions—even split personalities: empathetic, fair, and just internally, yet cold-blooded, aggressive, exploitative, and grabbing externally. Under real-world conditions, only groups that master both sides of this duality can be truly powerful. Yet even such groups are precarious, for grabbing knows no bounds. There will always emerge enemies more ruthless and unconstrained, and as grabbing methods escalate, the *Law of Grabbing Deficit* (1+1<2) will inevitably intensify. In this Hobbesian Jungle where "every group is the enemy of every group," there are rarely final winners.  

Unlike individual grabbing, humanity’s *Virtue Selection* mechanism has largely purged inner evil, with fragments of virtue etched into our genes. However, *Group Grabbingism*—rooted in collectivism—has become a key driver of success for certain ethnic groups and communities. Lacking a "group-level Virtue Selection" mechanism to eliminate it, this tendency becomes ingrained in human genes, resisting erasure. Take racial discrimination: people may struggle to act cruelly toward those of the same origin but readily transform into demons against other ethnicities.  

### The Profound Impact of Group Grabbingism [★]  
Group grabbing can be disguised as a rational group behavior—objectively choosing the optimal strategy for one’s group’s interests, seemingly justifiable. Yet beyond causing massive intergroup grabbing deficits, its long-term internal effects are equally deleterious. While humans easily unite for shared justice, they also readily coalesce around shared grabbing goals. This is a matter of degree, and without ethical constraints or theoretical frameworks, this degree is difficult to manage. Amidst hypocrisy and ambiguities, the collective force of group self-interest often pushes toward deeper grabbing. Hence, the "tyranny of the majority" recurs in history—a fundamental reason democracy fails to resolve many issues. Even introspective wise men, lacking intellectual tools or foundational arguments, struggle to persuade fervent masses. Thus, the tendency toward group grabbing is a deep-seated cause of malicious thoughts and actions ultimately backfiring on the group itself.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7df9ca3-aa16-401f-8c03-2c04a4e49fc8" /></p>  

As seen in the examples above, people abandon personal morality for group grabbing. For instance, securing group victory through bribes, defection, pardoning schemers, or recruiting disloyal individuals forces personal morality to degrade. Moreover, group grabbing necessitates selecting decision-making teams and ruling classes inclined toward grabbing, who typically gain genetic advantages. Thus, royal and noble families are often the first to corrupt within a group, propagating their grabbing-oriented genetic strategies downward, leading to severe internal friction. Groups composed purely of virtue-upholding, evil-rejecting individuals are less prone to group grabbing but may not triumph in intense intergroup struggles. Group grabbingism is a flaw beyond humanity’s individual-level Virtue Selection mechanism—another major "bug" alongside hypocrisyism. It will emerge as a new challenge on life’s path toward *Cooperative Ascension*. This book’s second volume will revisit group grabbingism extensively.  

## The Flaws in the Dark Forest Theory [Optional Reading] [★]  
The "Dark Forest" logic from Liu Cixin’s works, mentioned earlier, is the ultimate form of intergroup conflict and *Group Grabbingism*. Though the tendency toward group grabbing arises from multiple evolutionary pressures, it seems an inevitable end to group games—much like how "selfish genes" were once thought to inherently produce selfish behavior, and "Dark Forest" or "Hobbesian Jungle" was seen as the final form of interstellar civilization conflict. The specter of "evolutionism" looms here, with the Dark Forest Theory aligning with evolutionism’s "survival of the fittest" narrative—a cold but seemingly unavoidable conclusion, akin to the "selfish gene" hypothesis.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baa63981-86a1-4ca4-a9fb-28f36458fa44" /></p>  

Yet a critical logical flaw exists: what are the origins and foundational pillars of "civilization"? If civilizations adhering to Dark Forest logic cannot even sustain themselves—or fail to "emerge" in the first place—would the ultimate form of interstellar civilization still be the Hobbesian Jungle of the Dark Forest? Proving this is not difficult. Using reductio ad absurdum: if we accept the Dark Forest axiom—"all civilizations are enemies of all civilizations"—then this must apply to races, nations, and families within a civilization. The result would be constant infighting and mutual annihilation among these subgroups. We know that conflicts between civilizations of similar rank are devastating—destruction is easier than construction; entropy increases more readily than decreases—less advanced civilizations may wield destructive power exceeding the defensive and constructive capacities of more advanced ones (consider, for example, why the U.S. fears far less developed North Korea). Such infighting would severely weaken these civilizations, either destroying them or stunting their development. Could they still be "advanced" civilizations?  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d9b094-d804-4bef-bcb4-b63a6843efef" /></p>  

Some may argue that the Dark Forest Theory assumes internal unity—no infighting within a civilization. Indeed, Liu Cixin’s theory is built on two axioms: 1. Survival is the most fundamental need of civilizations; 2. Civilizations grow and expand endlessly, yet the universe’s total matter is finite. Key concepts include: 1. *Chain of Suspicion*: mutual distrust between civilizations; 2. *Technological Explosion*: civilizations may rapidly leapfrog others in development. Applying these axioms to any nation, family, or ethnic group holds true. For instance, Legalists argued, "If even one’s wife and children cannot be trusted, then no one else can be." If spouses and kin are untrustworthy, how much more so foreigners? Thus, accepting the Dark Forest axiom makes it hard to exclude finer-grained groups from its logic. Under such a survival law, civilizational internal friction becomes severe, ultimately limiting development and preventing advancement to higher stages.  

Furthermore, as previously discussed, *cooperation and division of labor* are the primary drivers of productivity, not technology alone. A "technological explosion" in a weak civilization is not instantaneous—it requires prerequisites. These prerequisites—cooperation and division of labor—directly contradict the Dark Forest logic. The *Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model* reveals that intergroup competition occurs across multiple layers. Suppose the Milky Way hosts many civilizations, including those at Earth’s level. If humanity employs ruthless *Group Grabbingism* to dominate the galaxy through endless wars, the inevitable *Law of Grabbing Deficit* would slow the "galactic civilization’s" overall development. Compared to a civilization elsewhere in the universe that has evolved higher levels of mutual cooperation, the Milky Way’s civilization would remain at a lower dimensional stage. When challenging this higher-cooperation, higher-dimensional civilization, the Milky Way’s civilization would face *Dimensional Collapse*. In short, civilizations adhering to *Group Grabbingism* have already forfeited the conditions to ascend to higher dimensions.

If this higher-dimensional civilization deems Earth's civilization to possess both the awareness and potential to advance to the next dimension, it may choose to preserve and cooperate with Earth's civilization—for the more advanced a civilization, the deeper its understanding of cooperation and its preciousness. Conversely, if the higher-dimensional civilization discovers that the "Galactic Civilization" is utterly dominated by Group Grabbingism, it will likely activate its higher-dimensional "Virtue Selection" mechanism. It may take calculated risks to eliminate the "Galactic Civilization," which could potentially threaten cosmic harmony in the future. One may observe that, based on the theoretical deductions of this book, we arrive at a conclusion diametrically opposed to the "Dark Forest Theory." Civilizations adhering to Group Grabbingism are inherently incapable of long-term sustainability or genuine prosperity; they can only struggle within lower-dimensional states. Group Grabbingism more often manifests during the degenerative phases of higher-dimensional civilizations.  

The Dark Forest Theory may apply to a limited, chaotic period marked by disrupted order and内卷化 (involution) among ultra-high-dimensional civilizations, but it will never represent the norm. Within the super-group (the Galactic Civilization), can we evolve into a civilization with a higher degree of mutual cooperation? If we transcend the mental fetters of the "Altruism Paradox" and the "logic of the strong preying on the weak," and expand our intellectual horizons, we can certainly conceive of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism model grounded in the "genetic-behavioral strategy selection" framework. This model successfully forged human civilization, endowing humanity with wisdom and technology. Can it be further extended to inter-group adversarial games, thereby initiating a cosmic-level civilization? Has Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism ever existed in history? We will explore this in the next section.
