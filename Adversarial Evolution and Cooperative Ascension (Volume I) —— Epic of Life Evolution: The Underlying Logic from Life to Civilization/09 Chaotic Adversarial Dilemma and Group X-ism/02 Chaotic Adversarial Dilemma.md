# Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma  
The Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma is highly analogous to adversarial games between individuals. When a group interacts with other groups, it also faces strategic choices: it may adopt a mutually cooperative attitude, engage in grabbing behavior, or employ a tit-for-tat strategy. Generally, if a group (e.g., a family) adopts a cooperative strategy toward other groups, the super-group above it (e.g., a state) will gain cooperative dividends, which benefits the enhancement of the super-group’s strength. However, since cooperation requires altruism, and altruism can be exploited by grabbingists and Free-Riderists, it may harm the group’s own interests—especially when the other party does not adopt a mutually cooperative strategy—putting the cooperative group under pressure of elimination. Conversely, if a group (e.g., a family) adopts a grabbing strategy toward other groups, the group itself may grow stronger and squeeze out other groups. However, their grabbing behavior will incur losses as per the Law of Grabbing Deficit, weakening the strength of the super-group at the higher level (e.g., a state) and subjecting it to elimination pressure. This pressure, however, manifests more slowly compared to the elimination pressure faced by lower-level groups. Thus, human evolution enters a chaotic and intractable adversarial game state where optimal solutions are difficult to seek—what I term the [Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma]().  

## The Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma as a Selection Dilemma Under the Hierarchical Adversarial Model 【★】  
Let us further elaborate on the core issues within the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma. At each hierarchical level, we can simplify the situation by considering small groups engaging in "individualized" adversarial evolution. For each "individual" group, it can generally adopt two strategies: a grabbing-oriented (hawkish) strategy or a cooperative-oriented (dovish) strategy. If they lean toward grabbing, they will likely gain short-term benefits for their "individual" group; however, the super-group at the higher level will incur losses due to their grabbing behavior, reducing the super-group’s fitness. Even the long-term interests of the hawkish small group will be harmed. Yet, without the establishment of mechanisms to maintain cooperation, such "short-sighted genes" will always evolve. If they are willing to cede some interests (through altruism) to establish and maintain cooperative relationships, they will quickly suffer disadvantages when facing hawkish groups. This disadvantage will erode them day by day and month by month, eventually leading to the elimination of the cooperative group. Therefore, for the "individual" within the larger group (which may be a medium or small group), whether it chooses grabbing or cooperation, it faces the possibility of elimination. Moreover, the solution space for this optimal strategy is highly chaotic; any unknown factor can trigger unpredictable butterfly effects. Every decision made by an "individual" or group in this game may influence the final outcome, which in most cases results in a multi-loss scenario—because at every level, some extremely grabbing individuals (or groups) will emerge, and this cannot be avoided without the formation of stable and precise mechanisms to punish grabbing behavior.  

Under the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma, Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) states are nearly nonexistent. From super-groups down to each group at every level, and even to each individual at the base level, no single choice can lead them into an evolutionarily stable state of ESS. If you choose grabbing, you may enjoy temporary gains, but your super-group will be weakened, potentially leading to the elimination of the entire group. If you choose cooperation, neighboring individuals will seize opportunities to deceive you and take advantage of you; once they grow strong enough, they will turn to seize your interests until you are eliminated. Even if you choose tit-for-tat or the more advanced Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, you may still be deceived by Hypocrisyism and face elimination risks. This "you" can represent various entities: an individual, a department, a company, a political party, a country, or an ethnic group.

In comparison, the Prisoner’s Dilemma is solvable, whereas the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma is nearly unsolvable (the only potential solution will be discussed in the next volume). That humans, once approaching a state akin to divinity, have faltered before this law is an honorable defeat. Perhaps only by understanding the intractability of this dilemma can we appreciate how arduous the journey of human development has been and recognize the greatness of humanity. Throughout history, some of the most eminent statesmen and strategists have attempted to seek what they perceived as optimal solutions within the complex solution space of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma. Yet, their efforts often backfire, with success and failure shifting in an instant. Chaotic outcomes, conflicting choices, clashes between short-sightedness and foresight, divergence between survival and ideals, and struggles between reason and human nature are the most common predicaments in this chaotic adversarial game.  

## Examples of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma  
Upon closer examination, cases of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma permeate all aspects of human historical events—from large-scale national conflicts and partisan struggles to minor family disputes. Here, I will use one historical episode as an example.  

### Why Multiple Campaigns to Attack Qin Seldom Succeeded  
In the late Warring States period, the State of Qin grew dominant, threatening to annex the six other states. Moreover, Qin disregarded the Rites of Zhou and often acted outrageously. Thus, the six states could not remain passive and launched multiple joint campaigns against Qin. If we consider the six states as a cooperative super-group, their combined strength far exceeded that of their "enemy," Qin. However, the six states harbored divergent and even malicious intentions, resulting in grabbingists within the alliance reaping benefits while cooperators were weakened. Under this loose and inefficient cooperative state, they failed to fundamentally defeat Qin; instead, Qin gradually broke the balance and eventually annihilated the six states.  

- **First Campaign to Attack Qin (318 BCE):** This year, Gongsun Yan, the prime minister of Wei, organized the "Five-State Campaign Against Qin," involving Wei, Chu, Zhao, Han, and Yan. Since Chu was the strongest among the five, King Huai of Chu was elected leader. However, only Wei, Zhao, and Han actually sent troops to engage Qin. The coalition advanced to Hangu Pass, where Qin counterattacked. Wei suffered significant losses and sent envoys to Chu to negotiate peace with Qin. Unexpectedly, Chu reached a peace agreement with Qin first, prompting the five-state alliance to withdraw in succession. The following year, Qin’s general Chuli Ji pursued and routed the Wei, Zhao, and Han forces, killing over 80,000 enemy soldiers. Why did Qi and Chu not participate? At the time, Qin, Chu, and Qi were the most powerful states. The alliance led by Chu posed a significant threat to Qi. Additionally, as a strong state, Chu was less urgent about attacking Qin than Wei, Zhao, and Han. Thus, Chu dispatched troops last and negotiated peace with Qin first, leaving the remaining three states to suffer heavy losses. Throughout this alliance, the six states schemed to let others fight while they profited.  

- **Second Campaign to Attack Qin (298 BCE):** This campaign, organized by Kuang Zhang, a general of Qi, involved Qi, Wei, and Han. After Lord Mengchang (Tian Wen) was mistreated in Qin, he returned to Qi as prime minister and initiated this joint attack. The campaign was successful: the coalition advanced to Hangu Pass, stationed troops there, and blockaded it. Three years later, they breached the pass, forcing Qin to seek peace. After Qin returned part of the territories to Han and Wei, the coalition withdrew. Though successful, the coalition failed to fundamentally weaken Qin due to Qin’s geographical advantages and Lord Mengchang’s primary motive of revenge.  

- **Third Campaign to Attack Qin (287 BCE):** In 287 BCE, under the persuasion of the renowned strategist Su Qin, King Min of Qi heeded his advice and allied with Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei to attack Qin. This coalition forced King Zhao of Qin to return parts of Wei and Zhao’s territories. However, King Min of Qi’s true goal was to invade the State of Song. After Qin ceded the territories, Qi launched a campaign to conquer Song. This move alarmed the other states, causing the third coalition to collapse. The result was that Yan, Qin, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Wei joined forces to attack Qi, capturing over seventy cities and reducing Qi to near destruction, with only Ju and Jimo remaining. Amid this chaotic evolution, Qin emerged as the greatest beneficiary.  

- **Fourth Campaign to Attack Qin (247 BCE):** This campaign was organized by Lord Xinling of Wei. The previous year, Qin’s general Meng Ao had been relentlessly attacking Wei, Zhao, and Han. King Anli of Wei hastily recalled Lord Xinling to lead the effort. Meanwhile, King Kaolie of Chu heeded Lord Chunshen’s anti-Qin strategy, and King Xiaocheng of Zhao followed Lord Jianxin’s advice to ally with Chu and Wei against Qin. Thus, a five-state coalition led by Chu, Zhao, and Wei was formed. In 247 BCE, Lord Xinling led the coalition to defeat Qin’s forces outside the Yellow River, forcing them to retreat to Hangu Pass. This alliance was driven by the decline of Zhao after the Battle of Changping, compelling the states to unite for the first time due to the existential crisis of national extinction. Though they achieved some success, they failed to persist and fundamentally shake Qin’s foundation. After a period of休整, Qin resumed its eastward expansion.  

- **Fifth Campaign to Attack Qin (241 BCE):** This marked the final vertical alliance of the Warring States era, led by General Pang Huan of the State of Zhao, uniting the allied forces of the five states: Chu, Zhao, Wei, Yan, and Han, in an attack against the State of Qin. The coalition pressed as far as Zui (northeast of present-day Lintong County, Shaanxi Province). However, when Qin counterattacked, the five-state alliance, unable to sustain the pressure, retreated. Later, Zhao even turned its forces against Qi, capturing Rao'an before withdrawing. Though Pang Huan’s command was unassailable, the power gap between Qin and the other states had long become insurmountable—even their combined strength was no match for Qin. It was destined that the vertical alliance could no longer reverse the fates of the six states toward annihilation.

From the war to annihilate Qin, we observe that had the six states fully embraced Mutualistic Cooperationism and maintained unwavering unity, defeating Qin would have been a natural outcome. Yet each state pursued its own narrow interests, failing to act in unison, and often engaging in internal strife and exploiting one another (internal Grabbingism). In this context, they faced a dual bind: act with greater moral clarity and renounce short-term gains, only to risk decline due to exploitation by other states; or pursue Grabbingism by seizing benefits from other states, which would damage and fragment the alliance, ultimately sealing their fate of subjugation by Qin. Thus, no choice guaranteed a favorable outcome.  

Su Xun, in his *Treatise on the Six States*, observed: *“The downfall of the six states was not due to inferior weaponry or poor combat skills; the flaw lay in their practice of ceding territory to Qin.”* The first half of this assertion holds true: initially, the combined strength of the six states far exceeded that of Qin, and they had ample moral justifications (or pretexts) to annihilate Qin. Yet their ultimate failure, though superficially attributed to “ceding territory to Qin,” stemmed from deeper internal disunity, trapping them in the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma.  

Peripheral states held an advantage here. The geographical environments of Qin, Chu, and Yan endowed them with the capacity to observe conflicts from a distance, capable of both offensive and defensive maneuvers—thus, it was no coincidence that the eventual victor emerged from these peripheral regions (a pattern where peripheral states historically dominate the Central Plains). The downfall of the six states cannot truly be attributed to them; even if one state had mastered the theory of Adversarial Evolution, it would still have been unavoidable. Only if all six states had deeply comprehended the theories of Adversarial Evolution and the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma could they have reversed their fates.  

Similar dilemmas of choice also emerged among different clans and factions within each feudal state—such as war hawks vs. peace advocates; diehards vs. reformists; conservatives vs. radicals. At the level of individual choice, the trajectory of Adversarial Evolution becomes even more unpredictable in its outcomes.  

### Further Examples of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma  
Take ancient Greece, home to over 200 city-states, with Athens and Sparta among the most powerful. During the Greco-Persian Wars, these city-states united to confront external threats. Yet once the wars concluded, each pursued its own narrow interests. Athens was not conquered by Persia or Macedonia but exhausted its strength in its rivalry with Sparta. Even internally, Athens lacked unity, with various factions emerging—such as Themistocles, a hero of the Greco-Persian Wars, and his opponents.  

Athens faced a dual dilemma: if it cooperated with Sparta against external foes, Sparta would rise to power and threaten Athens’ security; if it suppressed Sparta, then either Persia or Macedonia would exploit the situation to deliver a fatal blow. Confronted with this unsolvable challenge, Athens ultimately lost its political independence and democratic system.

This pattern manifests at all levels. Take partisan strife, for instance: in ancient China, many instances of partisan conflict inflicted fatal harm on both the populace and dynastic regimes. Often, the most shameless, unprincipled, Grabbingist, and Hypocrisyist tactics secured short-term victories—yet their triumphs simultaneously pushed the dynasty toward ruin and the people into dire suffering. Notorious figures like Zhao Gao, Yang Guozhong, Li Linfu, Qin Hui, and Wei Zhongxian ascended to the highest ranks by currying favor with emperors and suppressing rivals, achieving significant personal victories for themselves or their cliques. Yet the empires they served were plunged into massive crises due to their internal strife.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36eafcae-56a7-4c58-ba9a-8796b4606dcc" /></p>  

Within such a context, solutions are nearly nonexistent. Consider Yue Fei of the Southern Song Dynasty, who faced two choices: persist in the Northern Expedition to recover lost territories, or submit to the peace faction represented by Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui, accepting a slow decline toward national subjugation. Yue Fei chose the former, achieving successive victories in the Northern Expedition and nearing the point of marching on Bianjing to “restore the two emperors” (an outcome Emperor Gaozong sought to avoid). Yet he received twelve urgent imperial edicts within a single day, leading to the lament: *“A decade of efforts, wasted in an instant! All conquered territories, lost in a day!”*  

One choice for Yue Fei meant personal destruction but hope for the collective; the other meant personal survival but near hopelessness for the collective. For the Southern Song, both choices were nearly equivalent, as a Song without Yue Fei was already all but hopeless. Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui also faced a dual dilemma: if the two emperors were restored, Gaozong’s throne would be jeopardized (a reasonable speculation without historical corroboration); for Qin Hui, whether defying Gaozong or allowing Yue Fei to achieve unprecedented merits would undermine his own position.  

The “selfish genes” of Gaozong, Qin Hui, and Yue Fei all lacked optimal solutions. Yue Fei’s “selfish genes” were more astute and foresighted; he “understood” that safeguarding the collective’s interests—thereby protecting both the interests of closely related genes and his own genetic lineage—was a worthwhile trade, even at the cost of personal sacrifice. Gaozong and Qin Hui’s “selfish genes” were obtuse and short-sighted; they believed that preserving their lives would allow them to secure a corner of safety, yet ultimately, their actions led to the fragmentation of the realm, the suffering of hundreds of millions of genetically related compatriots, and their own violent deaths.  

The laws of evolution are cruel: among these selfish genes, the obtuse and short-sighted ones, in the absence of robust Virtue Selection, inevitably outcompete the astute and foresighted ones. Yue Fei could not rouse these two “pretending to sleep” individuals; thus, within this broader context, his tragedy was inevitable. Yet his integrity continues to inspire his nation and future generations, adding immense value to the cause of future revival—truly a “wise” expression of “selfish genes.” Such genes cannot help but evoke the lament: *“I would pour my heart into the zither, yet few understand; when the strings snap, who will listen?”*

Later generations often pass judgment on historical events and figures from a godlike perspective, drawing conclusions such as “this action was too radical,” “that was too weak,” “this was left-leaning,” “that was right-leaning”—as if replacing themselves with those ancient figures would allow them to reverse fates without regret. We often overlook an objective truth: in the face of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma, individual decisions are at times powerless, and the ideal of securing both short-term gains and long-term benefits is often an unsolvable puzzle.  

This new form of Adversarial Evolution, emerging from the advanced stages of group cooperation in the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma, lacks both genetic foundations and institutional preparedness in humanity; even human reason, for all its greatness, has yet to yield clear answers. A simplified description of the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma is that individuals within a super-group cannot find a behavioral path that necessarily benefits the long-term interests of both their immediate group and the super-group—no matter how strong their subjective aspirations or how willing they are to self-sacrifice.
