# Group X-ism – Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
Readers who have perused the preceding chapters should find it not difficult to grasp the concept of "Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism." Let us first recall Individual Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, which relies on a "Virtue Selection" mechanism. That is, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism practitioners engage in actions that reward virtue and punish evil, thereby altering the "natural" fitness of individuals. The ultimate goal is to achieve an evolutionarily stable state where virtuous individuals thrive and evil individuals are eliminated. Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism follows a similar logic, with the "Virtue Selection" mechanism further elevated to a "Group Virtue Selection" mechanism. It must be emphasized repeatedly here that [the "virtue and evil" referred to here are not those in the traditional sense](); for specific definitions, refer to the section "Adversarial Evolutionary Definition of Virtue."  

In fact, the "Dark Forest" state is also a form of queuing dilemma. On the surface, it seems unsolvable, but as discussed in previous chapters, the genetic behavioral strategy selection model represented by Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism provides a solution. This solution applies not only to individual adversarial evolutionary environments but also to group adversarial evolutionary environments. Suppose that advanced civilizations in the universe share the consensus to allow "virtuous" civilizations to flourish and eliminate "grabbing" civilizations; then, the cosmic super-group would have the opportunity to establish an ideal universal environment characterized by harmonious coexistence, rational competition, and the maximal release of cooperative dividends.  

The Group Virtue Selection mechanism is far more challenging to establish and realize than the individual Virtue Selection mechanism. Thus, "cosmic-level civilizations" ultimately compete based on the extent and thoroughness with which they establish the Group Virtue Selection mechanism. This "degree" essentially determines the technological level of a civilization. Civilizations unable to establish a Virtue Selection mechanism will never reach the stage of "technological explosion." For civilizations with weaker Virtue Selection mechanisms, rapid technological development will become a weapon to annihilate themselves when internal contradictions intensify—yielding more "living space" and "civilizational experimental fields" to civilizations with stronger Virtue Selection mechanisms.  

The cosmic perspective discussed in the Dark Forest is overly grand; let us return to the framework of human history for more concrete exploration. Has Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism ever existed in history?  

## Rites of Zhou – "For a long time now, I have not dreamt of the Duke of Zhou!"  
Let us begin with Confucius, a figure familiar to most. As a descendant of the royal family of the Shang Dynasty, Confucius dedicated his life to reviving the Rites of Zhou. He did not cling to his royal lineage or reminisce about his dynasty; instead, he was deeply fascinated by the rituals and music formulated by the Duke of Zhou, who overthrew his dynasty. The greatest joy for Confucius was dreaming of the Duke of Zhou, and in his later years, he expressed his melancholy by saying, "Alas, how I have aged! For a long time now, I have not dreamt of the Duke of Zhou." The greatest sorrow for him was the "collapse of rituals and decay of music." He spent his entire life traveling far and wide to revive the Rites of Zhou.  

What exactly were the Rites of Zhou that Confucius cherished so deeply? Why was he so infatuated with them? In the early years of the Zhou Dynasty, after the Duke of Zhou (Ji Dan) quelled internal rebellions and enfeoffed the nobles, he recognized that consolidating power required not only "military achievements" but also "cultural governance," hence the initiation of "formulating rituals and composing music." The "formulating rituals and composing music" involved institutionalizing the rights and obligations of various social strata through ritual and musical forms. This initiative covered a wide range of areas, including the system of primogeniture for inheriting the throne, the well-field system, penal systems, and musical systems, essentially encompassing all aspects of the state. The Duke of Zhou also established a series of strict ceremonial systems governing relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, and between kin and non-kin, as well as distinctions of honor and status, to regulate relations between the central court and local regions, and between nobles and subjects. This was the so-called ritual and musical system, with the classic text stating, "There are three hundred major rituals and three thousand minor rituals."  

### Were the Rites of Zhou merely feudal superstition and a tool of rulers?  
Many may perceive the Rites of Zhou, which established hierarchical codes and ceremonial regulations, as a tool for rulers to maintain their dominance. Additionally, the Rites of Zhou contained extensive divination practices, carrying a strong superstitious tinge. However, delving deeper into the core values of the Rites of Zhou reveals another layer of significance: maintaining social order to enable harmonious coexistence among all strata and mitigate resentment. Rituals emphasized differentiation—"honoring the honorable"; music emphasized harmony—"cherishing kinship." Differentiation and harmony were two sides of the same coin in consolidating internal unity among the Zhou people. [When music prevails, there is no resentment; when rituals prevail, there is no contention](), thereby constructing a cooperative framework for human society where rulers act as rulers, ministers as ministers, fathers as fathers, and sons as sons.  

In formulating rituals, the Duke of Zhou focused not only on the nobility but also paid considerable attention to the common people. After quelling the Rebellion of the Three Superintendents, he enfeoffed his younger brother, Kang Shu, in the former capital of the Shang Dynasty, Chaoge. To consolidate Zhou's rule, the Duke of Zhou issued various decrees, which reflect his summarization of the governance experiences of the Xia and Shang dynasties and the policies he formulated. He admonished the young Kang Shu that the Shang Dynasty perished because King Zhou indulged in wine and women, leading to chaos in the court and uprisings among the nobles. He instructed, "Upon arriving in Yin (the former Shang territory), first seek out the wise elders there and consult them on the reasons for the rise and fall of the Shang Dynasty; second, make sure to love the people." The Duke of Zhou then wrote *The Announcement to Kang*, *The Announcement on Wine*, and *The Announcement on Timbers* based on these instructions, presenting them to Kang Shu as guidelines. The reasons for writing these three decrees were twofold: first, Kang Shu governed the heartland of the Yin people, where issues were the most acute and complex; second, this region was where the Duke of Zhou first quelled the rebellion, as it was the stronghold of the Yin people who supported the Three Superintendents in their revolt against Zhou. These three decrees can be seen as the Duke of Zhou's administrative guidelines for newly conquered regions. Their core principles were "revering Heaven and protecting the people" and "upholding virtue and exercising prudence in punishment," aiming to stabilize the Yin people after two major upheavals and enable them to engage in normal agricultural and commercial activities. However, this leniency was not without limits; those who indulged excessively in wine or were unfilial or unbrotherly faced no leniency. After arriving in Yin, Kang Shu heeded the Duke of Zhou's instructions, lived frugally, and cared for the people, ensuring peace and prosperity for local officials and commoners.  

#### Rituals and Music Are Rules 【★★★】  
To understand what the Rites of Zhou that Confucius cherished entailed, we might find it initially challenging to grasp the essence of the Rites of Zhou and the concept of ritual-music culture. However, if we reframe these terms, it becomes clearer: the Rites of Zhou, or ritual-music culture, essentially refer to intangible "rules"—a form of order, a set of behavioral standards that all individuals and states should follow. Under the constraints of these rules, interactions between individuals and between states can be more harmonious. The entire group and the super-group above it can gain greater cooperative dividends, which are ultimately distributed to each individual. This is akin to the solution to the queuing dilemma: individuals who adhere to these rules may seem to "bind themselves with self-imposed constraints," reducing their individual fitness; yet, when the entire group adheres to these rules, collective unity, mutual benefit, and win-win outcomes are achieved.  

The Duke of Zhou essentially embedded these rules within the sacrificial culture of "rituals and music." Ritual-music culture originated in the clan era of Chinese civilization, serving as a cultural activity for clan kinship. Through ritual and musical sacrifices, the entire clan gathered, with each member assigned a role, position, order, and duty, leaving no one abandoned—this was "ritual." Rituals entailed distinctions but no opposition. The rules demonstrated in ritual-music activities were pairwise, reciprocal, interactive, balanced, and appropriate. In the physical movements of "rituals" and the joyous songs and dances of "music," each person held a "title." Titles necessarily corresponded, balanced, and suited: ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife, male-female, elder-younger. When members of other clans arrived, they were "friends." Actions thus followed titles and rituals—simple, clear, and understandable. Mutual exchanges and reciprocal responses gave rise to rules, principles, and values.  

From this, we observe that [rituals emphasize appropriateness rather than fairness; they emphasize differentiation and reciprocity rather than equality. Music, on the other hand, emphasizes the result of joy and harmony](). These concepts are remarkably forward-thinking; in fact, I believe they are more profound than concepts such as democracy, freedom, and equality (these topics will be further explored in the next volume). [Within a system of division of labor and cooperation, absolute fairness fundamentally does not exist](). Absolute fairness is predicated on absolute homogeneity—for example, giving a dog and a cat each a mouse may seem fair on the surface, but it is grossly unfair to the dog. Absolute fairness is only possible when all entities are homogeneous. [However, the large-scale social division of labor in human society necessitates that humanity's future evolves toward heterogeneity and individuality, a general trend to increase cooperative dividends, which eliminates the foundation for absolute fairness]().  

Take the most basic cooperation between men and women: men cannot assist women in childbirth, and most women cannot dedicate as much time to work as men. Every individual is important and irreplaceable. Mutual understanding, respect, support, and each person fulfilling their role to the best of their ability form the foundation for a thriving, stable, and harmonious human society. A one-sided pursuit of absolute fairness and equal treatment will instead backfire, causing harm to group interests.  

As previously mentioned, humanity, as a fourth-dimensional life community, has entered a state of profound social division of labor. Some are the "brain" of human society; others, the "heart"; some, the "hands"; others, the "immune cells." Compassion serves as the "pain-sensing nerve" that maintains cooperative relations between different "organs." In this state, the most fearsome scenario is the "brain" looking down on the "heart," the "heart" despising the "hands," leading to internal strife and "fratricidal" conflicts. Both the Duke of Zhou and Confucius deeply understood this principle, which is why they dedicated their lives to preventing human society from descending into this dire path.

Within the most ancient thoughts of the Chinese nation lies a profound wisdom that transcends time—a wisdom potentially holding the key to resolving future human societal challenges, and perhaps one of the few paths to preventing Adversarial Evolution from plunging into the abyss of suffering and tragedy. This wisdom may never have grown obsolete; we may have simply failed to truly understand it, to grasp these treasures inscribed deep within the human genetic code. To do so, we must ascend to a higher vantage point, adopt a broader perspective, and with deeper insight, sift through the chaff to reveal the essence, re-examining and rediscovering its significance.  

## Rituals of War—"Even as a Descendant of a Fallen State, I Will Not Sound the Drums to Attack an Unformed Formation"【★】  
The Rituals of War established by the Duke of Zhou are closely tied to the theme of this section: Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Let us explore this further.  

Wars during the Spring and Autumn Period were highly rule-bound and ceremonial, akin to modern basketball or football matches—aimed at determining superiority, not at slaughter or annexation. The process generally followed these rules:  

First, *just cause*. War could only be waged to punish unvirtuous states. Though later states increasingly fabricated moral pretexts (exemplifying Group Hypocrisyism), during the early Zhou era, this principle was largely observed. Some states spent years gathering even a tenuous justification for war. In 656 BCE, Duke Huan of Qi led a coalition to besiege Chu. The underlying motive was to contain Chu’s northward expansion, but the stated pretext was Chu’s long neglect of tribute to the Zhou king—specifically, *bao mao* (sacrificial reeds).  

Second, *openness and fairness*. Wars could not exploit a state in mourning or famine; sneak attacks and underhanded tactics were forbidden. Battles had to be fought with honor.  

Third, *envoys unharmed*. Before engaging, both sides dispatched envoys to present their case—a rule universally recognized.  

Fourth, *time limits*. Like modern football matches with set durations and halftime, Spring and Autumn wars typically lasted one day, concluding once victory was determined.  

Fifth, *battlefield location*. Wars were generally confined to border regions, with armies assembling at their respective frontiers—a practice that gave rise to the term "frontier battlefield" (*jiangchang*).  

Sixth, *specific rules*. For instance, if a sovereign was encountered on the field, he could not be attacked and must be saluted.  

What was the essence of these Rituals of War? Were they mere arbitrary formalities? By no means. They were institutional frameworks designed to curb Grabbingism and prevent the catastrophic losses of the Law of Grabbing Deficit.  

### The Battle of Hongshui  
Let us examine the most famous instance of adherence to these rituals: the Battle of Hongshui. As recorded in *Zuo Zhuan* by Zuo Qiuming, in 638 BCE, Song and Chu vied for dominance over the Central Plains, clashing at Hong (present-day Zhecheng County, Henan). By the time Song’s forces had fully arrayed, Chu’s army was still crossing the Hong River. Ziyu, a general under Duke Xiang of Song, urged an attack, but Duke Xiang refused. When Chu’s army had crossed the river but not yet formed ranks, Ziyu pleaded again—only to be denied. Finally, after Chu’s forces were fully arrayed, battle was joined. Outnumbered, Song’s army was routed, and Duke Xiang was wounded. His injury worsened the following year, leading to his tragic death.  

Later, the people blamed Duke Xiang, but he retorted: "A noble does not harm the wounded, nor capture the gray-haired. Ancient warfare did not exploit strategic advantages. Even as a descendant of a fallen state [the Shang], I will not sound the drums to attack an unformed formation." Translated, this means: A noble fights without harming the injured, avoids capturing the elderly, and refrains from using terrain to his advantage. Though I am a remnant of a defeated dynasty, I will not violate ritual by attacking an unformed enemy.  

This battle earned Duke Xiang the derisive label of "stupidly benevolent" among those who subscribed to the "might makes right" mentality, rendering him a figure of mockery in later Chinese history. From a modern perspective, his conduct seems absurd—war is a life-or-death struggle, after all, and "all’s fair in war," as Sun Tzu’s *Art of War* asserts: "War is the way of deception." Why, then, was Duke Xiang so "foolish"? To understand, we must situate him within his historical and cultural context.  

Song was a state ruled by descendants of the Shang royal family, a cradle of sagely culture and a stronghold of Zhou ritual traditions. Duke Xiang had been raised in rigorous aristocratic education, where nobility of bearing was ingrained in his very being. In war, he sought not just victory, but to win "handsomely," "righteously," and "nobly"; in a sense, his conduct mattered more than the outcome. Those rituals that seem absurd today were not mere ceremony—they were matters of principle. Duke Xiang’s "foolishness" was, in fact, a manifestation of the aristocratic ethos of his era, a trait shared by his contemporaries.  

### The Battle of Yanling  
Consider another example from *Zuo Zhuan*: the Battle of Yanling between Jin and Chu. The text records: "Xi Zhi encountered the Chu king’s troops three times. Each time he saw the King of Chu, he dismounted, removed his helmet, and hurried past with deference." During this battle, Xi Zhi, a top general of Jin, encountered King Gong of Chu three times. On each occasion, he removed his helmet and stood respectfully by the roadside. Impressed by Xi Zhi’s demeanor, King Gong sent an envoy to present him with a bow, saying: "You have gone to great trouble to show such deference each time we meet." Xi Zhi replied to the envoy: "As a subject of another state, I fight under my king’s command. In armor, I cannot bow to you here. I am humbled by your sovereign’s gesture. In the heat of battle, I can only offer this salute." With that, he bowed three times before departing.  

### The Battle of Bi between Jin and Chu  
During the Battle of Bi, Jin’s army collapsed in retreat. One Jin chariot became stuck in mud. When Chu’s pursuing forces arrived, they first helped the Jin soldiers repair their chariot, then resumed the chase. The chariot broke down again, and Chu’s troops assisted once more before continuing. Eventually, the Jin soldiers escaped, calling back, "Truly, Chu’s army is expert even at chasing fugitives!" For these armies, the spirit of camaraderie outweighed the outcome.  

### The Death of Hua Bao  
A classic example from *Zuo Zhuan* is the duel between Prince Cheng of Song and Hua Bao. Their chariots clashed; Hua Bao drew his bow and shot, but missed. Swiftly, he nocked another arrow. Prince Cheng scoffed: "To shoot again is base!"—meaning the rule was one shot per side. Having fired, Hua Bao should wait for Prince Cheng’s turn. Abiding by the rule, Hua Bao lowered his bow and waited, only to be killed by Prince Cheng’s arrow. Hua Bao’s conduct may seem absurd today, mocked as "sacrificing life for pride."  

### Zilu Adjusting His Cap  
During the anti-Confucius campaigns of the past, one oft-cited story was Zilu adjusting his cap: Zilu, a disciple of Confucius, was killed in battle. As he lay dying, he took time to straighten his askew cap and fasten its ties. Critics used this to deride Confucianism as a dogma that led to absurd rigidity. Yet a core principle of Zhou ritual was preserving dignity and bearing in all circumstances. Zilu’s act of fastening his cap amid enemy blades exemplified the aristocratic composure in the face of death.  

### Chivalry  
While the spirit of Zhou rituals may feel distant, many are familiar with chivalry. Medieval European knights abided by codes: sparing captives, not attacking unarmored knights, and protecting non-combatants (women, children, the elderly). In 1135, when King Henry I of England died, his grandson Henry II and nephew Stephen both claimed the throne. Stephen seized power first, but Henry II challenged him. In their first conflict, the 14-year-old Henry, unprepared, ran out of supplies and, in desperation, requested aid from Stephen. Remarkably, Stephen lent him funds to disband his starving mercenaries, ending the first war inconclusively. Years later, Henry returned stronger, defeated Stephen, and the two negotiated an outcome that astounded: Stephen remained king but named Henry his heir, ensuring Henry’s ascension upon Stephen’s death. Henry II’s Plantagenet dynasty became the most powerful in medieval England, and his legal reforms—including circuit courts and the jury system—left an indelible mark on legal history.  

Duke Xiang’s wartime ethics and European chivalry are strikingly similar, reflecting shared aristocratic values and codes of conduct.  

### Roman Spirit

In fact, such characteristics were not exclusive to the early stages of Chinese civilization; the nascent period of Western civilization exhibited similar traits as well. At the very least, from the accounts of ancient Rome in Nanami Shiono's *History of the Romans*, we observe that the statecraft of ancient Rome also embodied analogous principles. Though not as meticulously codified as the martial rites of the Rites of Zhou, Roman warfare emphasized straightforwardness, face-to-face confrontation, and decisive resolution, adhering to order without resorting to cunning. It was precisely because Rome held internal moral standards for warfare that it suffered severe setbacks when first encountering Hannibal, who disregarded conventional tactics. The losses Rome incurred were no less than those of Duke Xiang of Song; Hannibal, with forces far smaller than Rome's, rampaged through Roman territories, capturing cities as if unopposed. Hannibal was an exception of his era. Even contemporary military geniuses like Alexander, renowned for strategic brilliance, revered direct combat over intrigue. Alexander rarely launched surprise attacks or employed stratagems to destroy enemies. Among Homeric heroes, his favorite was Achilles—noble, valiant, yet unversed in scheming. Hence, Alexander has long been titled "the Great" in Western history.  

### Naive Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
[The spirit of the Rites of Zhou, particularly its martial codes, reflects a tendency to extend the principles of interpersonal conduct to relations between groups. This means that interactions between groups should also adhere to morality and rules, marking the germination of naive Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism.]  

Was this system effective? I believe it was highly functional during the early years of the Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou Dynasty, the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history, endured from the 11th century BCE to 256 BCE, spanning 30 generations and 37 kings—approximately 791 years. From its founding, the Zhou enfeoffed nobles, and by the Eastern Zhou period, the central authority had already weakened significantly. The various vassal states were bound primarily by the Rites of Zhou established in the early Zhou era. Despite this, the Eastern Zhou persisted for over 500 years. In hindsight, this is remarkable: during the Three Kingdoms period, rival powers were conquered within a few decades; the Sixteen Kingdoms era lasted just over a century, marked by constant warfare; and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period spanned a mere fifty years. The Eastern Zhou states coexisted peacefully for centuries, with major conflicts emerging only in the late Warring States period as the Rites of Zhou gradually declined. During the Spring and Autumn period, relations between states remained relatively amicable.  

More significant than the dynasty’s longevity was the intellectual flourishing of the Hundred Schools of Thought during the Eastern Zhou—a cultural renaissance unparalleled in Chinese history before or since.  

### The Rites of Zhou Were Not Mere Formality  
Two vassal states of the Zhou were exceptional: Lu and Song, the most steadfast preservers of the Rites of Zhou.  

#### The State of Lu  
Lu, enfeoffed to the Duke of Zhou (Zhou Gongdan), was renowned as a land of ritual propriety, deeply rooted in Zhou culture from its founding. Even as "rites decayed and music collapsed" in later eras, Lu remained the custodian and practitioner of authentic Zhou rituals, earning the reputation that "all the Rites of Zhou reside in Lu." Lu was also a cradle of sage culture; Confucius and Mencius were both natives of Lu.  

When the State of Wu planned to attack Lu, Wu envoys consulted Shusun Zhe about Lu’s vulnerabilities. Shusun Zhe replied, "Lu has a reputation for propriety but lacks substance; attacking it will surely succeed." He later relayed this to Gongshan Buniu, who retorted, "[This violates propriety.] A noble, when exiled, does not seek refuge in an enemy state. If one has not yet served another state, upon its attack on one’s homeland, one should return to defend it, even if it means death. One should conceal one’s homeland’s weaknesses. Moreover, a person’s conduct should not let personal grievances override loyalty to their home. You now seek to destroy your ancestral state over minor grudges—how excessive! If the king orders you to lead the attack, you must decline. He will then appoint me, and I will rectify your error."  

True to his word, the King of Wu ordered Shusun Zhe to lead the attack, but Shusun feigned illness. The king then asked Gongshan Buniu, "Can Lu be attacked?" Gongshan replied, "Though Lu has no allies, it will have companions in adversity. The feudal lords will come to its aid, making our success impossible. Jin, Qi, and Chu will support Lu—four enemies in total. Lu, Qi, and Jin are as lips and teeth: if the lips perish, the teeth will be cold, as Your Majesty knows. How can they not come to Lu’s aid?"  

—*Zuo Zhuan·Year 8 of Duke Ai*  

This historical account demonstrates the subtle influence of ritual propriety. Even exiles remained guided by the Rites of Zhou, which implicitly protected "virtuous" states. Despite occasional conflicts with other vassals, Lu, deeply committed to the Rites of Zhou, maintained amicable relations with most states, adopting a stance akin to neutrality. Thus, major states adhering to the Rites of Zhou hesitated to attack Lu. Though Lu grew weak by the Warring States period, no state dared to assault it—for lack of a just cause. A hasty attack would have invited joint reprisal from other powers, as later occurred with Song. Only in the final three decades of the Warring States period, when Chu had lost vast territories to Qin and the feudal lords were preoccupied with their own survival, did Chu—an edge people less influenced by the Rites of Zhou—conquer Lu. Yet, Lu’s ritual and musical culture endured, and Shandong (Shan-tung) retains "Lu" as a cultural identifier.  

#### The State of Song  
In the early Western Zhou, after suppressing the Three Guards Rebellion, the Duke of Zhou, following the tradition of "reviving fallen states and continuing extinct lineages," enfeoffed Weizi Qi, elder brother of King Zhou of Shang, in Shangqiu, the former capital of the Shang Dynasty in 1039 BCE. *The Analects·Yao Yue* states, "Revive extinguished states, continue broken lineages, elevate displaced talents—then the people of the world will pledge their loyalty." This was an ancient martial ethic: even after defeating a state, one should not annihilate it but grant a territory for its continuation, winning the hearts of the people. Shangqiu, an early imperial capital and a core region of the Central Plains, was a cradle of Chinese civilization.  

The nobles of the former Shang, known as "Yin survivors," established Song as a source of sage culture. Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Logism—four core schools of Chinese thought—originated here. Shangqiu is thus hailed as the "Circle of Chinese Sage Culture," with Confucius, Mozi, Zhuangzi, and Huizi all associated with Song (Confucius, though born in Lu, traced his ancestry to Song and was a descendant of the Shang royal family).  

As seen in Duke Xiang of Song, Song also upheld the Rites of Zhou and emphasized benevolence. Additionally, Song prioritized commerce, fostering a thriving merchant culture and three commercial hubs—Shangqiu, Taoqiu, and Pengcheng—becoming a center of wealth. In contrast to Qin, which focused solely on agriculture and warfare, Song displayed greater creativity and foresight. Though coveted by major states, Song was not conquered until the late Warring States period, when internal strife erupted after the Dai clan seized power. King Yan of Song, a tyrant, indulged in debauchery, shot blood-filled bags to "subdue spirits," and executed advisors, earning the moniker "King Jie of Song." Taking advantage of Song’s chaos and the people’s discontent, Qi conquered Song. However, Qi itself was later attacked by a coalition of states using Song’s conquest as a pretext, nearly facing annihilation. Thus, without just cause, no state dared to destroy Song.  

This demonstrates that the soft constraints of the Rites of Zhou did enhance the adaptability of states adhering to them. I believe [the spirit of the Rites of Zhou operated subtly, akin to individual Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. It essentially functioned as a "group virtue selection" mechanism, enabling "virtuous" groups to gain adaptive advantages through support from other groups, while suppressing and weeding out "grabbing" and evil groups. To date, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism remains an excellent strategy to curb the spread of Grabbingism in the process of group Adversarial Evolution.]  

## Marching Toward the Fifth Dimension—The Most Visionary "Dimension Ascension" Attempt in the History of Life  
Humankind is a species of "miracles," never lacking in ingenuity, courage to sacrifice for ideals, or perseverance. [Their greatest adversary is "confusion"; their worst state is being "brainwashed" and "exploited."]

In the annals of human history, as well as the entire history of life on Earth, the two periods closest to the Quasi-Five-Dimensional Life Form are: the Zhou Dynasty and the Roman Empire. These two great communities stand out as exceptionally long-lived dynasties in human history. After unifying the Central Plains, the Zhou Dynasty endured for nearly 800 years (its pre-unification history remains unclear). The Roman Empire, counting its regal period, spanned over 1,200 years, making it one of the rare states to celebrate a millennial anniversary. Even from the start of its imperial period (after largely unifying Western Europe), it lasted approximately 500 years. By this measure, the Zhou Empire was even longer-lived than the Roman Empire. Regardless, both these vast empires developed their own methods to address the challenge of cooperative mutual benefit among multiple states and ethnic groups. Though they ultimately failed, they remain nearly the most successful cases in human history.  

### Rituals and Laws Among Zhou Feudal States  
In the early Zhou Dynasty, there were at least over 100 fiefdoms, with some accounts extravagantly claiming up to 800. In the later Roman Empire, there were over 100 provinces (after Diocletian’s reforms). The relationships among Zhou fiefdoms bore a fundamental resemblance to those among Roman provinces. They were not absolute hierarchies of ruler and ruled, but more akin to equal cooperative relationships. As previously discussed, the Zhou Dynasty employed the *ritual of warfare* to prevent grabbing-style competition among these fiefdoms and to protect "weak but virtuous" states, such as the State of Lu. This small state, which rarely annexed others, survived for nearly 800 years—contemporary with the Zhou Dynasty itself—a feat for which the ritual of warfare and the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism deserve much credit. Though this success endured only a few hundred years, it is quite remarkable when viewed through the lens of human history.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5bad893-384c-4c58-b2af-3fea6ebc4b9f" /></p>  

Moreover, this moral-oriented ritual tradition bore no resemblance to the "blind loyalty" of later centralized regimes. The highest ruling class was most prone to corruption: when King You of Zhou acted unvirtuously and his capital Hao was besieged, the feudal states did not offer "blind loyalty" by rushing to his aid. After the Marquis of Shen and others executed King You, they did not establish a new political system but continued to uphold Zhou institutions and rituals. Even the "rebellious" State of Qin only defeated the other six states in the late Warring States period, when those states had grown deeply corrupt. Without the constraints of Zhou rituals, Qin might have overthrown the Zhou Dynasty centuries earlier. Having discussed Zhou rituals and the warfare code at length, we now turn to another extraordinarily successful hyper-group human community in history—the Roman Empire.  

### Rome’s Trans-ethnic Community Consciousness  
A classic question in historiography asks: ["The Romans were less technologically advanced than the Etruscans, less intellectually gifted than the Greeks, less adept at commerce than the Carthaginians, less physically robust than the Gauls, and less formidable in combat than the Germans. Yet why did the Romans defeat them one by one and forge an unprecedented human civilizational community?"]()  

Compared to other polities, we observe that Roman society exhibited remarkable unity across its diverse ethnic groups, a trait most evident during the Punic Wars. In contrast, other states—such as the early Roman adversary Etruscans—were fragmented and disunited, rendering them ineffective. A more striking example is the once-mighty Greek city-states, which produced geniuses across all fields: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pericles, Alexander, and Pyrrhus. Yet despite this constellation of talent, the Greek world ultimately collapsed.  

<p align="center"><img width="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efae2ae4-03e0-4b89-b86c-4145b476c4e7" /><img width="205" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de4f4571-7c3f-4ce1-9f30-dfaae020d1e8" /><img width="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b8f4ec8-fb50-4d56-888b-9e21b45d5085" /></p>  

#### The Disunited "Greeks"  
The apex of Greek civilization likely occurred after Athens repelled the Persians and established the Delian League, turning the Aegean Sea into its internal lake—a period known as the Athenian Empire.  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5812b8fa-fd1d-49e0-8354-d3f661d38d75" /></p>  

However, the Greek city-states were deeply divided. The two major factions, Sparta and Athens, were bitterly opposed. Even within the Athenian Empire (the Delian League), unity was lacking: many allies were coerced into joining, and Athens extorted tribute and suppressed secessionists, eventually alienating its partners. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta exhausted their resources, leading to unprecedented destruction of the Greek world, which was later conquered by Macedonia and eventually absorbed by Rome. Notably, Rome did not annihilate Greece but protected it from external threats, leading to Greek submission. Despite their advanced institutions, sophisticated civilization, and individual prowess, the Greeks proved far less capable than the Romans in managing hyper-group communities.  

It is worth noting that individual Greek city-states, such as Sparta, could be highly unified internally. The 300 Spartan warriors, known for their unyielding courage and combat prowess, exemplify this. Yet Sparta was deeply hostile to foreign peoples, both within and beyond its borders. Rome’s adversaries—the Etruscans, Greeks, Carthaginians, Gauls, and Germans—each excelled individually but suffered from low group cooperation, ultimately crumbling due to internal strife.  

#### Rome’s Spirit of Tolerance  
In stark contrast, Rome’s foreign policy was defined by: forming alliances with other tribes, granting citizenship directly, allowing talented individuals to enter the Senate, and even selecting kings from foreign ethnicities. Rome treated its allies as follows: during wars, Romans served as the main force, leading the charge, while allies provided auxiliary troops, and spoils of war were shared. To be clear, Rome was a military power with strategic expansionist intentions, but its actions essentially fell within the scope of Non-grabbing Competition (comparable to warfare during China’s Spring and Autumn period). In that era, a lack of territorial awareness would have doomed any people to weakness or extinction. Yet we must discern qualitative differences beneath quantitative actions. First, Rome’s military mobilization rate was low (only one-tenth that of the late Warring States Qin). Second, and most importantly, Rome’s defeat of neighboring states was not for short-term gain but to establish relatively equal alliances—alliances that benefited the entire hyper-group community, with warfare serving merely as a means to this end.  

Rome repeatedly showed mercy to defeated states (unless they repeatedly broke treaties and betrayed trust) and often used its power to maintain order among neighbors. Rome’s principles included no military occupation, no military bases, no stationed troops, and full recognition of each state’s internal autonomy. It hoped that states would thrive economically in a peaceful environment. ["In terms of tolerance toward foreign peoples, and in vision and breadth of mind, the Romans were exceptionally outstanding, whether dealing with resisters or the defeated."]()  

For example, after defeating the Samnites, who had humiliated Rome at the Caudine Forks, the Romans did not seek revenge. Thirty years later, a Samnite even became a Roman consul—a feat as inconceivable as a Chinese person becoming President of the United States. Another example is Caesar, who granted generous treatment to Gallic tribes that had repeatedly threatened his life in battle, with capable individuals entering Rome’s ruling core—the Senate. Caesar astutely recognized that the privileged patricians of Rome and the Senate were prone to corruption, necessitating fresh foreign blood to revitalize the empire. Rome’s later history bore this out: the decaying empire was only prolonged by the efforts of Stilicho, the "last Roman" and a barbarian general. It was Caesar’s adherence to Rome’s traditional spirit of tolerance toward foreigners and his commitment to fostering mutual benefit that enabled Rome to endure for a millennium.  

While Rome’s legal spirit is well-known, its moral outlook was equally advanced. Rome always respected opponents who were trustworthy, tenacious, and resolute. It rarely exacted revenge on defeated foes; the sole exception was the Carthaginian Empire, which repeatedly broke treaties and betrayed trust. Driven by radical elements led by Cato the Elder, Rome carried out the "destruction of Carthage."  

#### Trans-ethnic Community Consciousness  
This spirit of tolerance stemmed from Rome’s strong trans-ethnic community consciousness. Early on, it excelled at uniting surrounding powers, establishing the "Roman League" and "Latin League." The Roman League’s treaties stipulated that member states could only conclude agreements with Rome, not with other members. Disputes between members could not be resolved bilaterally but required Roman arbitration. By leveraging its absolute military strength, Rome sought to establish "international rules" to reward virtue and punish vice among states—integrating exceptional individuals and families into its core leadership. This was an extraordinarily forward-thinking strategy, far more astute than the exploitative grabbing tactics of most prior and subsequent hegemonic empires, and it was key to Rome’s longevity.

Had Rome not established such a robust international alliance system in the early days of its Republic, it would have stood little chance of success in the face of the Hannibalic War. During the most arduous phase of the Punic Wars, it was precisely Rome’s allied states that remained steadfast in their alignment with Rome, continuously supplying troops and generals—without which Rome could scarcely have persisted to final victory. Though the Roman alliance appeared loose, it surged with unmeasurable resilience and cohesion at critical junctures, a force Hannibal had neither anticipated nor accounted for, and this proved the fundamental cause of his defeat. This stands in stark contrast to later empires, where internal strife and infighting erupted long before external pressures, sowing chaos from within.  

Numerous episodes reflect the Roman spirit of tolerance and cross-group communal consciousness during this period. Tolerance and non-malfeasance were nearly a tradition in early and mid-Republican Rome, one that extended even to foreign peoples, rooted in customs dating back to the city’s founding. Rome first assimilated the Sabines, who had been defeated by Rome in four wars. Instead of annexing them, Rome invited the Sabines to form a co-governing alliance, with the merged state ruled jointly by the Sabine king and Romulus. After unification, the Sabines enjoyed full citizen rights equal to those of the Romans, and Sabine elders were granted seats in the Roman Senate. Numa, a Sabine, even became the second king of Rome’s monarchical era, leaving an indelible mark on the city’s development.  

More remarkably, after defeating the Kingdom of Alba Longa, though Rome executed its untrustworthy king by chariot dismemberment, it treated Alba’s nobility with great favor. Prominent figures among the nobility, such as Quintilius, Servius, and Julius—names that would profoundly shape Roman history—were awarded seats in the Senate. This cross-ethnic commitment to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism (Good for Virtue and Bad for Evil) was truly exceptional. Had Rome reduced defeated peoples to slavery like many conquerors of the time, there might well have been no Gaius Julius Caesar. Plutarch writes in *Lives*: “Nothing has contributed more to Rome’s strength than the practice of assimilating the conquered.” The term “assimilation” captures this process precisely: by selecting “virtuous individuals” from foreign peoples and integrating them into the state, Rome expanded its Justice League.  

By the era of Scipio, following the conclusion of the Second Punic War, when Macedon launched military aggression against Rome’s allies—the Greek city-states—the Roman Senate, disregarding public opposition and the need for respite after the Punic Wars, resolutely organized volunteer forces to defend the Greek states. They ultimately defeated Macedon, still under the shadow of Alexander’s legacy. But the Greeks, accustomed to Eastern political machinations, could scarcely believe that the victorious Romans would abandon strategic strongholds and grant the Greek cities autonomy. Only when Roman commander Flamininus declared that the Greeks were fully restored to freedom—exempt from annual tributes, taxes, and obligations to provide military bases, with all Roman troops withdrawn—did the Greek city-states accept the reality. They marveled that foreign Romans had fought and bled at their own expense to save them, only to withdraw with nearly no demands.  

In this era, the Romans, leveraging their formidable military might, enforced rewards for virtue and punishments for evil within this super-group. Communities practicing Group Grabbingism—Carthage, Macedon, Syria, and Mediterranean pirates—were systematically dismantled by Rome. Superficially, Caesar’s campaigns in Gaul and Hannibal’s war against Rome might both be labeled “aggressive,” differing only in outcome. Yet the distinctions are profound: the order established post-conquest, the status of virtuous individuals among the defeated, and more. In a sense, Caesar sought to infuse Rome with fresh Gallic vitality to counter its decay, while uniting the fractious Gallic tribes; Hannibal’s war, by contrast, was more a personal vendetta.  

The ascendant Romans not only displayed tolerance toward the defeated but excelled at learning from them, adopting their strengths and forging cooperative divisions of labor. Though culturally less refined than the Greeks, they revered Greek culture and took pride in mastering Greek; though less adept at commerce than the Carthaginians, they learned navigation from them; and though less skilled in cavalry than the Gauls, Gaul became a key supplier of horses and mounted troops.  

We can analyze the essence of this phenomenon through the lens of Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity. Mitochondria and prokaryotic cells were once independent life forms. When a prokaryotic cell (Rome) engulfed a mitochondrion, it did not shortsightedly decompose it for energy (plunder) or eliminate it genetically (exterminate). Instead, it preserved the mitochondrion, harnessed its strengths, provided it with raw materials, and allowed it to propagate—working together for the symbiont’s benefit. This prokaryotic cell underwent a qualitative transformation, achieving Dimension Ascension to become a eukaryotic cell.  

### Roman Personal Morality  
Furthermore, Roman communal consciousness found expression in the personal morality of its citizens. Romans held honor and oaths in the highest regard, meting out harsh punishment to nations or peoples that broke their word. Yet they were scrupulously faithful to their own commitments. For instance, after the defeat at the Battle of Asculum, during peace negotiations, Roman envoys requested the return of 600 Roman prisoners, vowing to return them if talks failed. When negotiations did collapse, these 600 soldiers, having just reunited with their families, departed once more—without a single defection.  

The story of Regulus is also well-remembered. As a consul captured during the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian king offered him freedom in exchange for persuading the Roman Senate to sue for peace. Instead, Regulus returned to Rome, urging the Senate to reject peace, then honorably returned to Carthage, where he was tortured to death.  

Though Romans cherished their bloodlines and took great pride in their families, they were surprisingly impartial—even “heartless” in their justice. Brutus, the founder of the Roman Republic, condemned his own sons to death for treason, despite an unwritten rule allowing self-exile to avoid punishment.  

The patrician class (senatorial nobility) of early Rome bore a profound sense of national responsibility. They funded public projects and infrastructure from their own purses, led troops into battle, and never shirked danger in times of national crisis. When Rome was sacked by the Celts (the only such event before its fall), the remaining citizens fled to Capitol Hill, a refuge limited to soldiers and their families. Many senators remained in their homes, awaiting the barbarians’ slaughter. Though an aristocracy, the Roman Senate shouldered far greater burdens than commoners: leading charges in war, financing public works, and devoting themselves to governance with little recompense—some even bankrupting themselves to save the state. The hundred-member Senate convened by Romulus in 753 BCE saw its noble families dwindle to a fifth of their original number five centuries later, as lineages died out or lacked male heirs—a testament to the sacrifices made by Roman senators.  

Early Republican Romans were deeply collectivist, with little hypocrisy or infighting. Certain historical moments are particularly telling. At the infamous Battle of Cannae, Rome suffered an unprecedented defeat, largely due to the decisions of plebeian consuls who advocated for confrontation. Prior to this, as Hannibal’s forces advanced, Rome divided between plebeian-led hawks and patrician-led proponents of prolonged war. Yet after the plebeian consuls’ defeat, the proponents of prolonged war neither blamed nor punished them; instead, they met the returning forces with慰问, and no patrician used the defeat to attack the plebeian leaders. In this crisis, Rome displayed unprecedented unity: women donated jewelry, allies withstood Hannibal’s pressure, and most remained steadfast, offering aid. Rome accepted this assistance through purchases, not charity. Such scenes recur in the annals of various peoples and nations, but few matched Rome’s magnanimity and resilience.  

Another notable Roman tradition was the sponsorship of promising young men, most notably through adoption. Adoption was never for old-age support—wealthy families had ample servants and thriving lineages. Instead, it aimed to elevate talented but politically or financially disadvantaged youth, enabling them to contribute to the Republic. A prime example is Caesar, who, despite having a high-born son and loyal lieutenants like Antony, willed his legacy to the unforeseen Octavian. Caesar’s judgment proved sound: Octavian carried forward his vision, fostering the “Pax Romana”—a rare era of peace in the Mediterranean—and elevating the Roman Empire to its zenith.

### The Age of the Five Good Emperors and the Dynamics of Cooperative Selection  

During the subsequent Age of the Five Good Emperors, nearly every ruler ascended the throne through adoption—including Nerva (96–98 CE), Trajan (98–117 CE), Hadrian (117–138 CE), Antoninus Pius (138–161 CE), and Marcus Aurelius (161–180 CE). It was the last of these, the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius, who broke this tradition by passing the throne to his biological son, marking the end of the era of virtuous rule. Those deeply acquainted with the mechanisms of selfish genes will share this reflection: the act of bequeathing power and wealth to an adopted heir rather than a blood-related son is an extraordinary display of "greatness." Even rulers without biological children rarely chose to pass authority to close relatives, and the very fact that these emperors did not amass harems or produce numerous offspring is itself worthy of admiration. This was a form of "abdication system" that eluded the rulers of many feudal dynasties—a feat achievable only by "foresighted" selfish genes.  

From its inception, the Roman people carried a great communal spirit in their bones, a spirit that manifested as a super-communal ethos in figures like Scipio and Caesar. I anticipate some readers may question this assessment, viewing Rome as merely a powerful "hegemonic" and "slave-owning" state, even a militaristic Grabbingist power. To be sure, Rome was far from perfect—but not because of its Grabbingist actions. As discussed in earlier chapters, "Virtue" in this context is not absolute pacifism; rather, it entails avoiding Grabbing Deficit and establishing mechanisms for Cooperative Dividend. Rome’s historical reputation has not always been favorable, and its rulers have been demonized. However, we must account for later corruption and the biased judgments of early Christianity. When compared horizontally to contemporary empires—the Athenian, Persian, Macedonian, Carthaginian, Parthian, and Qin-Han empires—their approaches to allies, defeated parties, and their own people, as well as the selfishness and corruption of their ruling classes, reveal fundamental differences. If any civilizations in human history best embodied the Virtue Selection Mechanism and the book’s definitions of Virtue and Evil, Rome and the Zhou Dynasty stand out as the most eminent, two great human communities that shone in tandem. The East excelled in foresight—equity, reciprocity, balance, and harmony, aspiring to a "Great Unity" of the world; the West excelled in practice—law, institutions, civic spirit, and communal consciousness.

### Group "Morality"—The Germination of Five-Dimensional Life  

Whether through the Zhou Dynasty’s wartime rituals or Rome’s efforts to uphold peace and prosperity across its vast empire, both exemplified the incipient realization of group "morality" in human society. Just as individual morality fosters cooperation, this group-level morality serves as the foundation for super-group cooperation. In today’s deeply globalized world, most have profoundly experienced the Cooperative Dividend generated by inter-group collaboration. Forward-thinking individuals have extended this super-group morality to the natural world, recognizing that humanity must seek harmony with nature, ecosystems, and other species to achieve true long-term stability. A grand five-dimensional life community is taking shape, transcending race, ethnicity, and geography—and even time and space. Composed of multiple four-dimensional life communities (nations and ethnic groups), its potential and energy far surpass what four-dimensional life forms can fathom.

These two ancient Eastern and Western civilizations reached unprecedented heights in the history of life, revealing the boundless potential of life communities. They demonstrated, to the cosmos, the highest dimensions and greatest attainments among all known life forms—the quasi-five-dimensional life community. Though they eventually withered like blooming flowers, they remain the greatest pioneers and forerunners among all life in the vast universe. Their endeavors stand as monumental testaments worthy of reverence by all life forms, glimpsing the wonder of the ultimate Dimension Ascension toward the life community.

## The Collapse of Rituals and Music and the Fall of the Eternal City—The Disintegration of Five-Dimensional Life 【★★】  

Though both the Zhou Dynasty and the Roman Empire achieved remarkable feats in human civilization, their ultimate success remained elusive. They failed to fundamentally alter the evolutionary trajectory of group dynamics. The tragedy of Zhou rituals and Roman ethos was, in essence, the tragedy of the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism and group morality—what Confucius lamented as "the collapse of rituals and music." Why did the Zhou rituals prove unsustainable? The Zhou system had flaws: excessive superstition, cumbersome rites, and a lack of a coherent logical framework to explain the importance of these "rules"—limitations of its era. Beyond these, the core challenge lay in sustaining the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism itself. Let us examine the obstacles to its formation from two angles.  

### Resistance to Group Altruism  

This process mirrors the difficulty of establishing stable "Virtue Selection" mechanisms in early humans. Most organisms struggle to stabilize such mechanisms, preventing the development of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Group Virtue Selection is even more challenging, requiring that the vast majority of individuals within a group possess the ability to discern Virtue and Evil and the resolve to reward Virtue and punish Evil—for upholding group justice often demands sacrificing short-term interests, a daunting task for most. For example, when Rome resolved to honor its alliance by sending troops to protect Greek city-states against Macedon, the Senate approved the decision, but the people opposed it. They saw no immediate threat to Roman security and deemed the risk and military expenditure for allies unnecessary.  

### The Decline of Group Morality  

Though the Western Roman Empire formally fell in 476 CE, its decline was long in the making. As early as 183 BCE, Scipio Africanus—the man who solidified Rome’s dominion over Spain, Africa, Greece, and Syria—uttered his final words: *"Ungrateful fatherland, what right do you have to my remains?"* In the end, the Romans never fully stepped into the realm of the super-human community.  

Cato the Elder, Scipio’s old rival, championed a rigid, ascetic ethos and resisted foreign Greek culture. He also opposed Scipio’s individual heroism, fearing it would undermine Rome’s republican system. Cato embodied an extreme collectivist ideology, fixated on narrow national interests—specifically, Rome’s. His vision was static: he feared all external threats, sought to maintain dominance not by strengthening Rome but by suppressing others, and likely lacked the courage to accept honorable defeat when outcompeted. He lacked the resolve to treat foreign peoples as equals, "Romanize" them, eliminate Evil, and nurture Virtue to enrich Rome. This stance was most evident in his relentless push to destroy Carthage, driven not by Carthaginian treachery but by fear of a second Hannibal.  

In contrast, Scipio and Caesar, through their own strength, showed tolerance toward rivals. Humanity needs both collectivism and individual heroism. To focus solely on collectivism would make ants humanity’s ultimate form; to focus solely on individual heroism would leave dinosaurs as our end. In reality, humanity thrives by balancing both. What we must avoid are the perils of extreme collectivism (blind xenophobia and the erasure of individuality) and extreme individual heroism (personality cults and blind obedience). Yet, as a rule, people see only one danger, rendering them incapable of sound judgment in the other. As Caesar often said: *"No one wishes to see the whole truth; most desire only what they want to see."* These two outlooks determined whether Rome would remain at the fourth dimension or ascend to the fifth. Every Dimension Ascension demands deeper understanding and dissection of Virtue and Evil. Sustaining "Virtue" requires more sophisticated mechanisms and a more precise comprehension of "Virtue"—a step even the great Cicero failed to take. Thus, the decline of Roman group morality was preordained, evident in Scipio’s prosecution, Carthage’s destruction, the Gracchi brothers’ deaths, Sulla’s civil war, Catiline’s conspiracy, and Caesar’s crossing of the Rubicon.  

### The Decline of Individual Morality  

Naturally, the erosion of individual morality also signaled Rome’s fall.

From the perspective of early Roman history, two major events that depleted a significant amount of virtuous genes were the Punic Wars (Hannibalic War) and the failure of the Gracchi Reforms. During the wars, it was undoubtedly the genes of those who were valiant, selfless, and willing to sacrifice for the Republic that were most depleted. The Gracchi brothers and their supporters, mostly enlightened nobles, were acutely aware that the growing corruption of the nobility and the plight of the plebeians posed a mortal threat to the Republic’s long-term stability—an insight particularly commendable given their status as beneficiaries of the aristocratic system. Their efforts represented a self-redemptive act by the Roman community, yet they ultimately failed, met with massacre, and the greatest loss remained that of virtuous genes. The rise of Hypocrisyists was also a symbol of Rome’s senescence.  

Both Cato the Elder and Cato the Younger shared similar traits—ostensibly noble private morals. However, in evaluating Cato the Elder, I must add a subjective conjecture: historical records suggest he exploited his senatorial power and wealth to acquire vast lands and employ slaves for personal gain. *If this were the case, then Cato the Elder would be a classic Hypocrisyist who upholds minor virtues while violating major ones*. He nitpicked at the corruption of national heroes like Scipio but profited from legal loopholes himself. His land annexation practices were a root cause of unequal land distribution and subsequent conflicts between plebeians and nobles—land consolidation being a common catalyst for dynastic collapse throughout history. The elder and younger Catos, in the name of republicanism, ultimately defended the power and interests of the senatorial class, which by then had lost the integrity of early Rome and become the first to decay.  

Later figures such as Marius, Sulla, Crassus, Catiline, and Claudius displayed increasingly deviant morals, while Pompey and Caesar exhibited excessive personal ambition. After Marius’ military reforms, Rome’s army gradually transitioned from a conscripted force to a professional one, with plundering Eastern wealth becoming a primary objective of campaigns. Sulla’s epitaph reads: “No better man existed for friends, no worse for enemies”—a quintessential Tit-for-Tat philosophy, not the foundation of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. The purpose of Roman consuls had subtly shifted to profiting from provincial governorships; many senators and nobles even borrowed heavily to bribe their way into these posts.  

Even Caesar, though broadly great, had notable flaws in private morals. His Gallic Wars unified a region previously torn by tribal conflicts, accelerating Gallic Romanization and integrating Gallic elites into Rome’s military and political core—actions that both unified Gaul and delayed Rome’s decay. However, Caesar’s historical context saw a Senate vastly degraded from its early republican vigor. During the civil war, for instance, the Senate began debating how to divide Caesar’s power and wealth before securing victory, only to suffer a crushing defeat—exposing its corruption and infighting, which had eroded Rome’s original spirit. Yet it remains unclear whether Caesar acted out of personal ambition or idealism. We must not overlook the immense Gallic casualties of his conquests (one account estimates 1 million deaths over eight years) or his alliances with figures like Crassus, Catiline, and Claudius. Caesar’s talent-focused recruitment resembled Cao Cao’s—prioritizing ability over virtue, which ultimately undermined the foundations of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. *From an evolutionary perspective*, figures like Caesar are “dangerous.” Their proliferation risks destabilizing the group, as their evolutionary path to collusion with malicious opportunists is alarmingly short.  

In contrast, Scipio Africanus, a century earlier, was more humble, less power-hungry, and morally upright. He voluntarily relinquished military command to return to Rome, whereas Caesar chose to cross the Rubicon at a similar juncture. Had Scipio been treated fairly instead of persecuted, Rome might have had a more virtuous leader to achieve Caesar’s goals with greater stability. Evolutionary causality remains intertwined: if not Caesar, and not by his methods, who else could have saved Rome? The Romans had already eliminated better candidates and approaches. Caesar was later eliminated too, and Octavian’s hypocrisy surpassed even his predecessor’s. The moral decline and indistinctness of Hypocrisyism led to the catastrophic outcome of “Reverse Virtue Selection”—soldiers fought for gold and land, not the collective. This regression inevitably militarized leadership, forcing commanders to offer exorbitant “bounties” to secure loyalty, which in turn became a competitive tool among warlords, effectively “selecting” those who resorted to military adventurism for profit. By the 1st century BCE, both collective and individual morals in Rome had decayed—this was no longer the Rome of old.  

A common question arises: why did the early Republic, with the same institutions, achieve such greatness (defeating Carthage, a Mediterranean power) while the late Republic inflicted such suffering on its people? The answer, often overlooked, is that *from an evolutionary perspective, Rome’s crisis lay not in its institutions but in the character of those who executed them*. The system remained, but the people changed—a pattern seen in Greece as well as Rome. Republicanism thrives only among a morally grounded aristocracy. For example, the dual consulship, which requires high cooperation between two leaders, became fragile as the nobility grew hypocritical, selfish, and Grabbingist. The republic, riddled with flaws, could only survive temporarily under autocratic rule.  

### The Destructive Role of Group Hypocrisyism and Its Evolutionary Conditions  
Group Hypocrisyism evolves similarly to Individual Hypocrisyism—it emerges within Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. After Shin Bup-hai’s reforms, the State of Han became a scheming power, often diverting crises to other states. During the Battle of Yique, Han requested Wei’s support but hesitated to engage, falling for Bai Qi’s feint and hoping to let Wei bear the brunt of Qin’s attack. This led to a decisive Qin victory over the Han-Wei coalition. Later, Han offered the strategic Shangdang region to both Qin and Zhao (a “wall” protecting Zhao from Qin), aiming to incite conflict between the two and profit from their strife. This backfired, as Han’s betrayal of Zhao triggered the Battle of Changping, where 400,000 Zhao soldiers were massacred—the bloodiest battle of the Warring States Period.  

Another example is King Xi of Yan, who, after signing a treaty with Zhao, exploited Zhao’s post-Changping weakness to break the agreement and attack. By this point, states had abandoned integrity for short-term gain. Yet weakening Zhao, a buffer against Qin, only hastened Yan’s own demise. By the late Warring States Period, interstate relations had lost all principles, with states prioritizing immediate self-interest. In 287 BCE, during the Five-State Coalition Against Qin, Qi secretly planned to annex war-torn Song. Unbeknownst to Qi, this was a trap set by Su Qin for Yan’s King Zhao to avenge Yan’s earlier subjugation by Qi. After Qi conquered Song, the other four states allied with Qin to nearly destroy Qi, leaving it with only two cities. Repeated attempts by the Six States to attack Qin failed due to their internal scheming, allowing the most “deviant” state—Qin—to prevail.  

### The Failure of the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism  
#### Rise and Fall Through the Lens of Territorial Size  
The limited efficacy of the Group Virtue Selection Mechanism is evident in territorial dynamics. The State of Lu, which rarely engaged in aggression, saw its neighbors expand through annexation while it shrank from a major state in the early Spring and Autumn Period to a minor one by the late Warring States Period. Though temporarily stabilized by the latent influence of Zhou rituals, Lu ultimately fell. Similarly, Song, which avoided large-scale annexation, declined from a major state to a non-seventh power by the late Warring States Period. In contrast, Qin and Chu—states least adhering to Zhou rituals—grew by absorbing smaller states, becoming the largest and most powerful by the late Warring States Period.  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27624f46-3c37-40fe-acea-e5a3dbbed59c" /></p>

<p align="center">The territorial size of Song and Lu diminished by the Warring States Period</p>

Looking back at the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, we observe an abundance of virtuous individuals and ethical states, yet in this era of intense contention, almost all of them "failed" to varying degrees. Examples include the Duke of Yan ceding his throne, Duke Xiang of Song defending wartime etiquette at the cost of his life and state interests, Lord Xinling stealing military credentials to rescue Zhao, Su Qin repaying the favor of recognition, the assassins recorded in *Records of the Assassins*, and chivalrous heroes—all of whom acted selflessly to repay kindness, avenge wrongs, or defend their states. Such behaviors were extraordinarily common in that era, yet they became increasingly rare in later history.  

### The State of Qin: The Greatest Violator of Zhou Rituals  
Among the Warring States, Qin was nearly the most flagrant disregard for the Rites of Zhou, yet it achieved "ultimate" victory. The extent of Qin’s bad faith is exemplified by the following incident: When Qin and Chu negotiated peace, Qin demanded that King Huai of Chu personally travel to Qin to proceed. During their meeting at Wuguan, King Zhao of Qin detained King Huai and coerced him into ceding territory. "Diplomats are not killed in war" was a fundamental principle of wartime etiquette (if even this could be violated, no one would dare negotiate, leading to endless conflict). Yet Qin violated this, detaining a sovereign during a peace conference. Earlier, during the Spring and Autumn period, King Cheng of Chu had set a precedent by detaining Duke Xiang of Song at a meeting, breaking diplomatic norms. King Zhao of Qin further defied the trust of the feudal lords by detaining King Huai. Over the three years of his detention, King Huai’s son, instead of seeking to rescue his father, proclaimed himself king, while the other states, deeming the matter irrelevant to their own interests, did not intervene. Unyielding in defending Chu’s interests, King Huai refused to cede territory, leaving Qin with neither land nor a pretext to attack. Three years later, King Huai died in Qin, and his coffin was returned to Chu, where "the Chu people grieved for him as if he were a relative." Ultimately, Qin was destroyed by Xiang Yu, a descendant of Chu nobles who famously declared, "Even if only three households remain in Chu, Qin will be overthrown by Chu." The "Righteous King" (Yidi) that Xiang Yu supported was also named "King Huai of Chu," a reflection of Chu’s enduring resentment toward Qin’s treachery.  

While the Six States’ joint campaigns against Qin contained elements of collective punishment for evil, their efforts were insufficient. Their motivations were neither pure nor resolute enough to be decisive. I do not criticize the Six States, for in such a complex political landscape, unless their entire populations had attained a profound ideological awakening—at minimum, understanding the principles outlined in this book and foreseeing their future—they could not have acted differently. Ideological limitations left most states with only the choices of "immediate destruction," "destruction tomorrow," or "destruction the day after." Qin, by contrast, chose to drive itself to madness, annihilate all rivals, and then collapse from within. This reveals that by the late Warring States period, the strength of the "Group Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism Mechanism" was waning, while the gains of direct Grabbingism outstripped the fragile cooperative ties of hypocritical groups—all states engaged in open strife, with no genuine cooperation. As we discussed in the context of individual Adversarial Evolution, Hypocrisyism is destined to be outcompeted by Grabbingism; this principle holds equally in group-level Adversarial Evolution. Thus, extreme Grabbingist groups like Qin rose to prominence under these evolutionary pressures.  

### The Evolutionary Crisis  
Qin’s unification of China, followed by the Chu-Han Contention and Liu Bang’s establishment of the Han dynasty, had its glorious aspects, but it also masked an evolutionary tragedy on the East Asian continent. Fortunately, from the ritual-ordered world of the Zhou Rites, to Confucian ideals of Great Harmony, to socialism and communism, the ancient Chinese nation has retained a pronounced sense of the "human community of life." While "community of life" may be less familiar, "Community of Shared Future for Mankind" is a term widely recognized. This concept, enshrined in China’s Constitution by the 13th National People’s Congress in March 2018, emphasizes pursuing national interests while respecting others’ legitimate concerns and promoting common development. It encompasses interdependent views of international power, shared interests, sustainable development, and global governance.  

In comparison, Western peoples have been relatively fortunate. During similar periods of contention, though Greece declined due to Grabbingist infighting between Athens and Sparta, Rome defeated Carthage (Hannibal), a rare victory of cooperation over Grabbingism. This laid the institutional foundation for Western democracy, the rule of law, and other cooperative ascensions. If, in the 21st century, human supergroups remain trapped in the low-dimensional mindset of "no permanent friends, only permanent interests," the future of human civilization will be perilous. Humanity’s technological advancement has reached new heights, but the absence of commensurate political and administrative mechanisms is not merely stagnation—it is a growing danger.  

Since prehistoric times, humans have established Virtue Selection Mechanisms, achieving the most dazzling feats in the biological world. However, the spirit of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism has likely been eroding over history, driven by two primary factors. First, Hypocrisyism has become increasingly indistinguishable—hypocrites operate at the edges of law and in the shadows of morality. As the saying goes, "As the Tao (virtue) advances a foot, the Devil (evil) advances a yard"; Grabbingism has found ways to evade Virtue Selection. Second, intensifying group competition has favored Grabbingist ruling classes, which have gained genetic advantages, propagating their Grabbingist tendencies.  

Facing this Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma, humanity has yet to find truly effective solutions. The Virtue Selection Mechanism faces mounting challenges, and its old closed loop teeters on the brink of collapse—a root cause of much human suffering, struggle, and conflict. The emergence of Virtue Selection ignited the dawn of human civilization, distinguishing humanity from other species. It provided the soil for human wisdom to grow, allowing us to first truly appreciate the cycles of flowers and birdsong, to feel love and gratitude, and even to develop the extraordinary capacity for self-reflection. It enabled fragile carbon-based life to first glimpse cosmic stars, probe atomic quarks, and view our blue planet—and ourselves—from a third-person perspective, discerning both our greatness and our smallness. Yet against the Adversarial Evolution of Hypocrisyism and group Grabbingism, its prospects are uncertain. It demands a new phase of elevation and transformation, and this time, natural selection cannot be relied upon to complete the process. [Humanity now wields power sufficient to annihilate itself and even the very nature that has "urged" our progress through ages of selection.]  

This may prove the greatest—and most perilous—Dimension Ascension event in the history of life, one likely to be driven by humanity’s unique [capacity for self-reflection and rationality]. This book merely begins the exploration. Since the laws of Adversarial Evolution and Dimension Ascension govern all known life forms, they must also apply to human groups, societies, and civilizations, thereby becoming the root causes of corporate, social, and even civilizational "diseases." [Human civilization is an intermediate state in life’s fifth Dimension Ascension, a supergroup of life—and indeed, a high-dimensional life form in its entirety.] Society is life; civilization is life. How can we prevent this life form from Individual Cancerization? How to halt the internal Grabbingist (involutionary) trends? How to resist and harness the natural laws of Adversarial Evolution? How to achieve Dimension Ascension? These will be the critical, existential questions for the next phase of human civilization.
