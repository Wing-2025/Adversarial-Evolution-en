# The Decline of Hypocrisyism: The Causal Cycle of Adversarial Evolution【★】

### Hypocrisyism’s Nemesis: Grabbingism  
Hypocrisyism is a typical product of Adversarial Evolution. Without Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, Hypocrisyism would lose its evolutionary motivation and rationale. In the natural world beyond human society, no organism invests survival resources in “pretending to be virtuous”—“posturing” yields no benefits for them. Hypocrisyism itself requires enormous costs—compared to overt Grabbingism, Hypocrisyism faces more constraints and expends more energy. Therefore, without Virtue-Upholders, Hypocrisyists would be eliminated by pure Grabbingists. Grabbingists care not whether you are truly virtuous or fake; looting and pillaging are far easier than deception.  

In fact, even in groups dominated by the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, Hypocrisyists find it hard to thrive, for personal grudges are relatively easy to clarify, making deception less likely. Yet the measurement of Virtue and Evil pertains to the long-term interests of the entire group, which is far more difficult to weigh than “grudges.” Thus, in a sense, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism is more “deceivable” than the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism. As the saying goes, “To deceive a dog, you need a real meat pie; to deceive a human, a painted pie suffices.” Therefore, Hypocrisyism only emerges in groups with a large number of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individuals. The altruism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism provides operational space for Hypocrisyists, who can gain enormous benefits through deception and “posturing.”  

When Hypocrisyists have nearly reverse-selected all Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individuals, and higher-order Hypocrisyists have eliminated lower-order ones, Hypocrisyists themselves will then face elimination by more pure Grabbingists—robbers, hooligans, and gangs will replace them as the protagonists of the next phase.  

### The Most Feared: Cultured Hooligans  
This scenario has occurred countless times in human history, manifesting in the late stages of both the Roman Empire and various Chinese dynasties. However, I intend to elaborate on these details in the chapter on the Law of Imperial Rise and Fall in the next volume. Here, we take an example from modern history, which benefits from a shorter time span and clearer facts, avoiding unnecessary disputes.  

Albania, once a socialist ally, was among China’s closest friends and a strong supporter of China’s return to the United Nations. Yet this once-promising nation was ruined by a “fraudulent president.” Dr. Berisha, a medical graduate, witnessed the 1989 upheavals in Eastern Europe, which Albania could not escape. He lamented, “Medicine cannot save the Albanian people,” and thus decided to enter politics and become president himself.  

Berisha campaigned with无赖 tactics—bribery and coercion won him many elections, but he also lost several. For every election he won, he boasted of fairness and justice; for every loss, he slandered opponents for fraud and incited supporters to violent protests, forcing re-elections. Thus, Berisha ascended to the presidency.

Upon taking office, he fabricated charges to purge his political rivals—senior leaders of the Labor Party. In subsequent years, the Albanian government fostered domestic financial groups to orchestrate Ponzi Schemes with high interest rates, siphoning vast amounts of private funds. Under the government’s inaction, an already poor populace abandoned productive work, daydreaming of quick wealth; one-third of the nation participated in this Ponzi Scheme’s “musical chairs.” To appease the public, Berisha claimed Albania was forging a “path to national success” and “people’s capitalism,” asserting “Albanian money is the cleanest.”  

By 1997, the Ponzi Scheme collapsed. Massive bank runs ensued, but it was too late—leaders of the financial groups fled with the funds. Public anger turned on the government, which had colluded with the financial groups. The national army crumbled; citizens seized weapons, occupying cities and armories. President Berisha and the defense minister fled abroad. Albania descended into anarchy.  

Chaotic civil war shattered domestic order and affected neighboring states. In 1997, the UN deployed forces to quell the unrest. After Berisha’s “hypocritical” reign, Albania became a haven for gangs, infamous for violence, cruelty, and inhumanity. Drug trafficking, illegal immigration, human smuggling, and arms dealing became their profit models. They lured and trafficked young women from Eastern Europe to Western Europe, selling people and abuse videos via the dark web at marked prices. This nation, destroyed by hypocrisy, degenerated into a criminal paradise where Grabbingism reigned.  

There is an old saying: “Hooligans are not fearsome; what’s fearsome is a hooligan with culture.” This means that an orderly society grounded in Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism fears not overt robbers and criminals, but cultured hooligans (who are essentially Hypocrisyists). Whom do cultured hooligans fear? They fear true hooligans—those who disregard rules, honor, and life, who are crueler, more shameless, and more reckless. By then, social order has been destroyed by Hypocrisyism, and the defenses of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism are in tatters. No one remains to protect their safety, degenerating into the “survival of the fittest” Hobbesian Jungle State.  

### The Cycle of Adversarial Evolution  
Having discussed these genetic strategies, we can now outline their evolutionary hierarchy of restraint:

Their evolutionary sequence follows as shown above. Note that this diagram reflects the cyclical restraint and adversarial evolution inherent in these genetic strategies, forming a critical theoretical foundation for the next volume’s exploration of the Law of Imperial Rise and Fall and the Law of Historical Cycles:

Hypocrisyism poses a massive and fatal threat to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, akin to Free-Riderism infiltrating a purely altruistic group. Hypocrisyists do not directly attack other Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individuals; instead, they enhance their own broad fitness through deception, indirectly eliminating others. They disable the Virtue Selection mechanism and dismantle the cooperative systems formed by Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. [Once Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting individuals are nearly eradicated, Hypocrisyists lose their host, just as parasites lose their hosts, and are then eliminated by more thorough Grabbingists. Mild Grabbingists are in turn replaced by more severe, radical Grabbingists, ultimately degenerating the group into the Hobbesian Jungle State where “everyone is an enemy to everyone.”]()

In some corner of this Hobbesian Jungle, the next rise of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting groups may laboriously take root, or this may mark humanity’s final chapter.
