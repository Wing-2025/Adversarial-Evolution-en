# Countering the Grand Dao Through Petty Virtue—The Winning Tactic of Hypocrites  

In Chinese culture, individuals of noble character and impeccable moral conduct are referred to as *junzi* (noble persons). In fact, the concept of *junzi* highly overlaps with that of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism." For simplicity, we may consider virtue-upholding and evil-rejecting individuals as *junzi*. Correspondingly, "Hypocrisyism" can be broadly equated with the concept of "hypocritical *junzi*." Mr. Wu Si has provided a vivid account of hypocritical *junzi*, which is excerpted as follows:  

Hypocrites are not made overnight; they require certain special "abilities." Mr. Wu Si summarized: "A base character like a slave, a flattering smile like a prostitute, a heartless greed for exploiting the people, a glib tongue like a matchmaker, and patience in handling official documents—in short, a repertoire of unsightly traits." Yet these are merely basic skills; excelling at them qualifies one as a "junior" hypocrite at best. What truly defines a hypocrite is the ability to act immorally while standing on the moral high ground.  

### Moral Coercion, Cherry-Picking, and Magnifying Minor Issues  

Qian Neng was a renowned eunuch during the Chenghua and Hongzhi reigns. There was once a wealthy man who unfortunately contracted leprosy. His son, known for filial piety, was deeply concerned about his father’s condition. Qian Neng summoned this filial son and declared: "Your father’s leprosy is contagious; if it spreads to the military, it will be catastrophic. Moreover, he is already old. After deliberation, we have decided to drown him in Dianchi Lake." The son, terrified, immediately thought of bribery (a habitual mindset ingrained in our culture). After much effort, he spent a large sum of money and repeatedly pleaded, finally securing the revocation of the decision through higher authorities’ leniency.  

Another incident also involved Qian Neng: In the second year of Emperor Hongzhi’s reign, Zhou Shicong, a Deputy Director of the Ministry of Revenue (Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Finance), submitted a memorial requesting legal punishment for former court evildoers such as Wang Zhi and Qian Neng, while also proposing evaluations of garrison eunuchs in the capital and regional areas. Facing this collective threat, the eunuch clique retaliated swiftly. They scrutinized Zhou Shicong’s memorial and identified an error in formatting. Traditionally, when mentioning revered terms such as "emperor," "ancestors," "state," or "sovereignty," one must start a new line, indented to the top—similar to how the most important directives were printed in bold during the Cultural Revolution. In Zhou Shicong’s memorial, "sovereignty" failed to follow this formatting rule. Was this not an act of disrespect toward the sovereignty? Zhou Shicong was thus arrested and handed over to judicial authorities for punishment, allowing Qian Neng to remain unscathed.  

Similarly, Li Linfu orchestrated three major cases during the Tianbao era: the cases of Wei Jian and Huangfu Weiming, Du Youlin, and Wang Zhongsi—all aimed at eliminating political rivals. Such examples of leveraging moral pretexts, magnifying minor issues, and finding fault to exclude adversaries while engaging in despicable acts are ubiquitous in Chinese history. [Hypocrites do not act brazenly or forcefully; instead, they present themselves as reasonable and articulate. However, their "reason" is derived from cherry-picking classical texts and twisting logic. These "principles" are also subject to immediate revocation or adoption based on their needs. In their hands, "morality" becomes a weapon that kills without drawing blood.]()  

### Literary Inquisitions [Excerpt]  

A common misconception about the Qing literary inquisitions is that they stemmed entirely from Manchu efforts to control Han thought, driven by Manchu-Han ethnic conflicts. This is inaccurate. According to surviving Qing archives, most literary inquisitions were triggered by personal grudges or extortion-driven denunciations among Han people, with Manchu-Han tensions often serving as a pretext for such denunciations. A typical example is the "Zhuang Family History Case" in the early Kangxi reign.  

The "Zhuang Family History Case" was a significant event in Qing history. Jin Yong (Louis Cha) drew inspiration from this case for the opening chapter of his novel *The Deer and the Cauldron*: "The Turmoil of Pure Officials in Factional Struggles / The Critique of Scholars in Frosty Wind." The "Zhuang Family History Case" ranks among the most notorious literary inquisitions of the Qing Dynasty, unparalleled in scale and severity in Chinese history.  

From the late Ming to early Qing, the Zhuang family was a prominent clan in the Suhu region of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. During the Shunzhi reign, literati in Jiangnan, "ashamed of the loss of national history and resolute in taking responsibility," popularized the practice of privately compiling Ming histories. Zhuang Yincheng and his son Zhuang Tinglong were among those involved in this trend. They acquired a manuscript of *A General History of the Ming Dynasty* by Zhu Guozhen from the late Ming, recruited scholars to copy, revise, and expand it, and ultimately produced *Records of the Ming History*—a 120-volume work spanning over 9,000 pages. After its publication, the book drew no attention from the Manchus or the Qing court; instead, it caught the eye of certain Han ruffians.  

Gu Yanwu’s *On the Affairs of Pan and Wu* records: The Zhuang family was extremely wealthy, and Zhejiang locals who purchased the book often used it to blackmail the Zhuang family, each time extracting a sum of money. Coincidentally, Wu Zhirong, a magistrate of Gui’an County in Huzhou who had been imprisoned for embezzlement and exploitation, was released during a general amnesty. A subordinate advised him to purchase the book and use it to blackmail the Zhuang family. The Zhuang family initially intended to pay to resolve the issue but later refused Wu Zhirong’s threats, recognizing that such extortionists would never cease and that "buying peace" was not a long-term solution.  

Wu Zhirong reported the matter to local officials at various levels, but to no avail. He then traveled all the way to the capital at his own expense to denounce the Zhuang family, finally succeeding: "Upon arriving in the capital, Wu Zhirong secretly reported the book’s problematic content to the court. The four regents in power were enraged, dispatching officials to Hangzhou to arrest 18 individuals listed in the book, including Zhuang Tinglong’s father, his elder brother Zhuang Tingyue, and other relatives—all sentenced to death. Those involved in printing, selling, and local officials who failed to report the book were also implicated. Zhuang Tinglong’s grave was exhumed, his family assets confiscated, and over 70 people were executed."  

Although the "Zhuang Family History Case" was partially linked to Ming loyalist sentiments among some Han literati, its root cause lay in Wu Zhirong’s denunciation—driven entirely by his desire to extort money, with no connection to Han ethnic pride or loyalty to the Qing Dynasty. This was not an isolated incident. Huang Shang’s *Essays on the History of Literary Persecutions* notes: "If we tally them, most Qing literary inquisitions—excluding those discovered by the emperor, reported by officials, or self-incriminated due to misunderstanding—were motivated by personal grudges or extortion."  

Huang Shang cited the Qi family literary inquisition in Shanyin during the early Qing as an example. In this case, the denunciator, Kong Mengwen, initially sought to extort money. When he first reported the case to officials like the Zhejiang governor, he omitted the real names of the involved individuals. After his extortion failed, Kong Mengwen provided their true names and addresses, prompting General Ke Kui of Zhejiang to secretly arrest them. "The outcome of this case was: three executions, multiple others sentenced to death, and several families’ assets confiscated." All of this stemmed from a single Han individual’s greed to extort his "fellow countrymen."  

Similar scenarios unfolded during the later Cultural Revolution, where hypocrites excelled at over-politicizing issues and distorting legitimate reasons to attack adversaries.
