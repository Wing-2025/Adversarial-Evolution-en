# The Unstoppable Trend of Hypocrisyism—"PUA" and "Scumbags" Flourishing Together【★】  

### The Form of Hypocrisy in the Old Era  
"Hypocrites" are by no means a unique product of China; they represent a prominent trend emerging after humanity's remarkable success in the biological world. However, it is difficult to find, on a global scale, a hypocritical group as large in scale, as "professionally skilled," and as collusive as those in China's feudal dynasties. Mr. Wu Si, in his article "Law of the New Official's Degeneration" (collected in *Hidden Rules*), provides a brilliant exposition: "For every new official, they will receive two forms of education. The first is the education of sages and worthies, which instills lofty moral principles. The second is the education from petty officials, yamen runners, and the 'university of human experience,' which teaches them to act with duplicity and greed." What is more alarming than mere education is the invisible "hand" in the feudal officialdom that compels people to become hypocrites. If one refuses to "conform," they are easily expelled from the clique. As Mr. Bei Dao once said: "Baseness is the passport of the base; nobility is the epitaph of the noble"; Wu Si noted: "The boundaries of justice always age"; and Chairman Mao stated: "If Heaven had emotions, it too would grow old; the right path on earth is fraught with vicissitudes." This is profoundly reflected in China's feudal officialdom. From the perspective of China's feudal history, there were indeed numerous hypocrites, which is partially related to China's geographical environment—a topic to be elaborated in the subsequent volume.  

### PUA—A High-Order Hypocritical Behavior  
I believe most are now familiar with the term "PUA" (Pick-Up Artist). Initially referring to "the art of seduction," PUA now broadly denotes behaviors that employ brainwashing and psychological manipulation to achieve self-serving ends, which is also termed the "gaslighting effect" in psychology. This phenomenon is not confined to romantic relationships; it occurs between superiors and subordinates in the workplace, among classmates, and even within families. It also serves as the core principle behind the operations of pyramid schemes and criminal gangs.

Have you ever wondered what underpins PUA? Why do no other creatures exhibit such behavior? In fact, PUA is rooted in human cooperative relationships. The closer and more interdependent a cooperative relationship, the greater the possibility and feasibility of PUA. To put it bluntly: Why are we subjected to PUA? Because we "like" to be PUA'd. To be even blunter: Due to our inclination to accept PUA, the world at large tends to "PUA" us. This is dictated by the laws of Adversarial Evolution. In the evolutionary process of human cooperation, there is an innate "compromising" tendency—a willingness to sacrifice or cede personal interests to maintain a benign "cooperative relationship" and thereby generate greater cooperative dividends. For instance, "Kong Rong yielding the pear" exemplifies a traditionally recognized virtue. Additionally, empathy is another cooperative ability of humans. Those with strong empathy care deeply about others' feelings and find it hard to say "no." When interacting with others, they avoid conflict and discomfort even if it means enduring personal suppression. Furthermore, self-reflection and guilt are invaluable cooperative capacities, enabling humans to acknowledge their mistakes, compensate for others' losses, and sustain cooperative relationships. Finally, trust is a prerequisite for human cooperation. If we instinctively assume everyone to be malicious, cooperation becomes nearly impossible. Thus, in highly cooperative groups, the baseline level of mutual trust is relatively high.  

What, then, is PUA? It is precisely a strategy that leverages these uniquely human "cooperative capacities" and emerges through Adversarial Evolution. To clarify, if humans lacked compromise, empathy, self-reflection, guilt, or trust, PUA would not exist. Let us examine common PUA tactics:  

[Psychological Suggestion]. Manipulators gather fragmented but real information, then string these snippets together to construct a narrative favorable to their goals. They guide the target to infer the desired conclusion through implied logic.  

[Repetition and Exaggeration]. They repeatedly reinforce the same logic from various angles, gradually embedding the falsehood into the target’s mind. As the Goebbels Effect suggests, a lie repeated a hundred times may become accepted as truth. Examples include: "Who else cares for you like I do?"; "No one loves you more than I do in this world"; "Only I will want you, only I will treat you this well forever." Repeated emphasis and distortion of truth are highly effective in planting conclusions into the target’s subconscious—a tactic as old as the "Zeng Zi Killed Someone" anecdote.  

[Deliberate Belittlement and Moral Coercion]. Manipulators deliberately belittle, undermine, and negate the target to establish their own authority, making the target believe they are always right. This often occurs in workplace PUA, such as nitpicking and criticizing subordinates, even if the criticism is unfounded or later proven wrong. Additionally, moral coercion activates the target’s self-reflection, guilt, or even sense of guilt, commonly seen in romantic relationships. The manipulated may think: "Maybe I was wrong"; "I owe him this"; "It was my fault for making him angry."  

[Triggering Compassion]. The foundation of PUA lies in the target’s willingness to compromise. The essence of PUA is to threaten the termination of the cooperative relationship (e.g., "Let’s part ways") to coerce the target into sacrificing personal interests. If the target refuses to compromise on unreasonable demands or accusations, PUA cannot proceed. In some cases, manipulators even fabricate a persona of suffering to trigger the target’s compassion or maternal instincts, thereby lowering their psychological defenses.  

[Push-Pull]. Manipulators intermittently offer small favors to elicit gratitude and认同感. Once the target is hooked, they grow distant, inducing frustration and alternating between happiness and disappointment. The target, consumed by this turmoil, cannot pinpoint the issue. This suffering ultimately stems from the threat of losing "cooperative dividends."  

From these PUA tactics, it is clear that if a person trusts no one and remains vigilant, they will not be swayed by psychological suggestions or repeated lies. If they refuse to compromise or feel compassion, they will not be intimidated or lower their defenses. If they lack self-reflection or guilt, they will not be affected by belittlement. If they are overly self-interested and unwilling to cede any personal interests to sustain cooperation, they will incur no losses. Such a person would be entirely immune to PUA. Therefore, PUA is a strategic form parasitic on human "cooperative capacities" (virtuous capacities). It is a "hypocritical" behavior that emerges through Adversarial Evolution, exploiting human "goodwill."  

It should be noted that some PUA scenarios arise when the target seeks to exploit the manipulator through "unequal cooperation," leading to their own victimization. They may recognize the scam but are lured by the promise of excessive returns, such as in pyramid schemes or P2P investment Ponzi schemes, which prey on gambling mentalities. In such cases, the target bears some responsibility, so we should avoid pursuing "unequal cooperation" and exercise moderation. However, I believe such self-aware PUA scenarios are not truly PUA.  

### PUA Culture in Fan Circles  
Broadly speaking, hypocritical tactics like PUA, which exploit human goodwill, are increasingly being selected through Adversarial Evolution. Take fan circle culture, for example. It leverages the hero complex, the desire for love, and the notion that voting and ranking for idols are sources of pride. Failing to spend money on idols is deemed shameful, and not contributing financially labels one a "free-riding fan." The underlying logic of fan circles is transference psychology, where personal achievement is projected onto idols—their success becomes the fan’s own. This was crucial in humanity’s early stages, as it amplified the influence of outstanding individuals, facilitating unity, defense, and the enhancement of group cooperation to secure greater cooperative dividends.  

Fan circles also exploit herd mentality, a manifestation of human cooperative capacity. Conforming to collective consciousness aligns the group’s actions, often amplifying its strength. However, this mentality is easily exploited by hypocrites. For instance, given choices A and B, manipulators can make everyone believe "everyone" chooses A. Even if individuals prefer B, herd mentality leads them to select A. In reality, everyone succumbs, violating both personal and collective will. They then fabricate justifications to convince themselves that choosing A is correct. In essence, they seek to fit in and build consensus with friends, only to be collectively PUA’d. This represents a high-order PUA tactic, and such methods are being mastered by an increasing number of people.

Within fan circles, what individuals truly pursue in their hearts are profoundly beautiful ideals: moments of emotional resonance, passionate devotion, a sense of achievement, empowering connections, and the affirmation of personal worth. Yet it is precisely these heartfelt yearnings that hypocrisyists in the star-making industry exploit to reap profits. These manipulative hypocrisyists frequently employ moral coercion to achieve their objectives. For instance, when fans fall short in "ranking efforts" (promoting their idol's popularity), professional fans may harshly criticize them: "Your idol has low popularity and poor sales—how could you be so inadequate?" In their hands, idol-chasing is distorted into a narrative where "one isn’t truly chasing an idol without spending money, and one isn’t a real fan without making monetary contributions."  

Fan circle manipulators further project their PUA tactics onto broader society. Through rankings, trending topics, and other mechanisms, they continuously disseminate the "spiritual opiates" they manufacture into society at large to reap enormous profits. Some may argue that those manipulated by PUA have only themselves to blame—only excessively naive or foolish individuals would leave themselves vulnerable to such tactics. Yet such assertions are facile and unempathetic. It is true that hard-hearted individuals are less susceptible to PUA, but research shows that those with strong empathy, trusting natures, and even high intelligence are more vulnerable to PUA manipulation. Of course, those who exploit this environment to seek fame and profit are a separate case.  

We must therefore dissect the internal logic of PUA, strengthen our ideological defenses, and strive to prevent PUA from infiltrating while preserving our "cooperative capacity"—a task of immense difficulty. Yet we have no retreat, for if we abandon love, compassion, trust, and goodwill, humanity ceases to be human. PUA incidents are, in essence, microcosms of the evolutionary reverse selection and dimensional collapse caused by hypocrisyism, phenomena we will explore later. To avoid PUA by abandoning "cooperative capacity"—the very capacity upon which human success and prosperity depend—would mark the onset of another tragedy. The correct approach is to eliminate these cancerous elements and prevent their proliferation and metastasis.  


### Reverse Sexual Selection and the Proliferation of "Bad Boys" and "Bad Girls"  

When people discuss PUA, they immediately associate it with "bad boys," recalling incidents like the tragic case of Bao Li. Yet hypocritical women are equally perilous; the Su Xiangmao incident, for example, is likely familiar to many. Exploiting "gender dividends" to engage in ambiguous relationships, deceiving, and exploiting men are not uncommon. Personal accounts of such experiences are readily found on platforms like Zhihu.  

I strongly oppose framing this as a "gender-based class perspective" that pits men and women against one another. In most cases, such factional tactics serve ulterior motives. In reality, both men and women contain wicked individuals and malicious intentions—commonly referred to as "bad boys" and "bad girls." The theory I aim to advance here is that "bad girls" select for "bad boys," and "bad boys" select for "bad girls."  

Consider a "bad boy" who feels a perverse sense of accomplishment for mistreating numerous women over his lifetime. His descendants are likely to face intensified "retribution" from "bad girls." The logic is simple: women harmed by him (like Bao Li) experience a significant reduction in fitness. Consequently, women who are more trusting, compassionate, willing to initiate efforts (commonly labeled as "love-obsessed"), self-reflective, and ashamed of wrongdoing gradually diminish. What remains are women who are more calculating, distrustful, paranoid, unashamed, and profit-driven—these gain greater room to thrive.  

The same dynamic applies to "bad girls." Honest, upright, responsible men who are willing to initiate efforts (like Su Xiangmao) diminish in number due to harm inflicted by "bad girls." Conversely, irresponsible, superficially attractive men who deceive women increase in number.  

More alarming is the emergence of "reverse sexual selection." Men who specialize in deceiving women often gain genetic advantages, which in turn confer advantages to genes that "prefer bad boys." This alters the trajectory of female sexual selection, explaining the mechanism behind the adage "women love men who are not 'good.'"  

Even as women carrying these "prefer bad boys" genes suffer tremendously at the hands of bad boys, they refuse to change course until hitting rock bottom. This is because their offspring’s "genetic advantages" are remarkably strong—the genes of "bad boys" facilitate the spread of sexual selection genes (i.e., the "prefer bad boys" genes). When these "bad boys" and "bad girls" encounter more advanced manipulators of their kind, they too lead lives of great hardship and danger. Love-hate dynamics emerge, transforming romance into an endless nightmare. Ultimately, human society descends into a quagmire of mutual grabbing-driven degeneration.  

"Bad boys" select for "bad girls," and "bad girls" select for "bad boys"—a cyclical process that forms a dynamic of dual adversarial evolution, where each drives the other’s proliferation. When women lament why there are so many "bad boys," "bad girls" share the responsibility; when men lament why there are so many "bad girls," "bad boys" have created the situation. Those who frame this as a gender conflict have been led astray by those with ulterior motives. This is not a battle between men and women. It is a tragedy of adversarial evolution—its essence is a contest between virtue and evil, the withering of beautiful love, and a microcosm of humanity’s descent into hypocrisyism and grabbingism.
