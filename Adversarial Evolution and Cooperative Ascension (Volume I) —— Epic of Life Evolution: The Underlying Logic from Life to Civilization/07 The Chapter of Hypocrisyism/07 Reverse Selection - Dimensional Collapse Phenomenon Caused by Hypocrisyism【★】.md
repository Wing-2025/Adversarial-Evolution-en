# Reverse Selection—The Phenomenon of Dimensional Collapse Triggered by Hypocrisyism【★】

### "I Stand to Your Left, Yet It Feels Like a Galactic Chasm Separates Us"—Individual Alienation Caused by Hypocrisyism  

In groups teeming with hypocrisyists, deception becomes a norm and manipulation a habit. Virtuous individuals are continuously eliminated. Over time, integrity, trust, compassion, conscience, and justice all decline to varying degrees. Love degenerates into possession and exploitation; people no longer act with sincerity to help others. They grow self-serving, fixated on taking advantage of others, and luring others with small benefits becomes an effective means of profit. People calculate against each other while being on guard against others’ calculations. In this phase dominated by hypocrisyists, it is all about scheming, acting skills, and the thickness of one’s moral boundaries. First-order hypocrisyists are outmatched by second-order ones, who in turn are outmatched by third-order ones. Hypocrisyists who fall prey to others often lament, “The shameless truly have no rivals.” Yet the reality is that even more hypocritical and despicable individuals will emerge.  

Take the case of Zhu Weiping, a disgraced corrupt official. He embezzled huge sums to curry favor with his mistress Shen Hong, hoping she would intercede with her other lover—a deputy governor—to advance his political career. However, like a mantis stalking a cicada unaware of the oriole behind, Shen Hong was merely an imposter claiming to be the governor’s lover. She simultaneously deceived multiple officials using the same method, profiting from each. Zhu Weiping, upon learning the truth, was filled with regret. Another example is Zhang Li, a wealthy man from Fujian, who sought to leverage model Zheng Jiaxin to align himself with powerful figures for personal gain. Zheng colluded with an accomplice to fabricate a persona: “Aifeng,” the daughter of a central leader and ex-wife of Bill Gates. Exploiting Zhang Li’s eagerness to climb the social ladder, they defrauded him of 9.3431 million yuan, along with luxury watches, phones, diamond rings, and other items by luring him to purchase expensive gifts, undergo cosmetic procedures, and give cash.  

The miracle of love that humans take pride in and depend on also disintegrates in this phase. As previously discussed, romantic relationships between genders represent the most miraculous and fundamental unit of cross-genetic division of labor and cooperation in humanity, underpinning the origin and prosperity of human civilization. Recalling the discussion in the chapter on Grabbingism, the mutual exploitation in the gender relationships of other animal species dooms those species to being unable to ascend in dimensions or develop civilization. The most touching, heart-wrenching acts of devotion and sacrifice portrayed in countless films and dramas occur between genders; so too do the most loathsome deceptions and manipulations. Thus, whether gender relations are based on love or on possession and exploitation, on cooperative division of labor or on each pursuing their own maximal self-interest, serves as a barometer of a civilization’s dimensional state. The state of gender alienation is aptly captured by the lyric, “I stand to your left, yet it feels like a galactic chasm separates us.” True love is the bond linking genders in a high-dimensional state; when this bond breaks, the high-dimensional state cannot be sustained.  

### Dimensional Collapse and Exhaustion of Cooperative Dividends  

In this phase, Han Fei’s Legalist theories become eerily applicable: “Even the closest of spouses and dearest of children cannot be trusted.” “The ruler keeps ministers through calculation, and ministers serve the ruler through calculation; the relationship between ruler and minister is based on calculation.” Ruler and minister “fight a hundred battles in a single day.” In such a group, everyone is isolated—spouses and children cannot be trusted, nor can superiors or subordinates. Daily life becomes a game of constant scheming. Internal strife is severe, and cooperative dividends are completely exhausted.  

Once the group’s capacity for cooperation is utterly lost, hypocrisyists lose their hosts and degenerate into pure grabbingists. Society ultimately regresses into a Hobbesian Jungle where everyone is an enemy to everyone else. However, before this phase fully arrives, the decaying community is typically replaced by younger, virtue-upholding and evil-rejecting groups. Fundamentally, this is a process of Dimensional Collapse.  

As previously discussed, compassion, trust, and love are the “pain receptors” of the “human community,” forging connections, empathy, and shared fates among individuals. Justice, on the other hand, is the “immune cell” of the human community, defending against grabbingists and preventing the proliferation of hypocrisyists. With these virtues, the human community functions as a cohesive whole, achieving a high degree of division of labor and cooperation to form a higher-dimensional life form—a towering “giant” standing tall. Cooperative dividends for the group then undergo qualitative leaps.  

[When virtues wane, distort, or perish, the human community’s pain receptors shatter, immune cells deplete, and the Virtue Selection Mechanism malfunctions, allowing cancer cells to proliferate throughout. At this point, the towering “giant” collapses, and the human community falls from its fourth-dimensional pedestal, degenerating into a third-dimensional life form. Humans, accustomed to four-dimensional existence, are extremely vulnerable as third-dimensional life forms in nature, facing constant risk of extinction.]()  

Once we master cross-dimensional analogical thinking, the consequences of Dimensional Collapse become easy to imagine. When a three-dimensional animal undergoes Dimensional Collapse and degenerates to two dimensions, though each eukaryotic cell in its body could survive independently before the Cambrian Period hundreds of millions of years ago, eons of three-dimensional life have led to high cellular specialization and functional degradation. These cells can no longer survive independently in a two-dimensional state and thus perish rapidly as the animal dies. Similarly, humans, as four-dimensional life forms, cannot survive in isolation once the human community disintegrates. They are fated to perish as human society collapses dimensionally.

This process evokes the “two-dimensional foil” from *The Three-Body Problem*—to eliminate humanity as a four-dimensional life form, a single hypocrisyist gene with sufficiently sophisticated “acting skills” suffices. Once an individual carrying this gene is introduced into human society, driven by evolutionary forces, this “cancer cell” gene will rapidly infect the human group, causing human civilization to collapse dimensionally, disintegrate, and perish.

All of this unfolds automatically, requiring no earth-shattering energy or meticulous manipulation—only a single gene. Mastery and application of the laws of Adversarial Evolution may truly reflect the intellectual height of higher-dimensional civilizations.
