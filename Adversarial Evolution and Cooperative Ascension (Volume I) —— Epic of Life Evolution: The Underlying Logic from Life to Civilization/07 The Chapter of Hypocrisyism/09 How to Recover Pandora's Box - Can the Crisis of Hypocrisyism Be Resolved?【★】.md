# How to Close Pandora's Box—Can the Crisis of Hypocrisyism Be Resolved?【★】  
Although the previous section has discussed that Grabbingism is the terminator of Hypocrisyism, we certainly cannot hope that after all Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists are eliminated, Grabbingists will then eliminate Hypocrisyists. By that point, the human community would have already disintegrated, and the subsequent Hobbesian Jungle State is an outcome no one wishes to see. So, can the crisis of Hypocrisyism be resolved while maintaining the healthy operation of the human community? Let us explore this using the thinking mode of Cross-Dimensional Analogy.  

### A Ramble on Cross-Dimensional Analogy Thinking  
To contain the cancerous spread of Hypocrisyism, we might seem to pin our hopes on Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists sharpening their discernment to identify Hypocrisyists. However, this is in fact extremely difficult. Even though there have never been shortages of individuals who worry about the world’s troubles before others, Hypocrisyists possess exceptional disguising abilities, and combined with the "boiling frog" process, most people within the system do not easily awaken. At such times, entire nations (or ethnic groups) often become disoriented. They are not unaware of the danger, but they fail to recognize the root of the crisis. They observe superficial symptoms and adopt measures that "treat headaches by addressing the head and foot pain by addressing the foot" to alleviate discomfort; they are distracted by trivial daily matters and immediate interests. Without a sound theoretical framework to guide them, they cannot see that Hypocrisyism is spreading and gnawing at the system, creating countless festering holes. Eventually, the nation (or ethnic group) is driven step by step into the abyss of internal strife caused by Hypocrisyism, resulting in the depletion of loyal and virtuous individuals, the demise of far-sighted thinkers, and the fate of self-destruction or subjugation by foreign forces—by which time it is too late for realization.  

[This process is strikingly similar to someone developing cancer, which is precisely the horror of cancer—most cancer patients are only diagnosed at an advanced stage, when it is already too late to reverse.]()  

Can we prevent cancer at its source? Scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute published an article in the top journal *Cell Stem Cell*. Through a series of studies, these scientists discovered that for a 63-year-old patient first diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), the first JAK2 gene mutation occurred 44 years prior, when he was 19. For a second patient diagnosed with MPN at 34, the first oncogenic mutation occurred at age 9, 25 years prior. Thus, preventing cancer at its source is also nearly impossible, as errors in DNA replication occur with small but inevitable probabilities.

In reality, the challenge of Hypocrisyism is analogous: the seeds of Hypocrisyism are sown early, making it difficult to eliminate at the source. To date, the most effective known means of containing the spread of Hypocrisyism is—Group Selection. This is a controversial yet unavoidable topic, which we will explore in the next chapter. Even if Group Selection can contain Hypocrisyism, the process is extremely violent and bloody, akin to scraping bone to heal a wound or a determined person cutting off their own wrist. In fact, this process closely resembles the effects and side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on tumors.  

As is known, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were the most commonly used methods in past cancer treatment. However, these therapies lack "selectivity (targetedness)"—both healthy and cancerous cells are damaged. Of course, they are not entirely indiscriminate: rapidly proliferating cells are more sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy than slow-growing ones, and radiotherapy can also control the affected area. Yet, this is the extent of their discriminatory capacity. Once cancer cells metastasize, the localized approach of radiotherapy becomes ineffective, while chemotherapy inflicts varying degrees of damage on most cells in the body. Among these, periosteal cells, oral mucosal cells, and hair follicle cells are the first to be affected, as they are the body’s rapidly proliferating cells.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48cd11fd-538a-43a6-8466-b178bce60ab0" /></p>  

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are essentially therapies that "kill 800 enemies while losing 3,000 of one’s own." Worse still, both methods have low cure rates, especially for advanced-stage cancer. By this point, cancer cells have metastasized to various organs, and even under radiotherapy or chemotherapy, they are like wildfires that "burn不尽, 春风吹又生" (cannot be fully eradicated and regrow with favorable conditions).  

Of course, multicellular life, having evolved over hundreds of millions of years, has not entirely failed to counter "cancer." In fact, it has developed numerous strategies. First, the immune system itself is designed to eliminate cells that have mutated into dysfunctional states. However, "the magic advances as the dao (principle) advances": cancer cells are called "cancerous" precisely because they can evade the "law enforcement team’s" discerning gaze. Another example is tumor suppressor genes, which inhibit excessive cell growth and division. Additionally, multicellular life once invented an ultimate anti-cancer weapon—chromosomal telomeres, which shorten with each cell replication. Through this mechanism, each chromosome can be replicated at most 50–60 times in its lifetime, known as the "Hayflick limit." This prevents greedy cancer cells from infinite replication; at most 60 cancer cells arise in the body, causing negligible harm. Yet, this excellent mechanism has flaws: germ cells must bypass this limit to ensure the continuation of life across generations; similarly, certain hematopoietic cells and skin stem cells must exceed this limit to sustain normal life activities. Thus, cancer cells "learn" from these genes to break free—using telomerase to repair telomeres, thereby overcoming life’s constraints once more.

### Civilizational Ailment—An "Incurable Disease" of Four-Dimensional Life Forms  
Once Hypocrisyism genes spread widely, they are difficult to eliminate from within the system; they are hard to cure and only spread further. Thus, we observe that few long-lived civilizations exist on Earth. Whether the Sumerian, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Indian, Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, or Ancient Chinese civilizations, all have experienced a decline from peak prosperity and been gradually replaced by neighboring peoples. (Specific details will be elaborated in the next volume, the chapter "Laws of Imperial Rise and Fall.")  

In reality, human civilization is a continuation of life mechanisms, adhering to the fundamental laws of Adversarial Evolution. Thus, [civilization is life](). The underlying logic of society, civilization, and life discussed in this book is, in fact, the same logic—a set of nearly unified laws spanning the micro and macro scales.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18b4239d-5c36-4503-839d-75d113e67b1b" /></p>  

Before humanity deeply understood the theory of Adversarial Evolution, people speculated about the causes of national and ethnic rise and fall from various angles. This is akin to the era of limited medical knowledge, where a person’s death from an incurable disease would be attributed to complications or supernatural prophecies. Their limited understanding prevented them from recognizing the fundamental cause—the basic laws of Individual Cancerization. Even the cancer of three-dimensional life forms has left humanity perplexed, leading to "fear at the mention of cancer." In comparison, the "cancer" of four-dimensional life forms is far more terrifying, with destructive power and cruelty on an entirely different scale.  

[Although this "civilizational ailment" has occurred repeatedly, claiming the "lives" of numerous civilizations, it has yet to be discovered, acknowledged, or deeply studied.]()  

### One World, One Shared Challenge  
In the 21st century, various signs indicate that Hypocrisyism is deepening and spreading more widely. To some extent, it is indeed as Robert’s book title suggests: "Everyone is a hypocrite." High-level Hypocrisyists are increasingly unconstrained by morality and public opinion—they reap tangible benefits while operating in the gray areas of the law, their Grabbingist actions unregulated and unpunished.  

All manner of MLM organizations under the guise of "success studies," from large established enterprises to small P2P platforms, continue to stage ever-effective Ponzi Schemes. There are also male groups studying PUA tactics who treat love as a game, female groups attending "elite marriage training" who treat love as a profit tool, and models where live-streamers attract followers to recommend stocks, then manipulate the market to harvest "leeks." These new-age forms of Hypocrisyism emerge endlessly. More complex, covert, and harmful forms of Hypocrisyism exist in political and financial domains.  

In recent years, China has resolutely and steadfastly strengthened its anti-corruption efforts, which form a critical foundation for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This is highly commendable and deserves unwavering support. In contrast, the forces of Hypocrisyism in Western countries have "entered a mature phase." They have lost the vitality of their founding pioneers, and Hypocrisyism has taken root at the boundaries of their systems. Rigid institutions, lacking guidance from more advanced theories, can no longer constrain the success of high-level Hypocrisyists (one may refer to the stories of Jho Low, Najib Razak, and Goldman Sachs). Attempts to transplant "advanced systems" into nations where cancerous cells thrive have mostly ended in failure.  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef04b81a-1615-4e53-9d8b-221166637f01" /></p>

The United States, having a relatively short history since its founding, initially brimmed with vigor and prosperity. At that time, hypocritical vested interests were reluctant to take risks in a new nation, so those who truly ventured there were mostly individuals eager to carve out new futures through their own labor. Such a populace laid a solid moral foundation. It was this moral consciousness that led the United States to prioritize the rule of law, institutional innovation, and enterprising spirit. Some believe that good institutions can solve all problems, and the U.S. even once sought to export its "superior" systems to other countries. Yet most such attempts backfired, as seen in the failures in Libya and Afghanistan. Even the U.S. itself has now lost its former vitality. The root cause lies in a commonly overlooked premise: institutions are grounded in morality and the genetic composition of a people. Only when advanced moral outlooks are paired with rationality can good laws and institutions emerge—and only then can they be sustained. Hypocrisyism, the shadow behind all national ascents, has proven difficult to evade even for the U.S. At this historical juncture of shifting fortunes, the Chinese nation bears both the mission to transcend its millennia-old cycles and the responsibility to lead humanity out of its predicament.  

### Tentative Conclusions  
This book covers a vast array of ideas, and drawing final conclusions is premature. Yet we must keep one principle in mind: the simple moral judgments encoded in human genes are no longer sufficient. We must deeply understand the principles governing virtue and its role in human society; we must also recognize the crises virtue faces under the pressures of Adversarial Evolution, so as to derive new, scientific moral outlooks adapted to the modern era. We must remain vigilant: under the pressures of Adversarial Evolution, hypocritical tactics are being continuously refined—tactics that exploit our goodwill, old moral frameworks, and the bonds of affection, love, and trust forged within human cooperative systems. Examples abound.  

A psychological counselor once shared the story of a female client: married with children and a loving husband, the woman fell for a man who seemed to intuit her emotional subtleties, show concern, and rekindle the feeling of romance. They began an affair, and when the man revealed he owed debts, the woman gradually paid them off, under the agreement that they would divorce their spouses afterward. The outcome is all too familiar: once the debts were settled, the man distanced himself, leaving the woman to lose both love and money. Some might criticize her morally or call her naive, but these judgments miss the mark. In truth, she was exploited by a hypocrite. Romance, a profoundly human capacity, thrives on pursuing "high-level cooperation" and making necessary "self-sacrifices"—a key to our species' success. Unconsciously, the woman likely felt her original family lacked this "high-level cooperation," a void that pained her. When she encountered someone who seemed to offer that state of cooperation, she was willing to sacrifice love and money. The problem lies in the emergence of "romance fraudsters"—genetically selected individuals who hone their ability to feign affection. These individuals invest time and energy not in meaningful endeavors, but in perfecting deception. They exploit vulnerabilities to find "hosts" to parasitize. Those seeking true love pursue a cooperative state worthy of sacrifice—a noble aspiration, yet often met with cruelty. More often than not, they encounter hypocrites rather than genuine partners.  

The woman above fell prey to a low-level hypocrite. More shocking was the case of Hangzhou tour guide Yang Yin, who defrauded an 87-year-old Singaporean millionairess of her fortune. Yang ingratiated himself with the elderly woman, acting like a devoted "adopted son," while secretly isolating her from family and even using psychoactive drugs to manipulate her into rewriting her will—leaving hundreds of millions to him. Publicly, he feigned filial piety; privately, his social media revealed his true motives: "Let my treasure vault march toward 50 million," "Come on! Money, I Love You"—unashamed in his greed for ill-gotten gains!

Kind-hearted people, protect yourselves—it is critical for both your own sake and the common good. Self-protection not only preserves the number of virtuous individuals but also prevents hypocrites from profiting at your expense and stops you from becoming unwitting agents of "cancerous spread." Remember, regardless of gender: sharpen your discernment of virtue and evil; resist small temptations; never be lured by trivial favors; and uphold your capacity for independent thought. [Bear in mind: great deceivers appear kind, great villains feign loyalty, great traps masquerade as boons, great harms seem beneficial. Conversely, great love speaks softly, great righteousness may appear unfeeling, great benefits lack ostentation, and the great Way is formless.] Those "practical" truths that promise immediate success often do not help—they either lead you down an impossible shortcut or harm those around you, with consequences that will eventually rebound to your own genetic detriment. The ideas in this book may seem lengthy and abstract, but they offer the path to genuine, lasting success for you and those you care about.  

[Understanding, identifying, and preventing hypocrisyism is a critical task for humanity in this new evolutionary phase.] Traditional moral outlooks, honed over millennia, are powerless against this "new virus." [It is not that morality is irrelevant; rather, its forms have been deeply distorted and exploited.] The principles of morality remain vital—only by understanding these principles can we reconstruct new moral and legal frameworks. Moral instincts also remain crucial—they provide the driving force for advancing legal systems and upholding their enforcement. [The evolutionary dynamics of virtue and hypocrisyism should be studied as an academic discipline, deeply informing the development of "moral theory" and "legal theory." Basic education should include courses on discerning character and recognizing people.] This book’s theory of Adversarial Evolution provides the foundational framework to grasp these essences.  

Only by doing so can we preserve humanity’s most precious virtues—love, trust, compassion, justice—while sustaining high-efficiency cooperation and reaping massive cooperative dividends, all the while preventing hypocrites from exploiting vulnerabilities and safeguarding the high-dimensional human community from collapse. Whether we can disseminate this knowledge to every individual before the tide of Dimensional Collapse and while humanity still retains its sense of urgency and awareness will determine our species’ ability to save itself.
