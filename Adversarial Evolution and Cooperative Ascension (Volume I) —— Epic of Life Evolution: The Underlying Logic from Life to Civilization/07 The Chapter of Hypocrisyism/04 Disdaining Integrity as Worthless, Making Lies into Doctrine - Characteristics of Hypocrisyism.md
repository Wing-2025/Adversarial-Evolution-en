# Discarding Integrity Like a Worn Cloth, Lying as a Religion: Characteristics of Hypocrisyism  
This section primarily references Mr. Wu Xiaobo’s *The Great Fall Series*. From the perspective of business history, we will discuss some typical acts of hypocrisyism. You will find that among them are both conscious and unconscious hypocrites, whose words and deeds are quite thought-provoking.  

It is likely common knowledge that the psychological trap of "a lie repeated a hundred times becomes the truth" is well-known. I have summarized another psychological trap that is equally effective and deserves close attention: When a lie is obviously exaggerated, although you may not believe it 100%, you cannot help but feel a slight tinge of conviction, thinking that even the most exaggerated lie would not be inflated by a hundredfold. However, you might be wrong—the deceiver’s goal has already been achieved. For the lie has been exaggerated by ten thousandfold, and the deceiver never intended for you to believe it entirely.  

### Mu Qizhong: From "Top Mainland Tycoon" to "Top Mainland Swindler"  
Let us recount the "legendary" life of Mu Qizhong, once dubbed the "Top Swindler of Mainland China," through which we can glean some "swindling techniques."  

In 1989, Mu Qizhong learned that the Soviet Union, on the verge of collapse, was preparing to sell a batch of Tu-154 aircraft but had no buyers. With a whimsical idea, he rented a rural house on the outskirts of Beijing and scoured for potential buyers. Having no expertise in aviation, he scrambled about like a headless fly. A month later, he finally learned that Sichuan Airlines, which had just launched operations a year prior, was looking to purchase aircraft.  

Mu Qizhong approached Sichuan Airlines, and after a roundabout process, the airline agreed to purchase four Tu-154 aircraft. He then organized 500 train carriages of canned goods, leather garments, and other commodities in Sichuan to trade with the Soviet side in a barter deal. This trade was declared successful by 1992, with Mu Qizhong claiming he earned 80 million to 100 million yuan. (Later, it was discovered that all figures mentioned by Mu Qizhong were merely for reference.)  

In 1992, Mu Qizhong proposed that Nande Company would exclusively sponsor the "Chinese Economic Forum" with $1.5 million, to be held twice annually on the mainland, inviting Chinese entrepreneurs and economists from around the world. The same year, he announced a collaboration with a private tech entrepreneur to establish a 1,000-acre high-tech development zone in Beijing for high-tech project development and production, with Nande investing 50 million yuan and planning to build a high-protein feed processing plant in every county nationwide.  

In April 1993, Nande and Chongqing University signed a joint education agreement at Chongqing Hotel. Meanwhile, both parties decided to modernize Chongqing hotpot into a fast-food format for global expansion, aiming for 100 billion yuan in sales revenue within five years. Nande also pledged to allocate 1.5 billion yuan from the 100 billion yuan revenue to establish an education fund for Chongqing University. That spring, Mu Qizhong announced a 10 billion yuan investment to exclusively develop Manzhouli and build a "Northern Hong Kong." In November of the same year, Nande signed an agreement with Zhangjiajie City to invest 1 billion yuan in regional development.  

In 1994, Mu Qizhong proposed constructing an 118-story skyscraper, tentatively sited in Beijing or Shanghai, with the square below named "Deng Xiaoping Square," requiring a 10 billion yuan investment (Mu was adept at gauging public sentiment). Later that year, he toured northern Shaanxi with great emotion, declaring plans to invest 5 billion yuan there. In March, Nande announced three major projects: the "Giant Chinese Sculpture," the "World Chinese Businessmen Conference," and "Nande Villas."  

In 1995, Mu Qizhong proposed establishing a "Nande Confucian Business University" with a 500 million yuan investment during a speech.  

In March 1996, Mu Qizhong suggested blasting a 50-kilometer-wide, over 2,000-meter-deep gap in the Himalayas to channel warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean into China’s arid northwest, turning it into a rainy region. He then proposed using directional blasting to build a dam in the Hengduan Mountains, which could divert 201.7 billion cubic meters of water into the Yellow River, requiring a 57 billion yuan investment. In September of the same year, Nande publicly announced its investment in the "International Satellite-8," with a total construction cost of $100 million.  

These astonishing investment projects repeatedly made headlines in domestic media, placing Mu Qizhong under the glaring spotlight and casting Nande Company in a radiant light. He traveled across the country, delivering speeches, conducting inspections, and making promises everywhere, sparking a "Mu Qizhong craze" wherever he went. He was revered as a "master of capital operation" and a "pioneer of Chinese private enterprises."  

In February 1995, *Forbes* magazine listed Mu Qizhong in its 1994 global rich list, ranking him 4th among mainland Chinese billionaires. That same year, a private magazine named *Fortune* crowned him "China’s Top Private Entrepreneur" and "Top Super Wealthy Individual of Mainland China," while Mu himself claimed his assets were "at least 2 billion yuan, possibly 10 billion yuan."  

In January 1996, a 450-page book titled *The Rise of Mainland China’s Richest Man: Mu Qizhong*, written by a Xinhua News Agency reporter, was published by Writers Publishing House, propelling Mu Qizhong to the peak of fame. In the book, he announced Nande’s new goal: to rank among the world’s top 10 enterprises within 5 to 10 years.  

However, throughout his lengthy business career in the 1990s, apart from the "canned goods for aircraft" deal, what profitable business projects did Mu Qizhong actually undertake? This remains a mystery to this day. At the time, Nande Economic Group was still operating out of a basement in Yangfangdian, Beijing. According to its promotional materials: "Its business scope spans over 10 fields, including aviation services, leasing, shipping, financial services, venture capital, trade, industry, real estate, high technology, engineering development, and information consulting. It has over 20 branches, subsidiaries, and 7 major research institutes in China, with trading partners worldwide."  

Mu Qizhong’s "branches," "subsidiaries," and "research institutes" were all empty shells—some units had only one person, and several units shared a single individual. Gu Jian, an advisor to Nande at the time, heard Mu inflate his assets from 300 million yuan to 5 billion yuan within a few dozen days. When Gu asked, "Where is your money? How did you earn it? How much tax have you paid?" Mu replied smugly, "Who would check me? How could they check me!"  

In the first half of 1995, facing a cash crunch, Mu Qizhong decided to obtain letters of credit without importing goods. Nande Group successively defrauded the Hubei Branch of the Bank of China into issuing letters of credit, with a total suspected fraud amount of $75.07 million. On February 5, 1999, Mu Qizhong was approved for arrest by the Wuhan People’s Procuratorate on suspicion of letter of credit fraud. On May 30, 2000, Mu Qizhong was sentenced to life imprisonment for "letter of credit fraud."  

Throughout Mu Qizhong’s business career, "deception" seemed to be his only expertise. Even his self-proclaimed "karate" theory reeked of deception. He once boasted, "Since 1992, I have realized that past economic laws have become laughable in the market economy. The industrial civilization model is outdated in the West and even more inapplicable in China. We need to establish new game rules for a wisdom-based economy. Some say I practice 'karate,' but I believe karate is the high-level application of intangible assets, especially wisdom, which is my centurial contribution to China’s economic circle."  

After his downfall, he stated, "I believe my greatest contribution to our country in this life is 'karate.' I discovered something new—a method for our country and nation to rise again. I have engaged in various businesses, and through experience, I found: farming is inferior to working in industry, working in industry is inferior to commerce, commerce is inferior to borrowing (running a bank), borrowing is inferior to not repaying (listing on the stock market), and not repaying is inferior to non-interference (stable division). All my failures were without exception due to producing a product, while all my successes shared the common feature of never producing a product."  

Even Mr. Wu Ge, the author of *Mu Qizhong: Top Swindler of Mainland China*, who ultimately "pushed Mu Qizhong to his grave," admitted, "When I think of Mu Qizhong, I feel moved, even on the verge of tears. As a person, Mu Qizhong’s life was full of hardships. Some may resent his rogue behavior, but as a human being, he was a 'great man'—talented, yet ultimately destroyed by his own wisdom and courage."  

If Mu Qizhong was not lying, his actions align with the characteristics of an unconscious hypocrite—he deluded himself into believing his deceptions were efforts to revitalize the national economy and benefit the public. Another fact is that his actions generated almost no cooperative dividends—since he engaged in no real industries—and instead, they resulted in losses from grabbing behavior.  

Perhaps we can gain clearer insight into his mindset through his own words. During his final public appearance, he stated, "Now the public calls me a swindler. If we engage with cutting-edge technology, they call it sorcery—something no one can understand. I think of the fates of Copernicus and Bruno, whom everyone deemed heretics to be hanged or burned. Reflecting, I realize the business community lacks culture. Chinese entrepreneurs have fallen one after another, yet perhaps I am the only one whose business lifecycle remains evergreen, forever in the spotlight."  

Like his other impromptu speeches, this one was stirring, but upon careful reflection, it lacks logic. He did not directly address his own issues but instead deflected and shifted blame, invoking Copernicus and Bruno to steer the conversation into another context. It was through this sophisticated art of evasion that he deceived the public—perhaps even himself.  

### From Health Supplements to Wellness: A String of Scams [Optional Reading]  
Coincidentally, the decade-long chaos in the health supplement industry follows the same "karate" logic of capital operation—both aim to deceive others and profit by creating hype through propaganda, fabricating inspiring slogans, and inventing baseless concepts and false achievements.  

#### "The Wind Rises, Dragons Soar"—Shenyang Feilong

The apparent instigator seems to have been Shenyang Feilong Group. Under the leadership of Jiang Wei, Feilong invested the vast majority of its funds into advertising and promotion for health supplements, standing in stark contrast to its minimal investment in product R&D. The company’s advertising expenditures in both 1993 and 1994 exceeded 100 million yuan. When asked about annual R&D investment during its application for listing in Hong Kong, Jiang Wei reluctantly claimed it was 20 million yuan, though the actual amount was likely far lower. This indicates that consumers were primarily paying for the advertising costs of the health supplements they purchased, rather than for improvements in product quality. Such a misplacement of priorities—prioritizing promotion over quality—how could it ever lead to the creation of increasingly superior products? What is even more infuriating, however, are Feilong’s various false claims, exaggerated assertions, and violations of regulations in its advertising. A writer named Xu Xu once penned a summary titled *The Death of Feilong*, which exposed: promoting a health supplement as a cure-all therapeutic drug; marketing a type of wine as a panacea that “treats illness when sick, prevents illness when healthy, and suits all ages and seasons”; and fabricating claims of exporting Yansheng Hubao Liquid to South Korea for 8 billion yuan. Later health supplement brands such as Giant, Sanzhu, and Hongtao K would follow Feilong’s flawed trajectory.  

#### “Let the People Bear Witness: Let 100 Million People Become Wise First!”—Shenzhen Giant  
In 1996, Giant Group launched its health supplement “Jubufei” with the promotional slogan “Let the People Bear Witness.” It too adopted an advertising blitz strategy, which, in Mr. Wu Xiaobo’s words, meant “Giant’s advertisements flooded media outlets across the country.” A promotional article titled *Sharks Do Not Suffer from Cancer*—ostensibly authored by Dr. Yuan Bin of the University of California, Los Angeles, and widely distributed by Giant—was in reality written by a foreign language student with no knowledge of health supplements. Other health supplement copy, including case studies, was largely fabricated by talented students from prestigious universities’ journalism or Chinese departments. Even more shocking, Giant’s head of health supplement R&D was concurrently a manager at an advertising agency. These behind-the-scenes realities stood in stark contrast to Giant’s aggressively promoted slogan “Let the People Bear Witness.” In essence, the substantial sums consumers paid for their health and well-being were mostly funneled into hiring writers to fabricate false advertisements, which were then propagated through media to promote a product of negligible value.  

#### “Strive to Be China’s Top Taxpayer”—Jinan Sanzhu  
Sanzhu Oral Liquid later followed a similar path. At the height of Sanzhu’s success, a book titled *The Chinese Can Speak of Wealth* was published, with its protagonist being the “remarkable figure” Wu Bingxin, who had built Sanzhu’s myth. The book’s cover emblazoned sensational claims: “The Mystery of Wu Bingxin’s 10 Billion Yuan in 3 Years,” “A Business Warfare Tutorial for Chinese Private Enterprises,” and his declarations: “To Become China’s Top Taxpayer in 3 Years” and “To Enter the Global Industry Top 100 in 10 Years.” Yet examining the means by which Sanzhu accumulated wealth reveals: plagiarizing the name and ISSN of *Jiangsu Health News* to publish a “Special Issue on Kaili Oral Liquid” that bore no resemblance to the genuine issues 322 and 323, with 6 million copies distributed. Later, it was discovered that an article titled *Soul Tied to Kailai* in the special issue, which vividly introduced six “overseas-educated doctors” with photos and resumes, was entirely fabricated. All six doctors were impostors; the first-listed “American-educated microecology doctor” Mr. Liu Rongsheng was actually an ordinary employee of Nanjing Kelike Industry & Trade Co., living in Yaohuamen, Nanjing, and his real name was not even “Liu Rongsheng.”  

<p align="center"><img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c1af92b-c131-4084-89b0-a9f27a9fee94" />

After Sanzhu Oral Liquid was developed, Wu Bingxin was proclaimed its inventor and “chief scientist,” yet the process of its development remained an obscure “trade secret.” Its advertised main ingredient, “Bifidobacterium” (the same as in Angli No.1), was claimed to “enter the intestines via oral consumption, reproduce, and thereby regulate the body’s internal environment for health benefits.” However, a 1996 incident further unraveled its mystique. On June 3 of that year, Chen Boshun, a retired boatman from Hanshou County, Changde, Hunan, was persuaded by Sanzhu’s promise of “treating illness when sick, preventing illness when healthy” to purchase 10 bottles of Sanzhu Oral Liquid for 428 yuan. After taking two bottles, his symptoms improved, but they recurred when he stopped. By the third to fourth bottles, he developed widespread redness and itching; after finishing the eighth, his body ulcerated, oozing pus. On June 23, he was hospitalized with a diagnosis of “high-protein allergy caused by Sanzhu.” His condition fluctuated, and he passed away on September 3. His wife and daughter sued Sanzhu. By late 1997, the court sent two unopened bottles of Sanzhu Oral Liquid to the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products for testing. The resulting report (No. SJIS970667) stated: “No viable Bifidobacterium or other live bacteria (the advertised main ingredient) detected; positive guinea pig allergy test; positive mouse safety toxicity test, with pathological changes observed in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and thymus. The tested product is unqualified.” This explosive revelation dealt a fatal blow to Sanzhu, which was already teetering. It is said that upon hearing the news, Wu Bingxin fell seriously ill for 20 days, with doctors issuing a critical condition notice. Even in his illness, he murmured: “I don’t ask for much—just to contribute to the nation. If I’m not allowed to do that, I’ll stop.” (Does this not echo the style of Mou Qizhong?)  

#### The Failure Genes of Chinese Enterprises  
Reflecting on the failure cases of enterprises over the 30 years of reform and opening up, Mr. Wu Xiaobo summarized the “failure genes” of Chinese enterprises: 1. A general lack of moral sense and humanistic concern; 2. A general lack of respect for rules and order; 3. A general lack of systematic professionalism. However, a more objective perspective reveals that false advertising and consumer deception were precisely the short-term “secrets to success” for certain enterprises. The “failures” mentioned above were primarily due to their overly extreme and clumsy hypocritical tactics. More fortunate, more nuanced, higher-order, and better-concealed hypocritical tactics did not “fail.” It is precisely because these “hypocritical” enterprises succeeded that the market competition environment deteriorated, with Bad Money Driving Out Good Money, leading the entire market to become short-term oriented. Truly innovative and great enterprises, in turn, found it harder to succeed.  

### What Constitutes Ability? What Is Involution? [Optional Reading]  
There was once a college entrance exam essay prompt. A young man, journeying through life, arrived at a ferry crossing with seven backpacks: “Health,” “Beauty,” “Integrity,” “Aptitude,” “Scholarship,” “Wealth,” and “Honor.” The ferry set off smoothly, but after some time, winds and waves arose, rocking the boat perilously. The ferryman said: “The boat is overloaded; you must discard one backpack to survive.” Reluctant to part with any, the young man hesitated. The ferryman added: “To gain, you must lose.” After a moment of reflection, the young man cast “Integrity” into the water.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a49864-54a9-400d-b495-3bf3588529ab" />  
</p>  

While public opinion advises against emulating this young man—and students’ essays certainly dare not endorse his choice—in reality, if two young men were compared—one discarding Integrity, the other discarding another “ability”—the former would likely outcompete the latter. Though we can find examples of integrity yielding benefits and being celebrated (e.g., Dutch merchants trading honestly with enemy nations during war, or the “Anti-Deception Plaque” of the “Red-Top Merchant” Hu Xueyan), I can state with confidence that throughout human history, when unethical behavior goes unpunished and uncondemned, individuals with integrity are statistically less competitive than those without. Specific examples need not be repeated here; the previous section already detailed numerous Grabbingist behaviors involving dishonesty, which indeed brought substantial benefits to the perpetrators, enabling them to triumph in individual competition.  

#### Cooperative Capability: First Incompetence, Then Super-ability  
As discussed in the previous chapter, civilization is not only defined by what we *can* do but, more crucially, by what we *instinctively cannot* do. This “incompetence” can be termed “cooperative capability.” “Integrity” is precisely such a cooperative capability—nearly all virtues fall into this category: Conscience, Compassion, Sense of Justice, Self-reflection, Loyalty, and Love (in subsequent discussions, any of these terms can replace “Integrity” without altering the logic). Some may question: If anyone can “choose” to be honest (conscientious, empathetic, just, loyal), how can this be considered a “capability”? While anyone can adopt a facade of integrity in trivial matters, not everyone possesses the responsibility and resistance to temptation required to *uphold* integrity (conscience, empathy, justice, loyalty). The instinctive resistance to unethical behavior serves as a measure of one’s integrity capability (and similarly for other cooperative capabilities).

Some individuals can maintain integrity in ordinary circumstances, yet when their personal interests are threatened, they may readily abandon integrity (alongside conscience, empathy, justice, and loyalty). Such individuals possess low "integrity capability" (and similarly low capabilities in conscience, empathy, justice, and loyalty). Those with strong integrity capabilities (and strong capabilities in the aforesaid virtues) will instinctively adhere to these virtues even when they suffer material losses, endure destitution, face ridicule, or are led astray by fallacious doctrines. Even if they eventually act against these virtues, they will still be tormented by intense self - reproach. I refer to such capabilities—those that facilitate group cooperation and thereby generate significant Cooperative Dividends—as "Cooperative Capabilities." In contrast, "health," "agility," and "scholarship" are categorized as "Individual Capabilities."  

Cooperative Capabilities, in most cases, undermine Individual Capabilities and individual fitness, making them difficult to evolve under narrow - sense natural selection. Instead, they are the combined product of Virtue Selection, Sexual Selection, and Group Selection. Precisely because these "cooperation - sustaining capabilities" are hard to acquire through conventional evolutionary pathways, they are all the more precious. As the saying goes, "Such treasures are meant only for the heavens"—once lost, they are extremely difficult to regain. These capabilities demand the collective care of the entire human society.  

#### Involution Stemming from Excessive Individual Competition  

There are numerous Cooperative Capabilities akin to integrity, including the sense of justice, sense of responsibility, empathic capability, and willingness to help, as previously discussed. In societies marked by extreme individual competition, where everyone pursues the maximization of their own short - term interests, these Cooperative Capabilities are nearly impossible to sustain. For if one refuses to help others while enjoying their assistance, they will inevitably expropriate greater benefits than those who consistently help. Over time, those who are willing to help will be eliminated by the indifferent. When Cooperative Capabilities are completely exhausted, involution becomes an inevitable outcome.  

This is not to downplay the importance of Individual Capabilities; rather, people have sacrificed too much in terms of Cooperative Capabilities to gain very limited improvements in Individual Capabilities. Such improvements are a case of prioritizing trivial matters over essentials, reversing the proper order. Relatively speaking, "Cooperative Capabilities" are rarer, more difficult to form and sustain, and harder to discern than "Individual Capabilities."  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45380085-e587-4784-87dc-a9535e53f829" /></p>  

If we continue to blindly revere success - oriented doctrines and the distorted evolutionary narrative of "the victor is the judge," the noble sentiments and virtues cultivated by humanity through long - standing Virtue - Upholding and Evil - Rejectionism and group competition—such as love, compassion, pity, and responsibility, as well as sincerity, gratitude, tolerance, integrity, benevolence, and courage—will be continuously eroded and depleted in the crucible of intense individual competition. This is because individuals with these virtues often possess weaker individual competitiveness and are more prone to elimination in extreme individual competition.  

The one - sided emphasis on Individual Capabilities at the expense of Cooperative Capabilities may lie at the root of issues within examination - oriented education and testing systems. Even the most equitable Individual Capability assessment mechanisms are prone to trends of involution, short - sightedness, and even Grabbingism. Only by clarifying the fundamental causes of these issues can people hope to avoid such tragedies.
