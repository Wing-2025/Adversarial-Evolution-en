# Unwritten Rules—The Game Rules of Hypocrisyists  
In his book *Hidden Rules*, Mr. Wu Si recounts the unwritten norms that lie beneath formal regulations and official decrees, effectively governing the operations of officialdom—terms he refers to as "unwritten rules." Since then, people have customarily used "unwritten rules" to describe those invisible, uncodified, conventionally accepted, widely prevalent, and practically effective rules that people "must follow." Of course, unwritten rules may have their reasonable aspects, potentially serving as a supplementary and compromising mechanism outside of explicit rules (laws) but within the bounds of human sentiment. However, more often, the "unwritten rules" we observe are employed by hypocrisyists to weave hidden game rules that facilitate their grabbing behaviors. The fundamental purpose of these latent rules is to mask their true intentions, thereby evading the "judgment" of the "Virtue Selection" mechanism enforced by virtue-upholding and evil-rejecting individuals.

Mr. Gao Yang’s depiction of bribery tactics in *Hu Xueyan* vividly reflects the characteristics of unwritten rules. During the Qing Dynasty, when officials traveled to Beijing to offer bribes, they first followed the unwritten rule of consulting calligraphy, painting, and antiques shops in Liulichang. After stating the amount of silver taels they intended to give to a high-ranking official, the shop owner would expertly advise them to present a painting by a specific artist. Upon receiving the silver, the shop owner would then visit the official’s residence, purchase the same artist’s painting from the official’s collection, and hand it over to the bribing party. The bribing official could then visit the recipient with this elegant, untainted gift free of mercenary odor, returning the painting "intact"—thus completing the bribery in a refined manner. All steps here were lawful, with the ambiguity of painting prices ensuring the security of the bribe. Even more astutely, if any party in this chain were to report the act, others would be difficult to hold legally accountable. For example, if the bribing official exposed the recipient, neither legal nor moral penalties would befall the bribing party, as the recipient could feign ignorance. All they had done was sell and receive a painting. These sophisticated "unwritten rules," though mostly uncodified, have surprisingly persisted to this day.

The *Chronicle of Jinghu* (autobiographical年谱) by Duan Guangqing, an official of the late Qing Dynasty, records the experiences of Ningbo fishermen and merchants purchasing maritime security. At the time, Ningbo was plagued by pirates, severely disrupting the businesses of fishermen and merchants. This was fundamentally a dereliction of duty by the Qing Dynasty naval forces, who received salaries and rations but failed to act. The Qing government monopolized public service operations, leaving no room for competition (any challenge was deemed rebellion). Left with no choice, merchants and fishermen pooled their funds to incentivize the naval forces to patrol and maintain order. Their inaction was thus a means of "secondary charging": if an impulsive individual stepped forward to advocate for free protection, they would cut off the financial benefits of other hypocrites and destroy their livelihoods.  

Let us further examine how the unwritten rule of "ghost soldiers" (fictitious troops drawing salaries) weakened China’s combat effectiveness. How much did China spend during the First Opium War? According to research by Mao Haijian, an expert on the Opium War, based on primary sources, China ultimately expended 30 million silver taels. How much did the British spend? From *British Parliamentary Documents*, Mao Haijian found a detailed account of British war expenditures submitted in response to House of Commons inquiries. Converted to silver taels, this amounted to 12.63 million—only 40% of China’s expenditure. The war was fought on China’s home turf, with Britain traveling thousands of miles; China had the advantages of timing and geography. Why, then, did China’s military expenditure reach twice that of Britain’s? Multiple factors contributed, but the primary cause was that a significant portion of China’s military funds were embezzled and lost. How did this embezzlement occur? The methods were simple and crude: officers on the Zhejiang front fabricated a "Southern Braves" force of 9,000 men, defrauding the state of 100,000 silver taels in military funds; Zheng Dingchen, son of General Zheng Guohong, falsified a naval force of 20,000, siphoning off 300,000 to 400,000 silver taels in military salaries. Such incidents were rampant during the Opium War, documented in abundant records—one-third of military expenditures were directly embezzled.

Hypocrisyists, like parasites, erode the efficiently cooperative whole. Their latent grabbing behaviors generate massive grabbing deficits yet remain highly covert, evading the sanctions of Virtue Selection. In such a state, a nation or ethnicity may appear externally unproblematic, but internally, it harbors extremely fatal pathologies. These pathologies accumulate amid feasts and celebrations, periods of apparent prosperity. When they finally manifest, the decline is abrupt; by the time people awaken, it is already beyond remedy. This pattern holds true throughout history, across all civilizations.
