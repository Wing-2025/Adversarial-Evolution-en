# Hypocrisyism - The Cancer Cells of the Human Community of Life【★★】  
Regarding the pernicious effects of the spread of Hypocrisyism, we can draw an analogy with cancer cells—hypocrisyists can be seen as veritable "cancer cells" within human society. What makes cancer cells terrifying? In fact, cancer cells themselves are not inherently terrifying. Most of the time, they do not release toxins, do not actively destroy normal cells, and they do not even commit overtly malicious acts. The only thing they are inclined to do is continuous division. The true terror of cancer cells lies in their exceptional "camouflage" ability—a signature trait. Normally, our bodies possess a robust immune system that eliminates all abnormal cells. Why, then, does the immune system spare cancer cells? For a long time, it was believed that cancer cells weaken the body's immune function. However, this is not the case. Cancer cells exploit the protein "PD-1" in our bodies to deceive the immune system. This protein "PD-1" is extremely susceptible to being "co-opted" by cancer cells. Once co-opted, PD-1 enables cancer cells to send a signal to the immune system: "Hi, don’t kill me—we’re on the same side!" Thus, even with its discerning capacity, the immune system fails to detect the cancer cells disguised in a "sheep’s skin," missing the opportunity to eliminate them.

In reality, cancer cells can be viewed as a result of Adversarial Evolution, where they are selected by immune cells amid random mutations during cell division. Abnormal cells that emerge from mutations but lack the ability to deceive T cells are quickly eliminated. Only those cancer cells with exceptional deceptive capabilities survive and are "selected." [Thus, the origin of cancer cells is identical to that of Hypocrisyism. They are the same type of "ailment" across different dimensional life forms.]()

### The Cancerization Formula  
Someone once formulated a summary of the probability of cancer occurrence: [Probability of Cancer Occurrence = Number of Cell Divisions × Number of Mutations per Division × Probability that Mutated Genes Are Oncogenes]()  
This formula is highly incisive. Through it, we can deduce:  
- 1. The older the age, the more times cells need to divide, so the elderly are more prone to cancer than the young.  
- 2. The more damage an organ sustains, the more repairs it requires; thus, long-term organ damage and repeated tissue repair tend to induce cancer.  

Similarly, we can formulate a summary for the "cancer" of four-dimensional life forms—Hypocrisyism:  
Probability of Hypocrisyism Occurrence = Number of Generational Replacements × Average Number of Reproductive Mutations per Generation × Probability that Mutated Genes Are Hypocrisy Genes  

From this, we can also derive preliminary conclusions (further discussions will be presented in the second volume of this book):  
- 1. The older a dynasty, the more generational replacements occur; thus, older dynasties are more prone to "cancer."  
- 2. Aristocratic families and royal lineages, which produce more offspring, are more likely to spawn "cancer cells."  
- 3. Amid continuous warfare and rapid population replenishment, "cancer cells" are prone to emerge.  

As cancer cells proliferate, they encroach on the living space of normal cells. Before metastatic spread, life can still be salvaged through drastic measures (e.g., amputation) or indiscriminate radiotherapy/chemotherapy; once metastasis occurs, recovery becomes impossible. Correspondingly, if hypocrisy genes spread to all corners of a nation, that nation will likely decline (and be "replaced" by other ethnic groups); if hypocrisy genes pervade all ethnic groups, human civilization will likely near its end. Our simulation programs yield the same conclusion: when hypocrisyists emerge within a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist group, the group begins to decline (the red curve represents the number of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals, and the cyan curve represents the number of hypocrisyists).

After several generations, the group will be dominated by hypocrisyists and grabbingists (as shown below).

It is worth noting that [cancer cells themselves are "short-sighted" creatures of Adversarial Evolution. Once their host dies, cancer cells soon perish due to loss of sustenance—a fate strikingly similar to that of hypocrisyists. Yet the laws of Adversarial Evolution are unrelenting—even with the "knowledge" of a mutually destructive outcome, evolution proceeds inevitably]()—because Murphy’s Law remains in effect. I wonder: if "cancer cells" and "hypocrisyists" deeply understood this book, might they harbor a thought: "To ensure my genes survive longer, please find and stop me!"  

### The Undercurrent of Grabbing  
Compared to overtly recognizable grabbing behaviors—such as bacterial/viral infections or robbery—we may refer to trends like the cancerization of multicellular organisms and the hypocrisyization of human society as the ["Undercurrent of Grabbing"](). On the surface, this process appears calm, but beneath it lies a turbulent tide. Superficially peaceful, it erodes over time: virtuous individuals are eliminated, and hypocrisyists rise to power. Hypocrisyists may also possess exceptional capabilities, resilience, patience, and acumen for seizing opportunities. They consciously or unconsciously rationalize their actions; simultaneously, they consciously or unconsciously fabricate charges to attack others, with "moral coercion" being their most common tactic, and "blaming others without self-reflection" their most typical psychological defense mechanism. This trend is often insidious, as "concealment" and "deception" are key to the success of Hypocrisyism. [Thus, it is unsurprising that many will intentionally or unintentionally oppose this law and the phenomena revealed in this book, and their opposition will not be direct—instead, they will employ their most adept method of "nitpicking," which is entirely normal.]() Just as corrupt officials do not wish for the public to see *In the Name of the People* and seek to ban it, hypocrisyists fear most the exposure of their disguises.  

Within three-dimensional life forms, this insidious upsurge manifests as malignant tumors; once metastatic, recovery is impossible. Within four-dimensional life forms—human society—this insidious upsurge manifests as the undercurrent of Hypocrisyism; once it erupts, the trajectory of prosperity and decline reverses, leading to internal depletion and collapse.
