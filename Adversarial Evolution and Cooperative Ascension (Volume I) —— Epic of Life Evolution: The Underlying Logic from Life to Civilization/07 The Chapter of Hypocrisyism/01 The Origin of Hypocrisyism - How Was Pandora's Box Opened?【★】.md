When humanity chose to challenge the fundamental cosmic law—the Grabbing Tendency—its fate was already destined to be both resplendent and arduous. Grabbing symbolizes chaos and entropy increase; Mutualistic Cooperation symbolizes order and entropy decrease. Though the strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism is exquisitely refined, the Grabbing Tendency, akin to water flowing downhill, or the law of increasing entropy where chaos inevitably arises within order, seizes every opportunity and infiltrates every crevice. To frame this in a more colloquial yet vivid manner, the Grabbing Trend conforms to Murphy’s Law—if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. [Hypocrisyism is essentially Grabbingism disguised in a moral cloak, a deceptive means of practicing grabbing within Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist groups.]() It will become the first truly insurmountable challenge humanity faces after achieving great successes through the Virtue Selection Mechanism. Over a prolonged historical period, it will linger as the most insidious, fatal, and easily underestimated adversary lurking behind humanity’s brilliant civilization. If cancer is the ultimate disease of three-dimensional life forms, then Hypocrisyism is unarguably the ultimate disease of four-dimensional life forms—human civilization.  

# The Origin of Hypocrisyism – How the Pandora’s Box Was Opened? 【★】  
The Virtue Selection Mechanism brought humanity into the "Edenic Period," during which the number of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals grew rapidly, and humanity’s group competitiveness surged. After the "Great Leap Period," humanity swiftly ascended to dominance over Earth. However, under the laws of Adversarial Evolution, another genetic type—Hypocrisyism—also gained unprecedented room for development in this process.  

### Escaping the Judgment of Virtue Selection – The Evolutionary Driving Force of Hypocrisyism  
What, then, is Hypocrisyism? As discussed earlier, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism supports and fosters other individuals of the same genotype through "Virtue Selection" while suppressing and eliminating Grabbingist individuals via joint defense, punishment, and weakening. Meanwhile, Grabbing genes, under selective pressure, continuously evolve. [One particularly effective adaptation is learning to feign Virtue,]() enabling them to be perceived as fellow Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals by others, thereby gaining assistance and avoiding punishment.

Nonetheless, these Hypocrisyist individuals continue to engage in grabbing behaviors in substance. Thus, they evade the punitive effects of "Virtue Selection" while securing more survival resources through grabbing than genuine Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals, thereby attaining higher fitness and greater genetic advantages. This advantage drives the rapid proliferation of their genes. Even Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals, under the selective pressure of "natural selection," may evolve in this direction—they already know how to perform virtuous acts; they need only learn to secretly grab while concealing their actions, or to feign virtue in minor matters while surreptitiously seizing major benefits. Hence, Hypocrisyism is an evolutionary tendency within Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist groups.  

### No Trust, No Hypocrisyism  
Intriguingly, hypocritical behaviors are nearly absent among non-human species in nature. The biological world abounds with various forms of deception and camouflage, such as brood parasitism by cuckoos or the mimicry of *Atemeles pubicollis*, but these do not involve feigning virtue—they are "honest villains." Why does Hypocrisyism emerge exclusively in humans? On one hand, hypocrites must adopt covert grabbing methods, which are inherently more complex than overt grabbing. On the other hand, feigning virtue requires deceiving Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals’ moral judgments, necessitating sophisticated decision-making mechanisms and occasional altruistic acts to maintain a virtuous facade—all of which demand significant biological resources. The most critical reason, however, is that "trust"—a "cooperative capability"—is nearly exclusive to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist species.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae997f8a-9b6d-4012-afda-69ff14c173a4" />

"Trust" is a double-edged sword. If a group consists entirely of naturally "trustworthy" individuals, where everyone freely entrusts their safety to others, "trust" will generate enormous cooperative dividends for the group. Hypocrites exploit this "trust" to grab benefits—betraying trust, reneging on commitments, and abandoning obligations—thereby reaping immense gains. [In a group devoid of "trust," where everyone is perpetually on guard, hypocrites have no chance to survive.]() Imagine placing a hypocrite in a purely Grabbingist group: its grabbing is less ruthless than pure Grabbingists, and its physical fitness is inferior to those evolved solely for grabbing. Such a hypocrite would be swiftly eliminated. Placing a hypocrite in a purely Tit-for-Tat group also spells doom: Tit-for-Tat mechanists focus only on how others treat them, are highly calculating, and exact retribution for slights. Hypocrites have little room to feign virtue before Tit-for-Tat mechanists—[judging Virtue and Evil is difficult, but judging whether someone is good to oneself only requires a good memory and sufficient shrewdness](). Thus, Hypocrisyism gains no advantage against pure Grabbingists or Tit-for-Tat mechanists, and its genes are eliminated due to ineffectiveness. Hypocrisyist strategies can only parasitize groups dominated by Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—groups naturally trusting of companions and inclined to reward virtue. This is the origin of Hypocrisyism. Hypocrites are parasites on virtuous groups; without virtue, there is no hypocrisy. Hence, hypocritical behaviors are rare in the animal kingdom, akin to a major "bug" in life’s evolution—a primary challenge faced by life at every dimensional ascension. Simulation programs corroborate this: Hypocrisyism emerges only when Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism initially consolidates, and diminishes as its scale declines.

### Conscious Hypocrisyism and Unconscious Hypocrisyism  
Hypocrisyism generally divides into two types: Conscious Hypocrisyism and Unconscious Hypocrisyism, each with its own perils. Conscious hypocrites employ human intellect, logic, eloquence, and all other means to feign virtue, executing premeditated, purposeful "virtue-masking deception" that is nearly undetectable. Unconscious hypocrites, guided by the principle of "deceiving others by first deceiving oneself," rarely reflect on their actions. Their subconscious selectively ignores their own malicious behaviors and consequences or rationalizes their grabbing with excuses. "Double standards" are their instinct; moral coercion is their "weapon." They spout benevolence and morality but act like petty thieves. These "self-deceiving" hypocrites often commit misdeeds with apparent sincerity, blending malice with kindness and virtue with ill intent—making them even harder to identify. Conscious hypocrisy wields intellect and logic; unconscious hypocrisy wields sincerity. Both exploit uniquely human virtues—compassion, pity, trust, and guilt—to grab benefits.  

### Hatred Without Apparent Cause, Deep as Bone Marrow  
One might question the plausibility of "self-deception," but it is far from uncommon. Many experience moments where "emotion overrides logic," and "making excuses" occurs unconsciously—a phenomenon consistent with evolutionary psychology. In the split-brain experiment, when a subject’s left and right brains were disconnected, the experimenter showed a chicken claw to the right eye (connected to the left brain) and a snow scene to the left eye (connected to the right brain). The subject’s left hand pointed to a shovel (due to the right brain’s snow scene), while the right hand pointed to a chicken. When asked why the left hand pointed to a shovel, the subject unhesitatingly replied, "To clean the chicken coop." Since the language center resides in the left brain, which was unaware of the snow scene, it quickly fabricated a self-deceiving narrative: "To clean the chicken coop." (This case is adapted from *Insight*.)  

Ordinary self-deception is harmless, but the cognitive biases toward self and others caused by Hypocrisyism are far more dangerous. In particular, the "evil-rejecting" psychology of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism can easily devolve into jealousy, as the evolutionary path from rejecting evil to jealousy is exceedingly short. How extreme can this psychological distortion become? Keigo Higashino, in *Malice*, offers a poignant summary: "Hatred without apparent cause, deep as bone marrow, is the coldest aspect of human nature." Higashino further describes this warped psyche: "I hate you. You are my closest friend, you are kind, you kept my sordid past secret, and you’ve always helped me pursue my dreams. Yet I hate you. I hate that you achieved my dreams first, I hate your superior life, I hate that the person I once scorned now has a bright future, I hate my own weakness, my bad luck, my lack of talent, and that I got cancer before succeeding. I channel all my self-hatred into hating you."

In the book, Nakahara and Nonoguchi were childhood companions who attended primary and junior high school together, sharing a mutual passion for writing. However, Nakahara possessed greater literary talent and persisted in his craft. Years later, when they reunited, Nakahara had become a best-selling Japanese author with a well-established reputation, while Nonoguchi remained unaccomplished. Despite their divergent paths, the kind-hearted Nakahara still regarded Nonoguchi as a friend and introduced him to editors of children’s literature. Yet, it was this very benefactor figure to Nonoguchi who was strangled with a telephone cord by Nonoguchi, whose motive for murder was simply “I just resented him.”  

In *Malice*, Detective Kaga remarks to Nonoguchi: “Within your heart lies malice toward him—a hatred so profound that even you cannot explain its depth. It is this malice that led to this crime. From where does this malice arise? I have investigated meticulously, yet I cannot find any logical justification. What a mindset! Unafraid of arrest, willing to stake your entire life to achieve your goal—this is truly astonishing, unprecedented.” Though this is a fictional story, and an extreme one at that, it is not far removed from reality. I believe many have deeply felt this bone-chilling resentment.  

What is particularly intriguing here is that the resentful individual is willing to sacrifice their own life to destroy another kind-hearted person—a behavior that, in fact, contradicts the fundamental principles of Grabbingism’s self-serving genetic logic, for such an act yields no direct benefit to the hypocrite. The price he pays for his “resentment” seems excessively high. Perhaps we have underestimated the power of Adversarial Evolution, where Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism has achieved remarkable success through its strategy of excluding others by uniting with genetically similar individuals. Is it impossible for Hypocrisyism to form alliances?  

The grabbing nature of hypocrites, however, makes it difficult for them to cooperate on equal terms. Their potential alliances are more likely to be submissive forms of cooperation based on the principles of “bullying the virtuous and fearing the vicious” and “rule by brute force.” It is not entirely irrational for these hypocritical individuals to take certain risks to eliminate their potential “rivals”—the virtuous—to enhance the evolutionary advantage of hypocritical genes. For individuals with strong moral rectitude, once they uncover the true nature of hypocrites, they become significant threats to the hypocrites.  

The grabbing behavior of Hypocrisyism and parasitic grabbing (one may recall the phenomenon of Parasitoidism) share striking similarities. Their cunning and subtlety often leave the targets of their grabbing unaware. They do not engage in direct competition but instead seek out vulnerabilities, striking unexpectedly and taking advantage of unpreparedness—even a thousand-mile dike may collapse due to a tiny ant hole. Parasitoidism, after all, is a form of interspecific grabbing, whereas Hypocrisyism is an intraspecific “parasitoid” phenomenon. This presents an unprecedented and significant challenge to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism.
