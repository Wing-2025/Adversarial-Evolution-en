# Adversarial Evolution – "The Moon Adorns Your Window, and You Adorn Others' Dreams"【★★★】  
While self-cultivationism is the most easily comprehensible evolutionary principle and aligns with classical Darwinian thought, its influence on biological evolutionary trends is actually limited. Especially following the great flourishing of life on Earth, biological evolutionary trends have been more frequently shaped by the "environment" composed of living organisms themselves. Crucially, this environment is constantly changing – as the saying goes, the only constant is change. Moreover, the evolutionary trajectory of this "environment" and that of the species themselves exhibit reciprocal causation and mutual shaping. This dynamic gives rise to a phenomenon I term *Adversarial Evolution* (relative evolution).

To facilitate rapid comprehension, let me provide a simple example. Observations of male side-blotched lizards (*Uta stansburiana*) reveal three types: orange-throated, blue-throated, and yellow-striped. Orange-throated males are highly aggressive, possess large territories, and mate with numerous females (up to seven). Blue-throated males are less aggressive, defend smaller territories, and mate with fewer females (typically three). Yellow-striped males are docile and resemble females, allowing them to sneak into other males' territories and mate surreptitiously. Field researchers have noted a cyclical pattern across generations: orange-throated males dominate initially, followed by yellow-striped males, then blue-throated males, and finally a resurgence of orange-throated males, repeating indefinitely.  

This cycle arises because orange-throated males, with their vast territories and many mates, struggle to detect yellow-striped males disguised as females. However, they easily spot the conspicuous blue-throated males. Consequently, yellow-striped males mate prolifically, producing more yellow-striped offspring who dominate the next generation. When yellow-striped males are numerous, blue-throated males benefit, as their smaller territories and fewer mates enable them to detect and expel yellow-striped intruders, leading blue-throated males to dominate the subsequent generation. When blue-throated males are dominant, robust orange-throated males displace them, seizing their territories and mates, thus reclaiming dominance in the following generation. Hence, these three lizard types cyclically dominate the population.

For readers perplexed by this description, a simple analogy clarifies the dynamics: the rock-paper-scissors game. [The three lizard types exhibit mutually restrictive relationships akin to rock, paper, and scissors.]() The evolutionary process of male side-blotched lizards is cyclical rather than progressing toward greater complexity or "superiority" – a phenomenon I term *Adversarial Evolution*.  

While classical evolutionary theory includes the concept of *coevolution* (generally referring to reciprocal adaptation between two species), this definition is overly narrow, and "coevolution" somewhat misrepresents the dynamics. Thus, this text introduces the more general concept of *Adversarial Evolution* – a deep evolutionary logic manifest across species, within species (among individuals and groups), and at various biological scales (the focus of subsequent chapters will be on intra-species Adversarial Evolution). The direction of species evolution is determined by the combined force of these adversarial factors, which is not static and may even reverse entirely. (Note: Evolutionary game theory is closely related to Adversarial Evolution theory.)

From an algorithmic perspective, traditional Darwinian evolution resembles a genetic algorithm, optimizing a function based on a fixed loss function (evaluation function). Thus, some view "evolution" as "optimization" – the search for a global optimum within a fixed high-dimensional function landscape, emphasizing gradual attainability.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddeb3033-964a-4b05-9ae9-45750a5863d1" /></p>  

In contrast, Adversarial Evolution theory emphasizes a process of adversarial training, mutual selection, and adaptation between organisms (the Generator) and their dynamic biological environment (the Discriminator). [In this context, the "environmental function" itself is not static; the high-dimensional function landscape (manifold) evolves continuously. Consequently, the location of the function's optimal value – the optimization target – also shifts.]()

Such changes may occur slowly (e.g., the emergence of new species) or rapidly (e.g., shifts in genotype frequencies). Understanding Adversarial Evolution through an algorithmic framework renders its mathematical model more rigorous and clear.  

## Examples of Adversarial Evolution  
Adversarial Evolution manifests in numerous contexts. Below are several salient examples:  

### Viral Interactions  
When multiple viruses infect the same host cell, they may share proteins required for genome replication. Defective interfering viruses (DIVs) gain an evolutionary advantage here, as they lack genes essential for viral packaging or specialized polymerases. With shorter genomes, they replicate faster and may be more easily packaged than intact viruses. However, if all viruses are defective, no virus produces the "genome-replicating proteins," halting viral amplification entirely. This exemplifies the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons.  

### Barnyard Grass and Vavilovian Mimicry  
A phenomenon called *Vavilovian mimicry* (named after Soviet botanist Nikolai Vavilov) involves weeds evolving to resemble crops. Weeds in farmlands adapt to human weeding practices: humans remove plants that do not resemble crops, exerting selective pressure favoring weeds that mimic crops. Over millennia, these weeds have evolved into "masters of deception." A prime example is barnyard grass (*Echinochloa crus-galli*), the primary weed in rice paddies, which has evolved to resemble rice so closely – even growing upright without tillering at the seedling stage – that humans struggle to distinguish it, allowing it to survive and thrive.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d236abf-69d2-418c-9a74-dc2253073620" /></p>

As humans use pesticides to control barnyard grass, the weed evolves pesticide resistance. This back-and-forth drastically alters the evolutionary trajectory of barnyard grass. Notably, the traits enabling mimicry and resistance reduce its "fitness" in the narrow Darwinian sense. Concurrently, human evolution is also influenced by barnyard grass: populations that develop superior weed-identification skills or pesticide technologies increase agricultural yields and survival rates. Thus, humans and barnyard grass exhibit Adversarial Evolution.  

### Alseuosmia pusilla and Ant Spiders  
Batesian mimicry – where non-venomous organisms mimic venomous ones – is another Adversarial Evolution phenomenon, common in animals. It also occurs in plants; for example, *Alseuosmia pusilla* (a member of the Alseuosmiaceae family) mimics *Pseudowintera colorata* (a member of the Winteraceae family).

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/969e218a-1883-40f3-8d3e-2c629acfbb22" /></p>  
Considered in isolation, these mimicry phenomena serve no practical purpose; their significance emerges only when contextualized within the broader biotic environment. This evolutionary strategy essentially operates on the principle of "borrowing the tiger’s might"—exploiting predators’ innate awe or fear of other species to scare off potential threats. However, such "adaptation" is highly limited and cannot be generalized to meet the demands of universal natural selection. The consumption of survival resources in this manner, which yields no tangible benefit, actually reduces fitness under "narrow-sense natural selection." Similar mimicry is observed in animals, such as ant-mimicking spiders. As ants are highly successful social animals, their foraging soldier ants have evolved robust defensive capabilities and a collective habit of repelling external threats. Consequently, many birds and predatory insects avoid preying on ants, opting instead to steer clear of them. In response, a large group of spiders (over 200 known species) has evolved to mimic the appearance—and even behavior—of ants. Though this mimicry confers no advantage under narrow-sense natural selection, it significantly enhances survival probabilities when confronted with animals "fearful" of ants. These organisms have mastered the art of leveraging others’ reputations to their own benefit.

### The Short-Faced Bear  
Let us consider less obvious examples, such as large animals characterized by immense size, extraordinary strength, and formidable bite force. Take the short-faced bear, the largest bear species ever discovered by paleontologists. The prehistoric South American giant short-faced bear (*Arctotherium*) averaged 1,600–1,700 kilograms in weight and stood up to 4.9 meters tall when upright.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41dd1946-27b9-4a6d-b150-bd82e2b7e95f" /></p>  

Though these apex predators appeared invincible, scientific research reveals a critical vulnerability: their massive size and weight severely impaired their running ability, making it difficult to chase down prey. Why, then, did they evolve such unwieldy proportions? In reality, they primarily functioned as scavengers—feeding on carrion—relying on their bulk and strength to intimidate primary predators like saber-toothed tigers and dire wolves. Their teeth, capable of crushing bones to access marrow, allowed them to consume parts of carcasses inaccessible to other carnivores. Had their ecosystem lacked primary predators, or if such predators had evolved the ability to digest food rapidly, the short-faced bear would have faced dire survival challenges. Conversely, if other species in the ecosystem were slower-moving, the short-faced bear could have thrived by hunting directly rather than scavenging. Yet this very prosperity would have exerted evolutionary pressure on other species, driving the evolution of faster running abilities. Thus, the physiological trajectory of the short-faced bear was determined by the capabilities of other organisms in its biotic environment—a dynamic environment itself, composed of individuals expressing continuously mutating genes.  

The examples above primarily illustrate interspecific Adversarial Evolution, with mimicry representing a unidirectional form of this process. In truth, Adversarial Evolution is a pervasive phenomenon, manifesting between species, among individuals of the same species, and across all biological scales—from plants and animals to parasites and microorganisms. Among these, the Adversarial Evolution occurring *within* species (among individuals with closely related genes) is particularly fascinating and governed by discernible patterns—a focus of subsequent chapters. Understanding these dynamics will shed light on many previously unexplained phenomena.  

## The Red Queen Hypothesis—"You Have to Run as Fast as You Can Just to Stay in the Same Place"  
The Red Queen Hypothesis, proposed by evolutionary biologist L. van Valen of the University of Chicago in 1973, draws inspiration from Lewis Carroll’s *Through the Looking-Glass*. In the story, the Red Queen tells Alice: "In this country, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place." Van Valen adapted this metaphor to describe the relentless competitive pressures of natural selection: standing still is equivalent to moving backward; stagnation equals extinction.  

The Red Queen Hypothesis aligns with one dimension of the Adversarial Evolution theory presented in this book. However, Adversarial Evolution emphasizes not only the selective pressures imposed by a changing biotic environment on organisms but also the *reverse* selective pressures organisms exert on their biotic environment. The biotic environment and organisms are "environments for each other." Even within a single species, individuals with individuals, individuals with groups, and groups with groups all serve as environments, reciprocally generating selective pressures. As we will explore, Adversarial Evolution exerts profound and complex influences on the trajectory of biological evolution, particularly intertwining with the origin and development of the human species. It indirectly shapes human nature and civilization while posing the greatest challenges for humanity’s future.  

## Key Terms in Adversarial Evolution (Optional Reading)  
To facilitate subsequent discussions, we first define several fundamental terms in Adversarial Evolution.  

### Evolutionary Path  
I use "evolutionary path" to measure the difficulty or probability of transitioning from trait A to trait B. For example, traits that can be achieved through mutations at one or two genetic loci have shorter evolutionary paths. Traits like length, shortness, and size generally fall into this category. Evolutionary paths typically follow the symmetry principle: if the path from A to B is short, the path from B to A is also short. Concepts such as "genetic distance" and "evolutionary distance" in genetics and genomics can be seen as microscopic measurements of evolutionary paths. Notably, evolutionary paths also account for the probability of acquiring new traits through recombination of existing gene segments in the gene pool.  

### Evolutionary Potential  
"Evolutionary potential" refers to the intensity of evolutionary tendency or selective pressure driving the transition from trait A to trait B. Essentially, it reflects a disparity in the probability of A and B being selected under broad-sense selection (or a difference in their broad-sense fitness). The following principle applies: the shorter the evolutionary path between A and B, and the greater the difference in their evolutionary potential, the higher the likelihood of evolving from A to B.  

### Propensity for Facile Evolution  
"Propensity for facile evolution" describes evolutionary tendencies characterized by short paths and strong potential. Evolution from absence to presence generally does not fall under this category, whereas evolution from presence to absence typically does. For instance, as we will discuss later, there exists a propensity for facile evolution from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis. When combined with selective pressures, such propensities strongly influence a species’ evolutionary trajectory.  

This chapter introduces several theoretical concepts, though there is no need to delve deeply into them immediately. In most cases, I will opt for more accessible expressions rather than relying on these concepts. Next, we will examine how the first product of Adversarial Evolution—Grabbingism—arose.
