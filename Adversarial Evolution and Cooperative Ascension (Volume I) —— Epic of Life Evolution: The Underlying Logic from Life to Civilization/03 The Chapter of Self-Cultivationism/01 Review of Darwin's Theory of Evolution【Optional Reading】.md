In this chapter, we will first provide a brief review of the core concepts in classical evolutionary theory and point out the ambiguous parts within it. By reviewing and contrasting these concepts, we aim to facilitate a better understanding of the principles related to Adversarial Evolution. Next, we will introduce the concept of narrow-sense natural selection, followed by an exploration of the phenomena and basic principles of Adversarial Evolution—this constitutes the foundational theoretical section of this book. The content of this chapter involves some fundamental theories and may be somewhat dry. Readers with lower requirements for rigor or non-professional readers may skim through it quickly; this will not significantly affect the understanding of subsequent chapters.  

# A Review of Darwin's Theory of Evolution [Optional Reading]  

### Excessive Reproduction  

Excessive reproduction refers to the tendency of all living organisms to increase in number at a high rate. If every generation of organisms and their descendants were to fully realize their reproductive potential, the population numbers of most species would grow at a geometric progression. Darwin provided numerous examples to illustrate this point: even humans, who have relatively slow reproductive rates, can double their population in twenty-five years. At this rate, within less than a millennium, their descendants would have no room to stand. Linnaeus calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds, and its offspring each produced two seeds the following year, there would be one million such plants after twenty years; in reality, no plant has such a low reproductive capacity. Elephants have an extremely long reproductive cycle. Assuming an elephant gives birth to six calves between the ages of thirty and ninety, there would be 19 million elephants alive after 740 to 750 years.

This is not merely a theoretical construct. Darwin also noted that certain invasive plant species, upon establishing themselves on a small island and free from the constraints of natural enemies, climate, soil, and other factors, can spread across the entire island and become widespread within less than a decade. The examples mentioned above are not even the most prolific reproducers. True champions in this regard are far more impressive—for instance, the ocean sunfish (mola mola) can produce 300 million eggs in a single spawning. An ocean sunfish grows from 2.5 cm as a juvenile to 3 meters in length, a size increase of 60 million times. If all ocean sunfish larvae survived to adulthood, the Earth would be overrun by them within just a few generations.

Therefore, Darwin argued that excessive reproduction forms the basis of species evolution, providing the raw material for subsequent natural selection.  

### Genetic Variation  

Regarding genetic variation, Darwin first discussed variation under domestication—a shrewd choice. By starting from a perspective familiar to people of his time, he made the principles of evolutionary theory more accessible. He then proceeded to discuss genetic variation under natural conditions, a framework that aligns closely with reality. Since the discovery of the DNA double helix structure, the existence of genetic mechanisms has been definitively established. As for variation mechanisms, they have been extensively studied in the neutral theory of molecular biology. There is little controversy regarding genetic variation within evolutionary theory. In fact, inferring the evolutionary mechanism of genetic variation without prior knowledge of DNA as the genetic material stands as one of the great discoveries of classical evolutionary theory.  

### Struggle for Existence  

In classical evolutionary theory, the relationships of contention between organisms and their natural environment, between different species, and between individuals of the same species are collectively referred to as the "struggle for existence," which Darwin termed the "broad sense of struggle for existence." It is precisely this "broad sense" interpretation that introduced certain issues into classical evolutionary theory. To illustrate, Darwin provided examples: a plant growing at the edge of a desert struggling against drought to survive; mistletoe depending on apple trees and other hosts, thereby engaging in a struggle for existence with its hosts; and when excessive mistletoe growth causes host death, different mistletoe seedlings on the same branch competing with one another. Mistletoe using its fruit to entice birds to disperse its seeds also represents a struggle for existence against other fruit-bearing plants. In reality, [the concept of the broad sense of struggle for existence is marked by a degree of ambiguity and vagueness](). As we will see later, this ambiguity is akin to a small ant hole in the dike of classical evolutionary theory, misleading its explanations of biological behavior and human society. It introduced a seemingly minor yet consequential problem into evolutionary theory.  

The broad sense of struggle for existence in classical evolutionary theory encompasses the following aspects:  

#### Struggle for Existence with Nature  

In classical evolutionary theory, the evolutionary pressures organisms face in overcoming environmental challenges are categorized under the struggle for existence. This includes overcoming extreme heat, cold, aquatic, or arid environments—all of which fall under this concept. For example, Darwin’s example of desert-edge plants struggling against drought. Similarly, the ability to overcome wind resistance, gravity, and water resistance is also classified as part of the "struggle for existence" in classical evolutionary theory.  

#### Inter-specific Struggle for Existence  

Inter-specific struggle is one of the primary forms of the struggle for existence. It is widespread, with each node in the food chain exemplifying inter-specific struggle—for instance, cats hunting mice and foxes preying on rabbits. We will not elaborate further on these here.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d609254-0a9c-4814-bf5f-9b16aa73aee7" /></p>  

#### Intra-specific Struggle for Existence  

Intra-specific struggle is also a common form of the struggle for existence. Classical evolutionary theory posits that intra-specific competition is more intense than inter-specific competition. Darwin noted in *On the Origin of Species*: "The struggle between the individuals of the same species is almost certainly the most severe, for they inhabit the same area, require the same resources, and face the same dangers." He provided examples: mixed planting of wheat varieties; mountain sheep and their variants being unable to coexist; different varieties of medicinal leeches kept together, with one variety starving; and one species of mouse replacing another during extreme weather. In Australia, introduced bees quickly eliminated the small, stingless native bees. However, the assertion that intra-specific competition is more intense than inter-specific competition warrants scrutiny. In subsequent chapters, we will explore how closely related genes employ sophisticated strategies to engage in cooperative behaviors.  

In summary, conflating different forms of the struggle for existence under the label of the "broad sense of struggle for existence" risks misunderstanding and may lead to incorrect inferences.  

### Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest  

In classical evolutionary theory, natural selection and survival of the fittest are also relatively vague concepts. Traditional evolutionary theory tends to subsume all forms of selection—including environmental selection, selection arising from inter-specific struggle, sexual selection, and selection from intra-specific struggle—under the term "natural selection." Using "natural selection" as a broad descriptor of selection processes easily leads to the inference that evolution always progresses toward greater adaptation to nature and increasing advancement (underlying this is the assumption that nature is objective and unchanging). In reality, many have recognized issues with the concept of natural selection: for example, while Engels broadly endorsed the framework of evolutionary theory, he astutely observed, "Selection based on greater adaptability to changing environments results in the survival of those better suited to these environments. However, such adaptation can be either evolutionary or degenerative—for instance, adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle is always degenerative." He also recognized the complexity of biological relationships, noting they "encompass both conscious and unconscious cooperation, as well as conscious and unconscious struggle," and cannot be universally explained by the concept of the struggle for existence.  

Others have been more direct, arguing that the phrase "survival of the fittest" is a "tautology" in linguistic logic—since those who survive are by definition "fit," and the fit are those who survive. They thus contend that "survival of the fittest" is a meaningless statement. This critique holds some merit. In reality, [as we will see later, both the mechanisms of evolutionary selection and the criteria for measuring evolutionary fitness are far more complex than described by classical evolutionary theory, particularly for individuals engaged in intra-specific struggle with closely related genes; their selection mechanisms are much more intricate than classical theory posits]().  

### Ambiguities in Darwin’s Theory of Evolution  

Classical Darwinian evolutionary theory contains ambiguous concepts in its exposition, leading to potential misinterpretations. This is largely due to the simplifications made by its proponents to streamline the theory’s presentation, but these simplifications have rendered the theory prone to misunderstanding. As previously noted: on one hand, classical evolutionary theory does not distinguish between "struggle" behaviors arising from adaptation to nature and individual struggles arising from intra-specific survival—it ambiguously subsumes these under the labels "struggle for existence" and "broad sense adaptation." On the other hand, classical evolutionary theory overemphasizes competitive relationships between individuals (largely due to Darwin’s focus on the animal kingdom) while neglecting cooperative mechanisms between individuals and competitive mechanisms between groups. [Furthermore, evolutionary theory has overly emphasized the role of natural selection, downplaying the mutual selection between individuals. This has led to a latent misunderstanding—namely, that the eliminated species are those unadapted to nature]().

In addition, classical evolutionary theory posits that the course of biological evolution can be summarized as "from simplicity to complexity; from lower to higher forms." When combined with the aforementioned theory of Survival of the Fittest, its underlying implication seems to be that life achieves evolution from simplicity to complexity and from lower to higher forms through the struggle for existence. However, as subsequent chapters of this text will reveal, the actual mechanism is nearly the opposite. Precisely due to these omissions, evolutionary theory sometimes derives conclusions that are entirely contrary to actual circumstances, which is why transplanting evolutionary theory into human society often leads to numerous fallacies. These issues will be thoroughly clarified in the subsequent chapters of this book. Having briefly reviewed classical evolutionary theory, we may now proceed to expound upon the principles of Adversarial Evolution.
