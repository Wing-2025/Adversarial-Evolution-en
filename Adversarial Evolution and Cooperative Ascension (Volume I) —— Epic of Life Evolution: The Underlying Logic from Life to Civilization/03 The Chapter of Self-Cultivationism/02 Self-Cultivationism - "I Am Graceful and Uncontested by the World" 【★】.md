### The Distinction Between "Progressive Evolution" and "Evolution"  
The reason this book frames its arguments around "Adversarial Evolution" rather than the more commonly used "Adversarial Progressive Evolution" is to emphasize the distinction between "Progressive Evolution" and "Evolution." "Progressive Evolution" refers only to the development of biological traits that arise from mutations favorable for adapting to enduring [natural environments](). For example: the evolution of photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy with greater efficiency; the evolution of wings to conform more closely to fluid dynamics, enabling longer flight with less energy consumption; the evolution of eyes to achieve sharper vision, distinguishing more colors, and expanding the visual field; the evolution of bones to support greater strength with less material; the evolution of claws to withstand greater pressure; and the evolution of brains to perform the same tasks with less energy (which is achievable—those with computer science backgrounds know that algorithms determine energy consumption for tasks; for instance, a sorting task relying on a bubble sort algorithm would consume more energy than one using a quicksort algorithm). For these cases, referring to the process as "Progressive Evolution" is appropriate. The implicit assumption of "Progressive Evolution" is a hierarchy of superiority, a transition from inferior to superior. [Since natural physical laws remain nearly constant, greater adaptation to these laws confers advantages that are also nearly permanent, making the term "Progressive Evolution" a useful way to understand this process.]()  

["Evolution," however, differs. While it also results from adaptation to external environments, the "external environment" itself is continuously changing, causing the adaptability of evolved traits to shift accordingly. Thus, the direction of "Evolution" is not fixed—it changes with the environment—and there is no inherent hierarchy of superiority.]() For most biological traits, they merely adapt to temporary, non-permanent external conditions. Therefore, referring to the development of these traits as "Evolution" is more fitting. I have prepared the following table to provide a general comparative overview.  

| Adaptation Scope | Stability | Genetic Manipulation Space | Applicable Language | Examples |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Physical and Mathematical Laws | Extremely High | Extremely Low | Evolution | More excellent algorithms (higher efficiency with the same computational cost), optimized wing structures, optimized fish body shapes (reducing wind and water resistance with the same amount of material) |
| Natural Environment | High | Low | Evolution | Becoming more adapted to aquatic, dry, light - less, aerobic, and anaerobic environments, etc. |
| Interspecific Struggle Environment | Medium | Medium | Adversarial Evolution | Gazelles running faster than their predators; insects evolving protective coloration to evade predators; parasitic organisms evolving parasitic behaviors (when the predators or hosts change, some traits lose their significance) |
| Intraspecific Struggle Environment | Low | High | Adversarial Evolution | Sperm competition, infanticide, intraspecific brood parasitism, widow birds evolving long tails for sexual selection (these are often intraspecific "in - group competition" behaviors that are detrimental to natural fitness) |  

### Life Shaping the Environment—The Great Oxidation Event  
Most life on Earth today relies on oxygen to survive; many animals would suffocate without it. Even oxygen-producing plants require oxygen for respiration. However, oxygen was not always present in Earth’s atmosphere. When the planet formed 4.6 billion years ago, the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Oxygen began accumulating only 2.5 billion years ago, with the emergence of the first bacteria capable of using sunlight to decompose carbon dioxide and consume carbon atoms, thereby producing increasing amounts of oxygen. This oxygen, now vital to Earth’s life, is a product of ancient biological activity. This demonstrates that [organisms can fundamentally influence their environment—shaping it—and the environment, in turn, acts on life, directly shaping its future evolutionary trajectory.]()  

For ancient life, the ability to decompose and utilize carbon dioxide was an "advantage." Yet when they released oxygen, it "poisoned" the anaerobic life dominant at the time. Later lifeforms instead adapted to and utilized oxygen as an "advantage." Some "advantages" persist until the annihilation of universal physical and chemical laws; others endure for billions, tens of millions, or mere decades—or even become detrimental over time. These stories will be explored later. Life’s "shaping" of the environment is generally slow and gradual, creating the illusion of environmental stability. However, from an evolutionary perspective, this influence is constant; the Great Oxidation Event is but one example, with such impacts occurring continuously in localized regions. [In fact, the ecological environment can be viewed as an "extension" of life, governed by genetic and hereditary laws, and thus also subject to the laws of Adversarial Evolution discussed later.]()  

### Narrow-Sense Natural Selection and Self-Cultivationism  
Natural selection driven by unchanging natural laws—such as solar energy, light imaging, wind, and fluid dynamics—is termed "Narrow-Sense Natural Selection" in this text. The evolution of eyes and wings are classic examples of this. Genetic strategies adapted to Narrow-Sense Natural Selection are referred to as "Self-Cultivationism" (abbreviated from the phrase "cultivating the self to govern the family"). This strategy focuses on enhancing an individual’s "self-cultivation" to better adapt to enduring natural laws, while paying little attention to changes in the "biological environment"—including predators, prey, and conspecifics. A loose analogy: Self-Cultivationism resembles cultivators in certain web novels who, through serendipity, discover unchanging natural laws (constant in each narrative) and thereby enhance their mastery of nature, increasing their fitness.  

Traits evolved through Self-Cultivation primarily improve an organism’s ability to utilize and adapt to natural laws—examples include the streamlined body shapes of birds to reduce wind resistance and the fusiform bodies of fish. These traits have reappeared repeatedly across different branches of the phylogenetic tree, a phenomenon known as evolutionary convergence.

Because natural physical laws are unchanging, the evolutionary direction of traits aligned with these laws remains consistent. In contrast, some genetic strategies allocate biological resources to resolving intra- or interspecific conflicts or acquiring sexual resources; the evolutionary direction of these traits is fluid, heavily influenced by the evolutionary outcomes of other organisms. [Thus, Narrow-Sense Natural Selection refers to selective pressures excluding those imposed by "biological environments" governed by genes.]()  

The former—directional, "Progressive Evolution"—represents only a fraction of biological evolution. The latter—evolving new traits in response to the biological environment—likely constitutes the true, submerged portion of the evolutionary iceberg. This will be the focus of subsequent chapters. [Indeed, it is not an overstatement to say that "Progressive Evolution" is merely a "special case" of "Adversarial Evolution."]()

Here, a brief clarification is necessary: the first volume of this book will sequentially introduce genetic strategies such as Self-Cultivationism, Grabbingism, and Mutualistic Cooperationism. The term "ism" here is an anthropomorphic and simplified descriptor, referring to a genetic strategy preference in organisms. This preference may be driven by simple conditioned reflexes or involve complex emotional factors. Moreover, it pertains to specific behaviors; a single complex organism may exhibit behaviors aligned with different "isms." For simplicity, however, we will occasionally categorize organisms as exemplifying a particular "ism."  

### Broad-Sense Natural Selection (Optional Reading)  
I argue that conflating concepts like Sexual Selection and Kin Selection under "natural selection" can lead to misunderstanding. Therefore, when unifying all selection types under one framework, I use the term "Broad-Sense Natural Selection" (where "broad" implies that all selection is, in the long term, natural selection). Broad-Sense Natural Selection includes, but is not limited to, the previously discussed Narrow-Sense Natural Selection. It encompasses both unchanging Narrow-Sense Natural Selection and dynamic selection arising from interactions between organisms, such as the commonly cited Sexual Selection and Kin Selection. The forms of Broad-Sense Natural Selection are fluid and dynamic, causing Broad-Sense Fitness to evolve accordingly.  

This can be analogized to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): in Narrow-Sense Natural Selection, the loss function is fixed, whereas in Broad-Sense Natural Selection, the loss function itself is a discriminative network that evolves through adversarial dynamics. This borrows terminology from algorithmic theory to aid understanding; readers without technical backgrounds need not worry, as these concepts will be revisited.  

### Broad-Sense Fitness (Optional Reading)  
Broad-Sense Natural Selection corresponds to "Broad-Sense Fitness" (or "Broad-Sense Adaptation"). It refers to the average contribution of a genotype to future generations over one or more generations. Notably, genotypes with high Broad-Sense Fitness are not necessarily adapted to Narrow-Sense Natural Selection. For example, a genotype may excel in Sexual Selection but allocate resources to non-functional organs. Alternatively, it may attract mates but also predators. Thus, it is not necessarily adapted to Narrow-Sense Natural Selection.

In truth, inclusive fitness is a rather complex concept, for it pertains not only to contributions to an individual's own genes but also to contributions to closely related genes. The strength or weakness of inclusive fitness is defined by broad sense natural selection, which in itself is a highly complex concept. As you progress through the first volume of this book, your understanding of this concept will deepen progressively. Nevertheless, comprehending it from the reverse perspective remains relatively accessible: inclusive fitness essentially measures the probability that an individual's genes (or its closely related, similar genes) will be passed on over subsequent years. The higher this probability, the greater the fitness. What organisms ultimately pursue is inclusive fitness. Therefore, even the most exemplary Self-Cultivationists—those genetic strategies that solely seek adaptation to narrow sense natural selection—are often not the ultimate winners in evolutionary history. Among particularly successful species, it is frequently individuals that abandon adapting to nature and instead adapt to intra-specific competition who achieve success. For Self-Cultivationists, their trajectory aligns more closely with the scenario described by classical evolutionary theory: namely, the struggle for existence and Survival of the Fittest. Moreover, only Self-Cultivationism bears no trace of Adversarial Evolution, instead manifesting a relatively unidirectional evolutionary trajectory. This is attributable to the constancy of the physical laws governing the objective natural environment.
