# Does Long-Term Group Selection Exist?  
The examples mentioned earlier fall under short-term group selection—cases where an individual's group-beneficial behavior quickly yields results, and such benefits soon accrue to the individual or its closely related genes. These group selection phenomena are relatively easy to explain. But does long-term group selection exist? If so, how does it counteract the short-term advantages of grabbing? As discussed previously, academia has long criticized group selection theory for its difficulty in explaining the Altruism Paradox. This criticism is indeed valid, [for long-term group selection cannot counteract the short-term trends of individual selection. However, if we reorient our perspective: what if long-term group selection "selects" not "individuals," but rather "mechanisms that counteract grabbing and maintain cooperation"?]() This reframing alleviates the confusion. In reality, over billions of years of "trial and error," long-term group selection ultimately "selects" mechanisms that avoid grabbing and sustain cooperation, and individuals are in turn "selected" through these mechanisms. Examples include Superorganismalism, the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Genetic selection, individual selection, group selection, long-term selection, and short-term selection are actually unified and free from contradiction. Long-term group selection examples often operate at the species level, occur infrequently, and thus are less commonly cited. Moreover, their results are typically encoded as underlying mechanisms, making them less visible. Below, we explore this phenomenon through the origin of sexual reproduction.  

## The Origin of Sexual Reproduction [Optional Reading]  
Most familiar organisms we observe today engage in sexual reproduction, with the majority being dioecious (separate male and female individuals). Why is this the case? Undoubtedly, the two sexes serve the primary biological function of reproduction, which might seem unremarkable. Yet, the biological world hosts diverse reproductive modes, including the simplest asexual reproduction, which further subdivides into fission, budding, spore formation, fragmentation, and vegetative reproduction. More complex sexual reproduction includes parthenogenesis (virgin birth) and bisexual reproduction, with bisexual reproduction itself manifesting in forms such as hermaphroditism, sequential hermaphroditism, and sex reversal. Among these, the most cumbersome mode is fixed dioecious reproduction. Intriguingly, this most cumbersome mode is also the most common. Why? To answer this, we must trace its origins.  

### The Costs of Sexual Reproduction  
First, [sexual reproduction incurs significant costs. Macroscopically, these include ecological costs such as time, energy, and risks associated with seeking, competing for, and selecting mates. Microscopically, in isogamous organisms that reproduce via cell division, meiosis takes 5 to 100 times longer than mitosis, increasing reproductive difficulty and reducing success rates.]() Additionally, anisogamous (dioecious) species bear a unique burden: [the cost of producing male individuals.]() If dioecious individuals and parthenogenetic individuals have equal reproductive capacity, the number of reproductively capable offspring from dioecious individuals will be halved (as half the resources are allocated to males, who are non-reproductive). By the grandchild generation, this number drops to a quarter, creating a significant genetic disadvantage for dioecious species.  

#### Seeking a Mate Is Never Easy  
In human society, securing a spouse requires preparing material resources (e.g., housing, vehicles) and enduring sexual selection—no trivial task. In the biological world, seeking a mate is equally arduous. Some animals invest years of resource accumulation to partake in life’s final "sexual carnival"—fulfilling the mission of mating. Mayflies and periodical cicadas exemplify this.  

##### Mayflies—A Day of Life for Mating  
Mayflies inhabit various freshwater habitats, feeding on algae, particles, or aquatic invertebrates. Aquatic nymphs undergo 10–50 molts over weeks to years (or longer) before entering the terrestrial, winged subimago stage. Subimagos then molt into mature adults. Adults neither eat nor drink, with lifespans as short as hours or a few days. They allocate nearly all energy to mating, hence the saying "born at dawn, dead by dusk"—a spectacle of profound intensity.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd173d6-eec6-4132-aafb-f67ce053804a" /></p>  
*The Book of Songs (Cao Feng)*: "Mayflies' wings, their garments elegant; mayflies' wings, their attire resplendent." *Huainanzi*: "Cranes live a thousand years, wandering freely; mayflies are born at dawn and die by dusk, savoring their joy—their lifespan spans a day, at most three." *Huainanzi*: "Silkworms eat but do not drink, transforming in twenty-two days; cicadas drink but do not eat, molting in thirty days; mayflies neither eat nor drink, dying in three days."  

##### Periodical Cicadas—Mastering Prime Numbers for Safe Mating  
Periodical cicadas are among North America’s oldest insects. Nymphs live underground, feeding on tree root sap for 13 or 17 years (depending on species). When mature, vast numbers of nymphs emerge simultaneously, a spectacular event. They climb trees, molt into adults, and within weeks, adults meet, mate, lay eggs, and die. Eggs hatch into larvae, which return underground to await the next decade-long cycle.  

#### Sexual Parasitism—Sacrificing Autonomy to Reduce Costs  
For dioecious species, the costs of sex are high. With a 1:1 sex ratio, half of all resources are allocated to non-reproductive males—a poor investment, especially for species with sparse populations where males and females rarely meet. Many animals have evolved strategies to mitigate this, with reducing male investment being the simplest and most effective.  

##### Deep-Sea Anglerfish  
Deep-sea anglerfish, colloquially "lanternfish," are distinctive deep-sea creatures. The fleshy protrusion resembling a small lantern above their heads evolves from the first dorsal fin. Their coloration ranges from dark gray to deep brown, with massive heads, "crescent-shaped" mouths, and sharp, translucent teeth (anglerfish are far from "healthy" in appearance).  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e254d30c-f2a9-4b67-8ee0-d767d28629f0" /></p>  
The above describes only females. Most people are unfamiliar with males. These fish exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism: females are far larger, typically 0.8–1 meters long, while males are usually under 0.3 meters. In extreme cases, female length is 70 times that of males, and weight 500,000 times greater.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/154d0652-bd09-4bd5-8f9e-bf809f262899" /></p>  
Tiny male anglerfish spend their lives seeking females. In some species, males use highly sensitive olfactory systems to track female pheromones. In others, males rely on keen vision to detect the light emitted by females’ head appendages. Upon finding a female, the male latches onto her abdomen with its teeth, flipping upside down. Their tissues then fuse, including circulatory systems. Post-fusion, the male becomes part of the female, permanently dependent on her bloodstream for nutrients. Males grow larger in this state than they would freely. They survive as long as the female lives, enabling continued reproduction. In some species, a female may host multiple males—up to eight. When mating, both release sperm and eggs externally. Synchronization likely occurs via hormonal regulation. Males that fail to find a female within their first few months perish.  

##### Bonellia Males  
Bonellia males are only 1/500 the length of females, losing digestive and motor functions, and parasitize within the female uterus.  

##### Ceratioid Anglerfish Males  
Ceratioid males weigh only 85% of females, with poor independent survival. They attach to the female’s body with their mouths, feeding on her bodily fluids.  

##### Bone-Eating Worms (Osedax)  
Female Osedax host up to 100 males, each only 1/100,000 the female’s length. Larvae drift with ocean currents; those landing on females develop into males, while those landing on bones fix themselves, grow into adult females, and await male arrival.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a10aca06-dc9d-4112-8ee9-92630c61f104" /></p>  
In nature, males are often non-essential and "scaled down." Sometimes females even decide, "Males are unreliable—we’ll handle everything ourselves." One wonders if these stories might stir a touch of excitement among feminists.  

#### "Genetic Grabbing"—Sexual Reproduction Is Unstable  
Beyond high sexual costs, the more striking reality is that sexual reproduction is not an evolutionarily stable state, as many species exhibit a tendency to shift from sexual to asexual reproduction.

By applying artificial selection to laboratory fruit fly populations, researchers altered the recombination rates of specific gene loci and established parthenogenetic strains from sexually reproducing ancestors (Carson 1967; Brooks 1988). Furthermore, it has been observed that parthenogenetic strains often originate from sexually reproducing ancestors, with asexual reproduction documented in many sexually reproducing plant and animal species. However, in populations that have evolved to reproduce asexually, traits associated with sexual reproduction appear to degrade rapidly, making it unlikely for asexual individuals to revert to sexual reproduction in their reproductive mode (Normark et al.).  

##### Genetic Grabbing Tendency—The "Deceptive Parthenogenesis" Phenomenon  
Why does this phenomenon occur? The underlying principle is not difficult to infer. I tentatively term it the ["genetic grabbing tendency"](), which refers to the inclination of genes from both male and female gametes to maximize their own transmission to offspring. This is essentially a form of sexual conflict (a battle that begins even at the zygote stage), in which females hold absolute advantage—for the zygote is entirely under their control.  

How should we understand "genetic grabbing"? This concept is somewhat abstract, but it becomes clearer when grounded in known realities. In the section on "sexual conflict," I discussed scenarios where males suffer significant genetic losses—such as when female promiscuity results in offspring carrying genes not from the putative father, who then unwittingly raises another male’s progeny. This is a classic example of genetic grabbing.  

Imagine a female individual evolving the ability to bypass meiosis and directly initiate post-zygotic development using her own fully genetically complete oocytes—thus achieving parthenogenesis. Many sexually reproducing females can transition to parthenogenesis through only a few mutations (as seen in the aforementioned fruit flies), for they already possess the necessary genetic machinery, requiring only the "trigger" (though this process is impossible in higher mammals, a point I will address later). Parthenogenesis confers a genetic advantage: henceforth, all her descendants—children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren—will carry 100% of her genes. Compared to the 1/8 genetic contribution in normal sexual reproduction, this represents a massive boost in genetic propagation.  

What makes this even more insidious is that males are often oblivious to this deception—they are unwitting victims. If the male is a mantis, he may sacrifice himself (consumed by the female) without passing on his genes. If a penguin, he expends enormous time and energy rearing offspring that carry none of his genes (while non-investing males may actually have higher reproductive success). For a male jacana, the plight is graver still: he painstakingly cares for chicks that may share no genetic material with him. These examples are hypothetical and do not reflect actual species behaviors; I term this conjectured phenomenon "deceptive parthenogenesis," as males initially lack the ability to detect it (they cannot perform genetic sequencing, after all).  

We may glimpse the evolutionary transition from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction in honeybees, observing how such deception arises. Male drones develop from unfertilized queen eggs (thus carrying no paternal genes), rendering them haploid. As students of biology know, haploids typically face challenges in meiosis. However, drones have evolved a "pseudo-meiosis" during sperm production—likely an evolutionary relic of their diploid past. In this process, spermatocytes undergo a modified meiosis: during the first division, chromosome number remains unchanged, but cytoplasm divides unequally. The larger cytoplasmic portion retains the nucleus, while the smaller degrades. The second division resembles mitosis: chromatids separate, and cytoplasm divides unequally again, with the larger portion (containing 16 chromosomes) developing into sperm, and the smaller degrading. Thus, one spermatocyte produces only one sperm, both haploid. This specialized process is termed "pseudo-meiosis."  

Drones can be viewed as genetic copies of their mother, who, leveraging her control over offspring production, seizes the genetic rights of her mate. Even more striking, the queen further appropriates the genetic agency of her offspring—numerous worker bees are rendered sterile "slaves." In exchange, these workers exhibit extreme loyalty, reliability, and altruism. Through hormonal signals and epigenetic regulation, the queen establishes an absolute, centralized "kingdom" of her own.  

Thus, [like all grabbing tendencies, we observe a "genetic grabbing tendency" in sexually reproducing females—the "deceptive parthenogenesis" inclination. Once evolved, this confers significant genetic advantages, propagating through the population and potentially driving the entire group to irreversible parthenogenesis]().  

##### Hypothesis of Viral Parthenogenesis  
While deceptive parthenogenesis is concerning, it is at least limited in male-mediated spread—males often invest little in parental care and have greater reproductive potential. A more alarming possibility is "viral parthenogenesis" (if it exists), where "deceptive parthenogens" produce male offspring carrying their genes. If such males mate with non-parthenogenetic females, and their female offspring inherit the grandmother’s parthenogenetic ability (a complex scenario), this would enable paternal transmission of parthenogenetic genes alongside maternal. This would exponentially enhance the spread of parthenogenesis, accelerating the population’s shift to asexuality. To date, no confirmed cases exist—this remains conjecture. I note it here due to its potential severity, pending future research.  

### Advantages of Sexual Reproduction  
From the above analysis, we conclude that [sexual reproduction incurs significant costs, is unstable, and readily degrades into asexuality, potentially being displaced by it. Why, then, is sexual reproduction so widespread?]() Nearly all eukaryotes engage in sexual reproduction, and most multicellular organisms rely on it as their primary mode of reproduction. To answer this, we must examine the advantages of sexual reproduction.  

#### Genetic Recombination—Complementation of Advantageous Genes  
The most critical advantage of sexual reproduction lies in genetic recombination. [In asexual reproduction, nearly all fitness gains depend on genetic mutations.]() Consider two asexual individuals, A and B, each with a beneficial mutation (a and b, respectively). A’s descendants cannot acquire b through hybridization with B’s descendants, nor can B’s descendants acquire a. They must independently undergo low-probability mutations to gain both traits. Given the rarity of mutations (e.g., ~1 in 100 million per human base pair), evolving both a and b would require enormous time and population size.  

In sexual reproduction, however, once a beneficial trait arises in one individual, natural selection drives its rapid spread through genetic recombination, combining it with other advantageous mutations to produce even fitter individuals.  

<p align="center">
  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd661bea-1be6-4bd4-90a1-829ab9f29b72" />
</p>  

Take honeybees: though drones are parthenogenetic, queen bees remain diploid and require drone fertilization—maintaining the benefits of genetic recombination. This unequal reproductive mechanism may be evolutionarily linked to their later development into social superorganisms. Genetic recombination has also evolved convergently across taxa: plants and animals use gamete fusion; bacteria engage in conjugation (unidirectional genetic transfer via a temporary cytoplasmic bridge); protozoa undergo conjugation (temporary fusion, exchange of haploid nuclei, and mutual fertilization).  

#### Genetic Recombination—Generating Genetic Diversity through Combinatorial Arrangement

### Genetic Recombination: Beyond Complementary Advantages  

Beyond enabling the complementation of advantageous traits, genetic recombination plays a critical role in maintaining biological genetic diversity. From the perspective of absolute evolution, biological diversity might seem less significant—after all, if organisms are evolving toward a "more advanced" direction, does diversity truly matter? However, when viewed through the lens of **Adversarial Evolution**, biological diversity becomes indispensable for a species' survival. Without genetic recombination, a species would face severe genetic homogenization. For instance, consider two evolutionary branches, A and B, each with traits a and b respectively. If trait a is superior to b, branch B may be eliminated by branch A, leaving only branch A. While this might seem unproblematic if A remains perpetually superior, Earth's biological environment, as I have repeatedly emphasized, operates under the laws of **Adversarial Evolution**. If A becomes excessively dominant, it will eradicate species that A suppresses, while creating greater ecological space for species that can counter A. Consequently, the broad - sense fitness of trait A will probabilistically decline over time. Conversely, species that counter B, having been suppressed and eliminated by A, will see their fitness probabilistically increase—so much so that B may one day surpass A in advantage.  

Another issue with genetic homogenization is vulnerability to targeted exploitation. Bacteria, viruses, predators, and parasites can more easily evolve **grabbing mechanisms** (resource - plundering strategies) by targeting the homogeneous phenotypes resulting from uniform genes. A real - world example is the banana: the most widely cultivated triploid banana today has extremely low genetic diversity, making entire plantations susceptible to collapse from a single pest or disease outbreak.  


### Genetic Recombination as a Gene Correction Mechanism  

Combining insights from genetic drift and the neutral theory of molecular evolution, we know that each generation of genes undergoes mutations (essentially copying errors) at a probabilistic rate. Most of these mutations are non - deleterious and thus not subject to the influence of broad - sense natural selection. However, many mutations are detrimental, causing the loss of beneficial traits, or neutral mutations may accumulate to become overtly harmful. These deleterious mutations can drastically reduce the fitness of offspring. Genetic drift theory demonstrates that small populations face a significantly heightened risk of losing beneficial traits.  

In sexual reproduction, due to the mechanism of genetic recombination, even if deleterious mutations accumulate to the point of reducing fitness, the affected lineage can still recombine its genes with healthy lineages to eliminate these harmful variations. Driven by broad - sense natural selection, such lineages can return to an adaptive trajectory. In contrast, in asexual or parthenogenetic (monosexual) reproduction systems, once an individual loses a trait or accumulates deleterious mutations, it and its descendants lose the chance to correct these errors. Unless beneficial traits re - evolve, they will face a crisis of drastically reduced fitness. In essence, the error - correction function of genetic recombination can be seen as an expression of its broader advantages.  


### Hybridization - Induced Mutation (Optional Reading)  

#### The Miracle of Distant Hybridization  

A striking phenomenon has been observed: distant hybridization—crossing genetically distant lineages—can rapidly generate new species. Darwin's finches, often called the "golden apple" of evolutionary theory, have revealed many such patterns. Over 40 years of observing finches in the Galápagos Islands, the Grants discovered that hybridizing two finch species can produce a new species in just three generations. These new species exhibit distinct differences from their parent species in song, beak shape, body size, and other traits. Similarly, the diversity of dogs, which emerged over just a few thousand years, has been achieved through artificial hybridization and selection.  

#### Adaptive Radiation  

Naturally occurring examples of "adaptive radiation" further illustrate this. The Hawaiian Islands host over 800 species of Drosophila, more than the combined diversity of Drosophila species worldwide. The cichlids of East Africa's Great Lakes may represent the most remarkable case of adaptive radiation: Lake Victoria alone contains over 200 species, and Lake Malawi has over 500—possibly up to 1,000. These fish vary dramatically in color, body size, teeth, and jaws, with corresponding adaptations in diet: some feed on insects, detritus, or algae attached to rocks; others consume plankton, mollusks, or even the scales, eyes, or flesh of other fish.  

In plants, the Hawaiian silverswords (Argyroxiphium), along with three closely related genera in the aster family, occupy diverse habitats—from bare volcanic rock to moist forests—and exhibit a wide range of growth forms, including shrubs, vines, trees, and creeping plants. Despite these striking phenotypic differences, most silversword hybrids remain fertile.

</p>

#### The Hybridization - Induced Mutation Hypothesis  

In Darwin's era, the underlying mechanisms of sexual reproduction were not fully understood, making it easier to accept that species change through the gradual accumulation of small variations—a process analogous to gradient descent in optimization algorithms, where adaptation progresses incrementally through a high - dimensional fitness landscape. However, with the recognition of genetic recombination in sexual reproduction, our understanding must shift: when individuals A and B recombine their genes, they act as heuristic agents for one another. Even for the same trait, this mechanism can produce offspring that are phenotypically distinct from both parents yet still adaptive. This process is faster than the "gradualism" traditionally envisioned, which helps explain why some adaptations, though requiring cumulative "gradual" changes, often involve intermediate stages of reduced fitness.  

This principle does not contradict gradualism, but it expands our perspective. Darwin, focusing primarily on mutation as the driver of variation, did not anticipate the role of genetic exchange, making it difficult for him to explain the rapid emergence of species during the Cambrian explosion. Classic evolutionary theory assumed evolution proceeded slowly and methodically, but we now recognize that even low - viability matings between marginal species can play a unique role in speciation—one that may help account for the accelerated species formation observed in the Cambrian.  

My personal hypothesis is that the benefits of hybridization extend beyond traditional understandings of genetic recombination. Simple recombination tends to produce "patchwork" organisms, but hybridization may involve more advanced mechanisms. Experimental evidence shows that new species arising from hybridization are not mere mosaics of their parents. Macroscopically, homologous genes from two species may act as mutual heuristics: if species A has a smaller head and homologous species B has a larger head, both having evolved high fitness in their respective environments, their hybrid offspring may inherit genetic information that "inspires" B to evolve even larger heads (rather than intermediate sizes), suggesting that head enlargement is an adaptive direction. For genetic loci where the two parents are nearly identical, the hybrid tends to preserve consistency. This mechanism could offer significant inspiration for optimizing deep learning networks, as the "old" gradient descent algorithm has constrained progress in network architecture and deep learning development.  


### Sexual Selection: An Accelerator and Heuristic Operator of Evolution (Optional Reading)  

In many sexually reproducing species, females invest disproportionately more in offspring, while males have excess reproductive resources. Consequently, females often hold the "right to choose" mates—a phenomenon known as **Sexual Selection**. In some species, sexual selection can accelerate evolutionary processes. Let us explore this with examples.  

#### Why Are Peacock Tails So Beautiful?  

First, we revisit the theory of sexual selection. Darwin noted that the peacock's elaborate tail, though a survival disadvantage, evolved because its sexual allure outweighs this cost: males with more attractive tails are less likely to be excluded from reproduction. Thus, sexual selection acts as a pre - filter for species survival, preceding narrow - sense natural selection (while academia often subsumes sexual selection under natural selection, this text distinguishes it from narrow - sense natural selection, **Virtue Selection**, and other concepts).  

A similar example is the long - tailed widowbird of Africa. Males are mostly black with orange flanks, about the size of sparrows, but during breeding season, their tail feathers grow up to 46 cm long. These males perform acrobatic displays—spinning and spiraling—resembling planes trailing banners. Yet, their tails are clearly a burden: they struggle to fly in wet weather and may crash to the ground. Why have peacocks and widowbirds evolved such seemingly maladaptive traits?

### How Sexual Selection Genes Are Inherited: The Crux of the Sexual Selection Theory  
The inheritance mechanism of sexual selection genes lies at the heart of the theory of Sexual Selection. Imagine the widowbirds of long ago, when their tails were exceptionally short. At that time, moderately long tails were advantageous for balance and flight control. By chance, a female widowbird, due to a genetic mutation, developed a "preference" gene for males with longer tails. Consequently, she chose to mate with males sporting longer tails. Their offspring inherited two types of genes: those for long tails and those for preferring long tails. Notably, only one of these genes might manifest phenotypically, as offspring are either male or female; regardless, both genes are passed down through generations.  

Under natural selection, individuals with longer tails became more likely to survive, leading to the proliferation of their descendants. Significantly, natural selection favored the long-tail genes *and* incidentally selected the "preference for long tails" sexual selection genes. Thus, female offspring also developed a preference for longer tails. Over generations, widowbird tails grew progressively longer—a process far swifter than evolution driven solely by natural selection. Unlike natural selection, which is a probabilistic, context-dependent process (prone to temporary ineffectiveness during periods of abundance), sexual selection is decisive: males with insufficiently long tails are immediately excluded from mating due to female scarcity. This eliminates the need for natural selection to cull them, accelerating evolutionary efficiency.  

---

### How Sexual Selection Accelerates Evolution  
Traditionally, it was believed that variation is directionless, with natural selection alone dictating evolutionary direction. However, the advent of sexual reproduction altered this dynamic, as evolutionary direction can now be more profoundly influenced by Sexual Selection. Individuals disfavored by females are unlikely to produce offspring, bypassing the need for their descendants to be eliminated by natural selection. The resources they would have occupied are thus redirected to sexually selected survivors, making Sexual Selection a purposeful "hand" guiding evolutionary direction. This significantly reduces evolutionary cycles and costs—provided the criteria of Sexual Selection are sound (echoing Lamarckism to some extent). Importantly, these criteria themselves are products of natural selection, rendering them generally valid, at least over certain periods. Hence, Sexual Selection often acts as an evolutionary accelerator, particularly in its early stages.  

---

### Sexual Selection Inertia and the Overfitting of "Excessive Evolution"  
Ironically, the simplicity and superficiality of Sexual Selection criteria—such as preferences for larger size, longer appendages, or specific shapes/colors—may only suit a single evolutionary phase. Once a population becomes dominated by individuals adhering to these rigid preferences, the group enters a paradoxical state of blind selection. The widowbird exemplifies this: Sexual Selection rapidly extends their tails beyond the length optimal for survival. Even if moderately tailed individuals are better adapted, they fail to secure mates and are eliminated, driving the population toward increasingly elongated tails. At this stage, Sexual Selection’s evolutionary direction directly opposes adaptation to the natural environment, creating an "excessive evolution" driven by inertia. Only the elimination of the "preference for longer tails" genes can rescue the species from this trajectory.  

<p align="center"><img width="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16657e53-0ab8-4de7-9827-ffb60ba36c21" /><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac56120-5892-46b0-81cd-a21117868640" /></p>  

Many hypothesize that the Irish elk (*Megaloceros giganteus*) met extinction due to such Sexual Selection inertia. Standing at ~2.1 meters tall, it bore the largest antlers among deer—up to 3.65 meters wide and 90 pounds in weight—before going extinct ~7,700 years ago. Observations of horned animals reveal that larger antlers signal higher status, attracting more mates and establishing dominance hierarchies during male contests, thereby minimizing daily aggression. Yet, these antlers served no practical purpose—they were a burden. Driven by Sexual Selection, antlers grew ever larger, reducing natural fitness until the species could no longer adapt to environmental changes (a trend with parallels in human society).  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b63a9c-053b-416b-9a60-f2fa0764372a" /></p>  

In summary, despite the drawbacks of sexual reproduction—including the "sexual cost" (investing in males, seeking mates) and instability from deceptive parthenogenesis—its advantages are profound: genetic recombination (facilitating advantageous gene complementation, diversity, and error correction), hybrid mutations, and heuristic Sexual Selection. Macroevolutionary data supports this: over 3 billion years of life on Earth, 2 billion years were spent in slow, asexual evolution, with the pace accelerating dramatically in the last 1 billion years—attributed not only to environmental shifts (e.g., the rise of oxygen) but also to the emergence and spread of sexual reproduction. These advantages constitute the intrinsic evolutionary drivers of sexual reproduction. Having explored its origins, we now confront a paradox: *Why is sexual reproduction stable, given its tendency to revert to asexual forms (as per Murphy’s Law)?* The answer lies in our primary focus—**Group Selection**.

### Group Selection: Preventing Species from Sinking into Asexual Reproduction  

#### The Evolutionary Tendency of Parthenogenesis  
As previously discussed, parthenogenesis (a form of asexual reproduction) exemplifies an "easily evolvable tendency" akin to other grabbing behaviors. Its short-term benefits are substantial: reduced mate-seeking costs, elimination of the "male reproductive cost," and potential for "deceptive parthenogenesis"—a genetic grabbing strategy exploiting mates. These advantages make parthenogenesis appealing for individual short-term fitness.  

Parthenogenesis is not rare in nature: it is widespread in plants and common in animals, particularly insects. Aphids, for example, reproduce parthenogenetically during summer (producing only female offspring) but revert to sexual reproduction in winter. Other insects with parthenogenetic capabilities include bees and stick insects. Among vertebrates, parthenogenesis occurs in amphibians (frogs, salamanders), reptiles (lizards, snakes, including Komodo dragons), and fish (loaches, some sharks, and the smalltooth sawfish—now critically endangered).  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc799c3-f582-4427-881d-cb618510aafa" /></p>  

Even endothermic animals (warm-blooded species) exhibit parthenogenesis under human care, including pigeons, chickens, and turkeys.  

#### The Drawbacks of Parthenogenesis  
Setting aside debated advantages of sexual reproduction (e.g., hybrid mutations, evolutionary acceleration), parthenogenesis is myopic. It forfeits genetic recombination, leaving species with low genetic diversity. A single pathogen could devastate an entirely parthenogenetic population, as demonstrated by historical extinctions of asexual lineages. Thus, while parthenogenesis benefits individuals short-term, it imperils populations long-term—highlighting the critical role of Group Selection in stabilizing sexual reproduction.

Moreover, drastic natural changes, rapid advancements of natural predators, abrupt shifts in food sources, and other such phenomena may all leave slow-evolving parthenogenetic organisms unable to keep pace with the "environment." From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the adaptive response speed of parthenogenesis is significantly slower than that of sexual reproduction, making it highly likely to fall short in intense adversarial evolutionary processes. It is important to note, however, that such failures do not occur immediately after the emergence of parthenogenesis; thus, the disadvantages of parthenogenesis manifest primarily in the long term. Researchers have found that [most asexual lineages go extinct over time, which explains why few ancient asexual organisms exist today.]( )  

### The "Two-Sex Paradox" – Another Form of the "Altruism Paradox"  
If we follow a logic similar to the "Altruism Paradox"—where the presence of a non-altruistic individual in an altruistic group would grant that individual higher fitness, thereby outcompeting other altruistic individuals, and thus proving that "altruism" is difficult to sustain—we might similarly argue that the emergence of a parthenogenetic individual within a sexually reproducing species would allow it to gain higher fitness through "genetic grabbing" and reduced reproductive costs, thereby outcompeting other sexually reproducing individuals. If this logic holds, why do sexually reproducing species predominate in the biological world? And why are parthenogenetic species often relatively recent evolutionary offshoots of sexually reproducing species, many of which still retain vestiges of incomplete sexual reproduction?  

### Group Selection as a Plausible Explanation  
I posit that Group Selection offers a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. While parthenogenesis enhances short-term individual fitness, it carries significant long-term fitness risks. As we will later observe, nature has evolved numerous mechanisms to prevent the transition from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction—at minimum, many mechanisms greatly increase the difficulty of such evolutionary shifts. Consequently, parthenogenesis does not emerge easily; once it does, parthenogenetic lineages (or entire clades) face future extinction due to their reduced adaptability to environmental changes. Under this Group Selection mechanism, sexual reproduction—an approach that prioritizes long-term benefits despite significant short-term costs—has become the dominant reproductive mode in plants and animals. Notably, for sexually reproducing lineages that have persisted long-term on Earth, additional mechanisms must evolve to safeguard the interests of both sexes. As previously emphasized, "any cooperative phenomenon that withstands long-term scrutiny must be underpinned by mechanisms countering grabbing-driven evolution." These mechanisms themselves are the product of Group Selection. Given the lengthy timeframe of Group Selection, such mechanisms are exceptionally "precious," akin to humanity's Virtue Selection mechanism.  

Next, let us examine the mechanisms "invented by nature" to prevent "genetic grabbing" between the sexes.  

## Preventing Unisexual Reproduction at the Fundamental Mechanism Level  
Under Group Selection, not only have many parthenogenetic species been eliminated, but mechanisms to resist the evolution toward parthenogenesis have also gradually emerged.  

### Resisting Parthenogenesis – The Origin of Sex Chromosomes  
Approximately 150 million years ago, the XY sex-determination system became established in viviparous mammals. The X and Y chromosomes likely evolved from autosomes. The Y chromosome underwent dramatic changes, while the X chromosome remained relatively stable; yet both retain traces of their autosomal origins. This process established a system where mammalian sex is determined by chromosome composition: XX for females and XY for males. Furthermore, genetic recombination between the X and Y chromosomes has been proven harmful to offspring, potentially causing male offspring to lose essential Y-chromosome genes or female offspring to gain non-essential genes typically found only on the Y chromosome. Today, the Y chromosome has largely shed regions capable of recombination. Within its remaining condensed 60 million base pairs (approximately 95% of which constitute the male-specific region of the Y-chromosome, MSY), the Y chromosome is highly insulated and cannot recombine with the X chromosome.  

Consider the characteristics of sexual reproduction under this model. Since females have an XX genotype, no Y chromosomes exist in their somatic cells. Thus, even if a female evolves parthenogenesis, such reproduction cannot produce male offspring. Parthenogenesis without male offspring can only propagate through the maternal line—a far less potent mode of spread compared to "viral parthenogenesis," which could spread through males. For mammals with the XY sex system, this fundamental mechanism eliminates the possibility of "viral parthenogenesis." Additionally, to prevent the loss of the Y chromosome, the Y chromosome has developed numerous "palindromic structures," enabling self-repair through intrachromosomal recombination.  

### Resisting Parthenogenesis – Imprinting Genes  
The increasingly prominent field of epigenetics has revealed another, more complex mechanism to resist the regression from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction: the Imprinting Gene Mechanism. The origins of genomic imprinting may trace back to early mammals approximately 150 million years ago. Fundamentally, imprinting means that at certain loci in the human genome (totaling around 100 genes), the expression of DNA depends on which parent transmitted the gene. Despite potentially similar sequences, the expression of these genes differs. Sperm and egg cells carry chemical markers—methyl groups—attached to some genes, a process called methylation. When the DNA from sperm and egg combines in the embryo, these markers activate or silence specific genes. In some cases, the maternal copy of a gene is activated, while the paternal copy is silenced.  

Since the mid-1980s, experiments by Azim Surani and others have confirmed that mammalian reproduction is not merely a delivery system. It is not sufficient for a biological father to provide sperm to a mother's egg, fusing two haploid genomes into a diploid nucleus. What matters is that half the DNA comes from the father and half from the mother. If both copies originate from one parent, developmental issues arise, preventing healthy embryonic growth.  

Scientists created mouse zygotes containing only paternal or only maternal DNA. After transferring these in vitro zygotes into mouse uteruses, no lab succeeded in producing viable mice. However, these zygotes could develop abnormally in the uterus for a period. The nature of this abnormality varied depending on whether the chromosomes were maternally or paternally derived. In both cases, very few embryos formed, and they were small and developmentally delayed. Embryos with exclusively maternal chromosomes displayed underdeveloped placental tissue. Those with exclusively paternal chromosomes developed even more slowly but produced excessive placental tissue.  

Attempts to mix cells with purely maternal or paternal chromosomes to form embryos also failed to produce viable offspring. Testing revealed that all embryonic tissues originated from purely maternal cells, while placental tissues derived from purely paternal cells. Thus, under the "lock" of imprinted genes, parthenogenesis is impossible in mammals: a healthy fetus requires the "key" of combining gametes from both parents (with correctly methylated regions).  

This demonstrates that organisms invest significant evolutionary effort to prevent genetic grabbing and promote cooperation—driven by Adversarial Evolution, not merely "adaptation to nature." Similar dynamics occur in humans. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS), each affecting approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals, exemplify this. PWS presents with low birth weight, weak muscles, and difficulty feeding in infancy; affected children later develop insatiable hunger, dangerous obesity, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. AS is characterized by severe intellectual disability, small brain size, limited speech, and frequent, unprovoked laughter (clinically termed "happy puppet" syndrome).  

Scientists have discovered that some PWS patients have two entirely normal copies of chromosome 15—no deletions or mutations—yet still develop the syndrome. Further investigation revealed that in these cases, both chromosome 15 copies are maternally derived, with no paternal contribution (a condition called uniparental disomy). In 1991, a team at the Institute of Child Health in London showed that some AS cases result from the inverse scenario: children inherit two normal copies of chromosome 15, both paternally derived. Thus, offspring inheriting both chromosome copies from one parent are unhealthy.

The number of imprinted genes is actually very small, accounting for less than 1% of all protein-coding genes. All cells in the body exhibit DNA methylation patterns in imprinted control regions, which indicate whether a chromosome copy originates from the paternal or maternal parent. This reveals something obvious about imprinted regions: after sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote, these regions must have avoided the subsequent reprogramming process. Otherwise, once all methylation marks were erased, they could no longer indicate their parental origin. Just as IAP retrotransposons retain methylation during zygotic reprogramming, there must be mechanisms that protect imprinted regions during methylation erasure. Although the exact process remains unclear, this protection is critical for normal development and health. (The above cases are excerpted from *The Genetic Revolution*).  

One of the profound implications underlying the "Imprinting Gene Mechanism" is likely to prevent the occurrence of parthenogenesis, and also to guard against "pathenogenesis" (if possible). This is an extraordinarily sophisticated strategy, as it causes genes from both parents to exhibit completely different expression patterns under distinct methylation mechanisms. [These methylation rules function like cryptographic keys—each gender holds a unique key, and individuals of the same gender cannot fully "unlock" the system. Only through the cooperation of both sexes, with genetic contributions from both, can healthy offspring be produced.]() This ingenious mechanism is probably the result of Group Selection, with its "purpose" still being to maintain cooperation and prevent genetic grabbing.  

From this, we can make a bold conjecture: under the influence of Group Selection, many species should evolve various mechanisms to resist the shift toward unisexual reproduction—mechanisms that counteract the prioritization of short-term gains over long-term interests. These mechanisms await discovery by scientists.  

### Hydatidiform Moles  
Some readers may think that such experimental means—genetic grabbing through altering offspring genetic composition—only occur in laboratories and are rare in natural evolution. However, the biological world is full of wonders, and we occasionally observe male genetic grabbing strategies. This phenomenon has been documented in humans: approximately 1 in 1,500 human pregnancies results in a uterus containing only a placenta without an embryo. This placenta is abnormal, covered in fluid-filled, grape-like masses—hence the term "hydatidiform mole," which occurs in up to 1% of pregnancies in certain Asian populations.  

These pregnant individuals often experience more rapid weight gain and severe morning sickness, sometimes reaching extreme levels. These symptoms may stem from abnormally high hormone production by the rapidly growing placental structure. Hydatidiform moles develop from oocytes that, for unknown reasons, have lost their nuclei before fertilization. In about 80% of cases, such an enucleated oocyte is penetrated by a single sperm, whose haploid genome is then duplicated to form a diploid genome. In roughly 20% of cases, two sperm fertilize the oocyte simultaneously. In both scenarios, the fertilized oocyte has the correct number of chromosomes (46), but all DNA originates from the father. (Excerpted from *The Genetic Revolution*).  

If males could skillfully manipulate this phenomenon, such "male trickery" would amount to using females to facilitate parthenogenesis, granting the male significant short-term genetic benefits. Some might criticize the Imprinting Gene Mechanism for causing 1% of pregnancies to result in abnormal moles. But we must not blame it—this very mechanism prevents a nightmarish future: suppose there were no hydatidiform mole issue, and sperm possessed a "cheating mechanism" to discard the oocyte's chromosomes and develop embryos (and fertile offspring) independently. Such a cheating mechanism would spread through subsequent generations, evolving ever greater sophistication—from 1% to 100% efficiency. Eventually, all maternal genes from mates would fail to be inherited, while these cheaters gained overwhelming genetic advantage, dominating the population. This would eliminate genetic recombination, drastically reducing genetic diversity and environmental adaptability, accelerating the population's extinction.  

Fortunately, human mechanisms prevent such genetic grabbing—albeit at the cost of miscarriage, which represents the minimal long-term cost required. Thus, we see that [avoiding grabbing and maintaining cooperation is never easy or effortless; the laws of Adversarial Evolution are rife with hidden struggles and undercurrents. Humans, equipped with such remarkable mechanisms, are truly nature's darlings and marvels of life's history.]()  

## Long-Term Group Selection 【★★】  
Having discussed this, I can now address a prior question: why are hermaphroditism, sequential hermaphroditism, and sex change less advantageous than gonochorism (separate sexes)? My hypothesis is that hermaphroditism and related reproductive modes more readily evolve toward parthenogenesis. Only by strictly separating males and females can genetic grabbing be more effectively prevented. Gonochorism, particularly under the constraints of the Imprinting Gene Mechanism—[functioning like a combination lock, where a single gamete cannot "unlock" healthy development—forces the species to engage in bisexual reproduction, which benefits the population as a whole.]()  

Long-Term Group Selection is often dismissed by academia as nonexistent, as short-term individual interests act like a trap: even if they harm long-term interests, individuals are compelled to succumb. In reality, [Long-Term Group Selection first evolves mechanisms to avoid such short-term traps.]() With these foundational mechanisms, individual genes can transcend local optima and ascend to greater heights. Thus, [while Group Selection does not directly produce altruism, it generates mechanisms that nurture altruism.]()  

This section focuses on the origins of bisexuality to illustrate how Group Selection solves problems that Individual Selection cannot, at the mechanistic level. Though Long-Term Group Selection cases are not easily observed, I believe they are widespread. All mechanisms that seemingly contradict narrow natural selection are likely Group-Selected adaptations to resist grabbing and maintain cooperation, embodying the "Creator's" highest wisdom.  

### "Individual Short-Sightedness Trap"—The True Internal Cause of Dinosaur Extinction  
Even if Group Selection fails to form foundational "grabbing-resistance" mechanisms, large-scale Group Selection patterns will still cause species with severe internal grabbing to self-deplete until extinction, ceding survival and "experimental" space to more cooperative species. As previously noted, most asexual (unisexual) reproductive lineages go extinct over time, explaining why few ancient parthenogenetic species persist today—most extant parthenogenetic species are relatively recent, retaining vestiges of incomplete sexual reproduction.  

Additionally, we observe animals endangered by parthenogenesis, such as the smalltooth sawfish (though some argue they evolved parthenogenesis as a response to endangerment). Similar dynamics apply to other grabbing behaviors: avian intraspecific brood parasitism, for example, was only recently documented extensively. Intraspecific brood parasitism drastically reduces group fitness, incurring multiple costs: species must evolve egg-recognition abilities, their offspring face predation or eviction from nests, and energy diverted to parasitism and anti-parasitism weakens other capabilities. While the immediate cause of extinction might be external—e.g., reduced predation efficiency leading to mass starvation during a famine—long-term internal drivers are the grabbing behaviors themselves.  

Extending this logic, the internal cause of dinosaur extinction likely stems from widespread intraspecific grabbing. Growing evidence indicates intense intra-dinosaur conflict, driving individual body size enlargement (benefiting individual grabbing; for herbivores, deterring carnivores). However, massive size severely reduced narrow natural fitness—rendering them vulnerable to environmental changes. A major environmental shift (e.g., asteroid impact, plant toxicity, climate change) proved catastrophic, eliminating all but small-bodied avian dinosaurs. Thus, while external factors (meteor strikes, etc.) are often cited, the internal cause of extinction is likely reduced narrow natural fitness due to intense intraspecific struggle.

</p>  

I must reiterate: the Group Selection discussed in this book does not necessarily occur between highly cooperative groups, nor does it arise from intergroup conflict. This typical Group Selection model is more prevalent in highly cooperative organisms like humans and ants.

The concept of Group Selection discussed here primarily operates on species with closely related genes—internal grabbing (whether in forms like "genetic grabbing," "intra-group grabbing," or "sexual grabbing") leads to a decline in the fitness of every individual within the entire species. Ultimately, such species may be eliminated or replaced by sister lineages that have developed reproductive isolation (where grabbing genes have not been transmitted) or by other species occupying the same ecological niche. In this way, groups engaged in internal grabbing and subject to reproductive isolation will gradually diminish in the biological world and face eventual elimination—unless they evolve mechanisms to resist grabbing, such as the Imprinting Gene Mechanism or Virtue Selection.  

### The "Constraint-Incompetence" Mechanism—"Doing Nothing Yet Accomplishing Everything"  
Thus far, we have already discussed various "Constraint-Incompetence" mechanisms. For example, as mentioned in this chapter, female mammals are unable to produce male offspring through parthenogenesis; the Imprinting Gene Mechanism prevents both males and females from monopolizing their offspring’s genetic material—they must retain the genes of the other parent. Morality also falls under the category of the "Constraint-Incompetence" Mechanism. Specifically, compassion restrains us from harming conspecifics; integrity prevents us from breaking promises; a sense of shame deters corruption; and loyalty discourages betrayal.  

Laozi’s *Tao Te Ching* contains a profound statement: ["Doing nothing yet accomplishing everything"](). People often interpret this as Non-Action Governance. However, I argue its core lies in guiding humanity back to the innate tendency toward mutual cooperation in primitive societies—a state akin to water, which "benefits all things without contention." This counteracts the escalating grabbing tendencies driven by intensifying competition among individuals and groups. Only by preserving cooperative instincts and avoiding grabbing can the potential of the human life community be fully realized, ultimately achieving the "ability to accomplish all things."  

[Though this chapter focuses on Group Selection, it inherently involves discussions of grabbing and cooperation.]() In fact, one will observe that as life evolves toward greater complexity and sophistication, the expression of genes becomes increasingly constrained. The purpose of these constraints can almost universally be attributed to one goal: preventing grabbing—promoting cooperation—thus reaping the dividends of cooperation. This is a fundamental rule underlying the evolution of all things.  

[Grabbing and cooperation, akin to chaos and order, engage in games across the detailed battlefields of Adversarial Evolution, locking in a struggle that has persisted for billions of years.]() Humanity and its civilization stand as the most remarkable creations of the deities of cooperation and order. Yet, the deities of grabbing and chaos ceaselessly devise schemes to pull humanity and its civilization back into the abyss of chaos. The final outcome remains uncertain.
