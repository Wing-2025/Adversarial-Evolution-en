# Chapter on Group Selection  
In the preceding chapters of this book, the concept of "Group Selection" has already been introduced. By this chapter, we have established a sufficiently mature foundation to delve deeply into this topic. For many years, Group Selection has been a focal point of academic debate. Proponents often attribute altruistic phenomena to Group Selection; opponents argue that Individual Selection already explains all phenomena, rendering the introduction of Group Selection unnecessary and complicating explanatory models. Furthermore, the theory of Group Selection has long been overshadowed by the "Altruism Paradox," as nearly all cases of Group Selection can be refuted by this paradox. Adhering to the principle of tracing origins and probing thoroughly, this chapter will conduct an in-depth analysis of this concept that has perplexed both the public and academia for years. Additionally, this chapter will explore the origins of the two sexes, their deep-seated conflicts and grabbing strategies, propose the phenomenon of unisexual reproductive decline caused by deceptive parthenogenesis, and discuss the evolutionary "purposes" of the XY Chromosome Mechanism and the Imprinting Gene Mechanism. This chapter contains substantial academic content, including some complex theoretical deductions, and is best suited for readers with a certain academic background. General readers may choose to skip most of this chapter without significantly affecting their understanding of subsequent content.  

# Does Group Selection Exist?  
Wynne-Edwards (1906-1997) first proposed the theory of Group Selection in 1962 to explain altruistic behaviors. Group Selection refers to natural selection operating at the level of groups. Here, the target of natural selection is not scattered, unorganized individuals, but rather a group—typically a cooperative group composed of multiple conspecific organisms, such as a pride of lions, a pack of wolves, or a colony of ants.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65c728a7-2ff4-4928-997b-07fe5a5b5336" />  
</p>  

Wynne-Edwards argued that the unit of natural selection is the group, not the individual. To ensure the continuation and growth of the group, individuals often sacrifice their own interests—particularly reproductive desires—to maximize the group’s welfare. Every lion in a pride should contribute to the group’s interests, even restraining its reproductive urges. We have also heard the widely disseminated claim that when wolf populations plummet, female wolves will unhesitatingly increase their reproductive capacity to maintain population levels. These behaviors appear to prioritize group interests.  

Just four years after Wynne-Edwards proposed Group Selection, American biologist George Williams published *Adaptation and Natural Selection* in 1966, comprehensively refuting the theory and, integrating prior genetic research, proposing Gene Selection Theory. When the book was reissued in 1996, its counterarguments against Group Selection were even more forceful. Williams pointed out that when biological phenomena can be explained using principles of physics and natural selection, there is no need to invoke more complex mechanisms. Thus, while biological explanations based on Group Selection may sound appealing, they are fundamentally unnecessary. An apple tree blooms and bears fruit solely for its own reproduction, not for human nutrition or economic benefit. The occasional apple falling on Newton’s head was purely the result of physical principles; the apple itself was indifferent to Newton.  

Academic debate over the existence of Group Selection remains heated. Some scholars argue that Group Selection is real, often citing eusocial organisms like ants and bees as examples. Others contend that Group Selection does not exist, as clear evidence and trends of Group Selection are scarce outside eusocial species. They argue that short-sighted pursuit of immediate interests exerts stronger selective pressure than pursuit of long-term group interests. The Altruism Paradox, mentioned earlier, is a common counterargument against Group Selection.  

On one hand, proponents of Group Selection do have flaws in their reasoning. Examples like ants and bees—where Group Selection is claimed—do involve group-level competition, as intercolony battles often result in heavy casualties, with more cohesive and larger colonies more likely to triumph and occupy territory. However, if we recall the concept of Superorganismalism from earlier, we can explain this phenomenon through competition between superorganisms without invoking Group Selection. Due to the uniqueness of superorganism species, their cooperation and self-sacrifice resemble one part of a biological individual aiding another. The peculiarity of ants and bees cannot be generalized as a universal theory.  

On the other hand, opponents of Group Selection are too hasty in dismissing its significance. While a universally applicable Group Selection mechanism is complex and long eluded clear description, it is not nonexistent. The Altruism Paradox may seem unassailable, but as discussed earlier, under mechanisms such as the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, the Green Beard Model, and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, altruistic behaviors can reach an Evolutionarily Stable State. As repeatedly emphasized, any long-enduring reciprocal altruistic cooperation must be underpinned by a mechanism countering Adversarial Evolution. To discern the truth, we need only examine the mechanisms behind these phenomena.  

In this chapter, we will systematically address these issues and propose theoretical frameworks to explain Group Selection, clarifying its varied forms and core logic. Let us begin with two altruistic phenomena—avian alarm calls and "stotting" in Thomson’s gazelles (Gazella thomsoni)—which are central to the debate.  

## Starting with "Stotting"—Defining and Proving Group Selection  
Thomson’s gazelle (Gazella thomsoni), a small antelope (Antilope) in the genus Gazella, resembles a deer in size. It lives in large, gregarious herds. Each gazelle has short horns. As the second-fastest sprinter on the African savanna, reaching speeds up to 90 km/h, it outpaces most predators. When a Thomson’s gazelle detects a predator, it stots—jumping conspicuously—to alert its peers, exposing itself to the predator. For a long time, this exaggerated, seemingly redundant warning behavior (we need not elaborate on the Handicap Principle here) has defied easy explanation: from any perspective, it benefits the gazelle little. According to the selfish gene theory, its optimal strategy would be to flee silently upon spotting a predator, leaving peers behind to delay the threat.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51fc169a-2b51-4892-9969-9f921a50c6a3" />  
</p>  

Similarly, avian and mammalian species commonly exhibit alarm-calling behavior, where individuals vocalize to warn peers of approaching threats like eagles or snakes. Such behavior offers little benefit to the "selfish gene."  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d22c11-3727-4f3c-8825-c7fe47bc17de" />  
</p>  

Can we explain this using Kin Selection? The answer remains no, as the Altruism Paradox still applies. If even one gazelle lacks the warning gene, it would gain a survival advantage: it would have higher fitness than peers with the warning gene, reproduce more successfully, and gradually eliminate other gazelles. How, then, did this behavior evolve? How does Group Selection occur? We will explain using the evolutionary process of alarm-calling as an example:  

### Principle of Spatiotemporal Locality of Kin Genes—The Secret Behind Alarm-Call Evolution  
Next, we introduce the Principle of Spatiotemporal Locality of Kin Genes. In the four-dimensional space-time continuum, each bird at each moment corresponds to a point in this 4D space. For a bird that alarm-calls, it slightly reduces its own fitness to enhance the fitness of all birds near this point. As shown in the figure below, the X and Y axes represent space, and the Z axis represents time. If the red point is the spatiotemporal position of the alarm-calling individual, green points are the beneficiaries; blue points are non-beneficiaries (in reality, each individual forms a line in 4D space-time, but we simplify this for clarity). A pattern emerges: beneficiaries are spatiotemporally local to the alarm-calling individual—we term this region A. Simultaneously, individuals genetically related to the alarm-caller (kin) are also likely to be near this red point, as kin typically live in proximity. Thus, the distribution of kin genes also exhibits spatiotemporal locality—we term this region B.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43e8275-2c27-4460-959d-fa3845949f26" />  
</p>  

In reality, regions A and B overlap significantly, as both are near the red point. Therefore, the alarm-caller’s kin are likely to be the beneficiaries. From a genetic perspective, the primary beneficiaries of the alarm-calling gene’s sacrifice are the gene itself.

In reality, nearly all phenomena of Group Selection inherently involve the spatial-temporal locality principle of related genes. At the genetic level, this also fully aligns with the principle of the "selfish gene." Therefore, the essence of Group Selection is essentially the "self-selection" of related genes. In extreme cases like ants, it is akin to the "left hand helping the right hand." Consequently, the long-standing academic debate between "Group Selection" and "Individual Selection" is merely two sides of the same coin—they describe the same underlying process. From the perspective of Dimension Ascension, Group Selection becomes much easier to understand, and this will serve as the book's definition of "Group Selection": [Group Selection is a product of the intermediate state of Dimension Ascension; its ultimate form is essentially Individual Selection at a higher dimension.]() It is crucial to emphasize again: Group Selection is nothing more than Individual Selection at a higher dimension! For example, a human individual, as a multicellular organism, can be seen as a collection of countless cells and a vast community of microorganisms within the body. Once the human body dies, nearly all these cells and microorganisms will perish sequentially. Thus, the process of natural selection acting on this group of cells and microorganisms can be simplified as the process of selection acting on the human individual. Furthermore, in more complex models of Group Selection, kin selection significantly enhances group cohesion—manifested in phenomena like family identity, ethnic identity, and even racial discrimination (a sensitive topic that, while worthy of extensive exploration, will not be elaborated upon in this book). We can equate kin selection to a factor that shortens the distance between individuals. Ultimately, this can also be explained through the spatial-temporal locality model of related genes. With this, the basic definition and theoretical proof of Group Selection are complete. While "Individual Selection" can explain all phenomena—much like an apple falling does not exist to inspire Newton—it is only when we grasp the theoretical tool of gravity that we gain the foundation for interstellar travel and cosmic exploration, a possibility unimaginable to the apple itself. Similarly, "Group Selection" provides the basis for subsequent analyses of the Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model and for uncovering the roots of human origins and the various challenges we face. Explaining this principle through logical reasoning is somewhat convoluted, so I simulated this mathematical model using program code, and the results corroborate the above theory.  

### Mathematical Model && Code Simulation  
First, we establish the following mathematical model:  
1. Initially, 2000 (Creature_Population) Thomson's gazelles are randomly placed on the map, with 1% of them possessing the alarm-calling gene (triggering a conspicuous leap upon detecting a predator).  
2. These gazelles move randomly each day, covering an average distance of 1 km.  
3. Each day, 8 random locations on the map experience a hunting event. During a hunt, gazelles within a 3.5 km (Catch_radius) radius face life-threatening danger. Each gazelle in the area has a 20% (Catch_Not_Awake_Rate) chance of being killed. Additionally, each gazelle has a 20% (Awake_Rate) chance to detect the predator before the hunt begins—a state referred to as "awake." When a gazelle is awake, its chance of being killed drops to 2% (Catch_Awake_Rate).  
4. Within the hunting radius, if an alarm-calling gazelle detects the predator (enters the awake state, also with a 20% chance), it will emit an alarm call. This behavior causes all gazelles in the hunting radius to enter the awake state, reducing their kill probability to 3%.  
5. Each day, the number of deceased gazelles is tallied, and the population is replenished through reproduction. Reproduction follows a probability-based selection of parent gazelles according to their fitness (roulette wheel selection algorithm). We assume non-alarm-calling selfish gazelles have a fitness of 1 (Not_Alarm_Fitness), while alarm-calling gazelles have a reduced fitness of 0.95 (Alarm_Fitness). Thus, non-alarm-calling gazelles are more likely to reproduce. Offspring are born at the same location as their parents.  

> Explanation: The design of this mathematical model includes several key points:  
- The alarm-calling behavior provides no direct benefit to the individual gazelle, as it must first enter the awake state to call, and its kill probability remains unchanged regardless of whether it calls.  
- Alarm-calling gazelles have lower fitness than non-alarm-calling ones, making alarm-calling a purely altruistic behavior that sacrifices some fitness (previous theories posited such behaviors would be eliminated by free-riders).  

According to the program simulation of the above model, after 400 generations, the proportion of alarm-calling gazelles increased from the initial 1% to approximately 6%, fluctuating around this number (red dots represent alarm-calling gazelles; black dots represent non-alarm-calling ones).

### Characteristics of the Spatial-Temporal Locality Principle  
First, [Group Selection is stochastic; it operates probabilistically and statistically rather than absolutely, and individual members do not require explicit group affiliation. This form of Group Selection is termed "weak group selection" in this book.]() Second, [its core condition is the spatial-temporal locality (spatial-temporal clustering) of related genes.]() Third, the fitness sacrifice incurred by altruistic behavior is minimal, reducing the likelihood of immediate elimination by natural selection—such altruistic individuals still have ample opportunities to reproduce. Moreover, the ratio of the group fitness gain to the individual fitness loss is highly favorable. Only in this way can the benefits of such behavior propagate back to the individual through related genes, ultimately offsetting the fitness reduction. [Its essence remains the intrinsic evolutionary drive of "selfish" genes to collaborate and gain cooperative dividends.]() Group Selection and the selfish gene theory are two sides of the same coin, with no fundamental contradiction. However, to grasp this, one must first understand the sophisticated strategies of selfish genes. [With the aid of the spatial-temporal locality principle of related genes, we can explain numerous instances of limited yet impactful intra-species altruism. This principle also serves as a transitional stage for more advanced altruistic mechanisms,] such as the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mentioned earlier.  

## Common Group Selection Mechanisms  
Beyond the weak group selection mechanism based on spatial-temporal locality, nature broadly encompasses the following Group Selection mechanisms: kin selection combined with the Tit-for-Tat strategy, Superorganismalism, and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. We will elaborate on these below.  

### Kin Selection and the Tit-for-Tat Strategy  
For more advanced animals, the formation of groups is even more pronounced. Many mammals, such as lions, wolves, and orcas, exhibit regular group behavior, with primates being the most prominent example. Here, kin selection forms the foundation, combined with the Tit-for-Tat strategy to ensure that altruism and cooperation do not impose excessive costs on individuals while curbing the proliferation of Free-Riderism.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bae95d8-9511-4eb5-beb0-6b840c43314c" /></p>  

Many predatory mammalian groups, such as lion prides and African wild dogs in the desert, establish matrilineal dynasties based on this foundation, displaying high levels of cooperation. Different groups frequently engage in territorial disputes. Defeated groups are forced to abandon prime hunting grounds, experiencing selective pressure at the group level.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132aca2b-8e80-46cb-a548-3f276f2eb6e9" /></p>  

### Group Selection through Superorganismalism  
For species like ants that adopt a Superorganismal strategy, most individuals have their reproductive capacity suppressed. The propagation of their genes relies solely on the single "reproductive organ" (the queen). Cooperation among these individuals is akin to the left hand helping the right hand in a human body; the entire group can be viewed as a single "superorganism," with each original individual functioning as a cell within this superorganism. Thus, the logic of Group Selection for these species is nearly identical to the principle of natural selection acting on individuals. Given the clear group affiliation of each individual, this form of Group Selection is termed "strong group selection" in this book.  

The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren), an invasive species in China originally from South America, has earned the moniker "invincible ant" due to its venomous stinger. As a carnivorous ant, it preys on small insects and other ant species, such as Santschi's flat-headed ant. Owing to overlapping habitats and the smaller size of Santschi's flat-headed ants, they become targets for resource competition and predation by fire ants. Despite the fire ant's larger size and venom, Santschi's flat-headed ant (known as the "exploding ant") employs a "last resort": when losing a battle, it contracts its abdomen violently, causing its body to explode and releasing highly corrosive formic acid, which also harms fire ants.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b83449-dc0a-4098-abe8-b50d2e4eb4c3" /></p>

Ants exhibit a strong sense of territoriality and camaraderie, with conflicts between different ant colonies often erupting over territory or food. These inter-colony confrontations constitute intense instances of Group Selection.  

### The Unique Humanity: Group Selection Shaped by Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism (Good for Virtue and Bad for Evil) has fostered the most tightly-knit systems of social cooperation and division of labor in human history. This philosophy has not only revolutionized the intensity of intra-specific cooperation but also dramatically heightened the intensity of Group Selection. Prior to humanity, Group Selection was generally a weak process—an undercurrent in evolution (excluding Hymenoptera). However, once Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism united human groups unprecedentedly, competitions between human groups and other biological entities (such as large mammals), as well as conflicts between human groups themselves, including wars, became frequent occurrences. In these processes, the group that excelled in agricultural technology (supporting a larger population), advanced weaponry, unity, high Group Cooperation Degree, individual sacrifice, and fewer hypocrites would emerge victorious. Defeated groups faced dire consequences: some perished in battle, others were enslaved, and still others fled to barren, harsh, or dangerous regions with reduced living standards, resulting in a significant decline in their inclusive fitness.  

Even within human societies, the most intense acts of war represent probabilistic Group Selection. For example, in ancient slave societies, while annihilation of defeated tribes was not unheard of, defeat typically led to enslavement. Regimes like Rome, which treated defeated peoples with leniency and granted them citizenship, were rare. Yet even Rome resorted to brutal massacres when confronting untrustworthy adversaries like Carthage. Enslaved populations, though spared death, had vastly lower inclusive fitness compared to their conquerors. Victorious nobles and citizens reaped substantial rewards, enjoying higher living standards and greater reproductive rights than slaves.

<p align="center">Ruins of Ancient Carthage</p>  

Numerous records indicate that prehistoric humans engaged in innumerable tribal wars, and even after the advent of recorded history, conflicts between states and city-states persisted. These wars operated on a group basis: success or failure affected the entire group. Such contests pitted both "hard power"—population size and physical strength—against "soft power": the Group Cooperation Degree, the willingness of individuals to sacrifice for collective victory, and valiance in battle. The probability of victory favored the more cohesive group. These periods were marked by intense Group Selection, where triumph brought dominance and defeat led to subjugation. Humanity, in essence, was forged through such fierce inter-group competition.  

As noted in the previous chapter, for super-groups (higher-level aggregates of multiple groups), Group Selection probabilistically eliminates intractable internal issues like Hypocrisyism. However, this process often exacts a heavy toll: it is brutal, causes collateral damage, and leaves few unscathed. Ironically, small numbers of individuals who betray their groups may fare relatively better, a tragic paradox.  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b999aa1-533a-4feb-9320-0a69b06c3036" /></p>  

## How Does Group Selection Occur? The Specific Forms of Inter-Group Competition  
To fully grasp Group Selection, understanding the "forms" of inter-group competition is critical. These forms are largely probabilistic and do not require explicit "factional labels." Group Selection does not necessarily involve direct confrontation; it often manifests as competition for resources between groups occupying the same ecological niche or "virtual groups" composed of closely related genes. For instance, a more cooperative group may hunt more efficiently, suffer fewer casualties, and grow in population, thereby squeezing the survival space of other groups with similar dietary habits and outcompeting them for resources. The extinction of Neanderthals by modern Homo sapiens likely stems from such dynamics, as Neanderthals were less competitive within the same ecological niche.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b62e8f-d57d-4624-81f7-d3cacd46b32f" /></p>  
<p align="center">Neanderthals</p>  

Thus, all-out war between groups is neither the sole nor the primary form of Group Selection. In summary, while Group Selection plays a limited role in most species, this is a matter of degree: mild Group Selection is nearly universal, arising from the cooperative tendencies of selfish, closely related genes. Intense Group Selection, however, is more common in species undergoing or nearing Dimension Ascension. As previously stated, Group Selection is essentially Individual Selection at a higher dimension! The processes of Adversarial Evolution between individuals, between individuals and groups, and between groups themselves unfold simultaneously, forming an intricate web—this will be the focus of the next chapter.
