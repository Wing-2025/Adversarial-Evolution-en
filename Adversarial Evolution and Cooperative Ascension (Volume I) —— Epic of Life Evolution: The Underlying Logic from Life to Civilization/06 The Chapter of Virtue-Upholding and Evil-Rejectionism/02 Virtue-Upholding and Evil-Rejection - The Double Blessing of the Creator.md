# Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—The Dual Blessing of the Creator

## The Great "Innovation" of Selfish Genes—The Gene Strategy Selection Model【★★】

Earlier, we discussed kin selection, the Tit-for-Tat mechanism, and the Green Beard model. Through our analysis of these models, we observed glimmers of altruism, yet they still pale in comparison to the degree of altruism exhibited by humans. What, then, is the human gene strategy? Why is it so rare in the biological world? We now turn to "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism"—a gene strategy unparalleled in the biological realm.

### What Is "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism"?

Let us first clarify "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" (hào shàn jí è zhǔ yì). Its phenotypic expressions encompass two dimensions: a predilection for virtue and an aversion to evil. Rewarding virtue and punishing vice constitutes its behavioral code. I deliberated extensively on the naming of this gene strategy, considering alternatives such as "Policing Evil and Punishing Vice" (which felt overly specific) and "Rewarding Virtue and Punishing Vice" (which seemed overly demanding, as not everyone possesses the capacity or authority to mete out rewards or punishments). Additionally, "rewarding" and "punishing" carry connotations of rationality, failing to emphasize the intuitive, instinctual nature of this behavior. Later, I found "hào shàn wù è" (loving virtue and loathing evil) more apt. Initially, I thought this term was my own coinage, only to discover it appears in *The Legend of Yue Fei* with the original phrasing—"Loving virtue and loathing evil is universal among all." I later adjusted it to "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" for easier pronunciation and comprehension, occasionally using terms like "Loving Virtue and Loathing Evil" or "Admiring Virtue and Detesting Evil," all of which refer to this gene strategy within the context of this book.

The term "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" effectively captures the essence of this gene strategy. Affection and aversion are innate, instinctual inclinations, though culture can influence and modify these proclivities to some extent. Culture itself exhibits genetic-like inheritance and dissemination, a phenomenon termed "memes" in *The Selfish Gene*. For simplification, the gene strategies discussed here encompass the dual influences of genes and memes. The core traits of this strategy are: a fondness for virtuous individuals and deeds, and a hatred for evil individuals and deeds. A person’s affections and aversions drive their actions. When encountering a virtuous individual, a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist may express admiration through public opinion, engage in close cooperation, offer support, voice solidarity, cast votes, or advocate on their behalf—indirectly enhancing the virtuous individual’s inclusive fitness. Conversely, when encountering an evil individual, they may sanction them through public opinion or actions, such as non-cooperation, severance of relations, or assigning opprobrium—thereby reducing the evil individual’s inclusive fitness. When endowed with capacity or public authority, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists may elevate these emotional inclinations to the level of systematic reward and punishment: they may enhance the inclusive fitness of "virtuous" individuals through provision, financial support, donations, assistance, protection, or care for their offspring; they may reduce the inclusive fitness of "evil" individuals through complaints, reports, or legal sanctions. The invention and enforcement of law represent a landmark in the punishment of evil.

To further elaborate, what are the manifestations of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism? People extol love, celebrate self-sacrifice, venerate heroes, and support virtuous individuals. Most instinctively condemn theft, robbery, murder, rape, and promiscuity; they also instinctively resent freeloaders, opportunists, tyrants, exploiters, greed-mongers, ungrateful betrayers, murderers for profit, double-dealers, hypocrites, smiling deceivers, faith-breakers, and turncoats. These reactions arise even when such incidents involve unrelated third parties—a uniquely human mechanism of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. This behavior is nearly absent in other organisms yet so pervasive in human society that some remain oblivious to its uniqueness. In humanity’s early stages, tales of chivalrous vice-punishment and amorous partnerships were likely the most celebrated. Supported by the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism, good deeds are rewarded and evil deeds punished—a phenomenon unseen in other biological societies. It is precisely this mechanism that has enabled human society to exceptionally evolve and preserve the instinct for mutual altruism.

</p>

The sole limitation of the term "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" stems from the conventional, even rigid, public understanding of "Virtue and Evil." Thus, when using this term, we must remind ourselves [the "Virtue and Evil" here are not traditional concepts](). They are defined through rigorous theoretical derivation, which will be elaborated in subsequent chapters.

### The Gene Strategy Selection Model—The "Selfish" "Gene Strategy"

In the previous chapter, I posited a conclusion: any long-enduring altruistic cooperation mechanism must be safeguarded by a mechanism countering grabbing-oriented evolution. We now examine how this mechanism operates in humans—a species sometimes excessively benevolent. Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism represents a great innovation of the selfish gene mechanism: the gene strategy selection model.

What is the gene strategy selection model? In brief, it refers to individuals with this gene "selecting" others who share the same gene strategy, thereby enhancing their fitness through assistance. This gene strategy resembles the self-selection mechanism of the Green Beard model but advances further by extending beyond genetic similarity to "gene strategy" alignment. It prioritizes abstract strategic consistency over specific genetic phenotypes or coding. The Green Beard model focuses on distinguishing "self" from "non-self"; [the gene strategy selection model focuses on "resemblance to self" in strategy](). Consequently, the gene strategy selection model spreads more readily than the Green Beard model.

<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/859ea577-88aa-4f15-b8a1-019a00c49f8d" />
</p>
<p align="center">Decision Tree Model of Gene Strategy Selection</p>

The selfishness and partiality of strategy-selecting genes lie in strategic form rather than genetic coding. Thus, these genes can evolve continuously, even treating heterologous genes equitably—transcending narrow kin selection. Yet, regardless of changes, the strategic form they pursue endures. Here, selfishness is not embodied in the entire gene or gene segments but in the behavioral strategy expressed by the gene. Among all selfish forms of selfish genes, this strategy sacrifices the most but ultimately gains the most—a masterful balance of give-and-take.

Theoretically, there are infinite modes of gene strategy selection: selecting genes that execute "grabbing" strategies, "cooperative" strategies, or even "grabbing on odd days and cooperating on even days" strategies. Why, then, has the "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" strategy selection gene achieved the widest success? This question will be addressed in the next subsection.

From the perspective of maintaining gene strategy, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism may be the most "selfish" gene ever. It transcends individuals, families, and races to form alliances, uniting to exclude non-"virtuous" individuals—even those with high kinship. This ensures that all individuals within the group are virtuous (i.e., aligned with its gene strategy). It has forged the most ingenious selfish gene mechanism in history.

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10ed163-2a8d-4353-a312-7512af154afb" />
</p>

[The result, however, is that we witness the most inconceivable altruistic phenomenon ever seen in the biological world.]() In the biological realm, even the slightest unconditional altruistic tendency, let alone self-sacrifice for others, is typically eroded by the "Altruism Paradox" over large evolutionary timescales. Yet, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals will go to great lengths for the survival of their peers and dedicate themselves to the welfare of their group. Though this altruism is genetically selfish (excluding other gene strategies), it does not diminish the sincerity and purity of the individual’s altruistic motivation and instinct. [Thus, the selfishness of genes and the selfishness of biological individuals are not directly related; in fact, far-sighted selfish genes can "invent" thorough altruistic mechanisms like "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism."]()

### The Optimal Solution of the Gene Strategy Selection Model

What defines "Virtue" and "Evil" in Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism? The public generally perceives "virtue" as selfless, even self-sacrificing, behavior without regard for recompense. I do not contest this sociological definition. [I must repeatedly emphasize that the term "virtue" used here does not refer to its sociological meaning. I have borrowed the term "virtue" for ease of exposition and reader comprehension, as it approximates the concept I describe.]() The undiscriminating altruism and lack of vice-punishment mentioned earlier will be termed "Nice Guy"ism in this text.

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ff63e80-13b1-47c9-8255-c738d7cb16b6" />
</p>  
Here, I do not aim to explore the sociological standards of Virtue and Evil, which are highly complex and vary across cultures. Instead, I seek to define "virtue" as a phenotypic trait of genes with greater precision. If we conceptualize evolution as an algorithm and the standards of Virtue and Evil as the solution to maximizing the interests of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist" groups, theoretically, we can derive an optimal standard for Virtue and Evil. Through this process, we can also address the earlier question—why has the "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" genetic strategy model ultimately achieved the most widespread success, rather than other models?  

Among genetic strategies capable of selection, which are most likely to survive and thrive under the broad sense of natural selection? Given our prior discussion of the Law of Grabbing Deficit and the Law of Cooperative Dividend, we may infer that genes adopting the strategy of "selecting mutually cooperative individuals and eliminating grabbing individuals" will ultimately triumph.  

First, we can posit that the outcome of genetic strategy selection must converge all genetic strategies within a population to align with itself. If the remaining genes are purely Grabbingist, the Grabbing Deficit will erode the fitness of every individual in the group. Conversely, if the outcome of selection favors mutually cooperative genes, the fitness of every individual in the group will be significantly enhanced. Through reverse deduction, we thus conclude that genes selecting mutually cooperative strategies will ultimately prevail.  

Second, we must note that the genetic strategy selection mechanism itself is "recursive" and interlinked. Therefore, the selected genetic strategy must also be a "strategy" within the same genetic selection model—that is, selected individuals must also "select" other individuals adhering to the same strategy. Specifically, for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist genes, they must satisfy the condition of "virtuous individuals upholding virtue." Since they select mutually cooperative genetic strategies, it is imperative for them to actively eliminate grabbing individuals that threaten mutually cooperative genes. Thus, the genetic strategy selection mechanism will at least prioritize genes that adopt the strategy of "mutual cooperation and suppression of Grabbingism."  

While we have discussed that groups practicing reciprocal altruism and maximizing Cooperative Dividend are optimal, this is not the full picture. A group where individuals practice reciprocal altruism while maintaining high creativity and fitness—where each individual’s creative capacity (constructive ability) is robust—will outperform a group practicing mere reciprocal altruism. If individuals with stronger creative capacities fully leverage cooperative potential, the upper limit of Cooperative Dividend for their group will be correspondingly higher. As previously noted, benign competition (Non-grabbing Competition) is a critical driver of individual fitness improvement.  

[Integrating all these factors, the genetic strategy selection mechanism will ultimately favor individuals with genetic strategies characterized by "strong creative capacity, mutual altruism, and hatred toward grabbing individuals." For groups composed of such individuals will be the most robust.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad6bd85e-872c-45a3-8ff4-909f902db241" /></p>  
<p align="center">Decision Tree Model of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism Strategy</p>  

This purely theoretical reasoning regarding the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism may be intellectually demanding, but it suffices for now to grasp the concept. We will revisit this gene-based form from multiple angles later, and with concrete examples, its essence will become clearer. Additionally, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism aligns with academic theories of "reputation-based indirect reciprocity that involves punishment," though I use the term "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" here, as it is, in my view, more comprehensive and vivid.  

### The Adversarial Evolutionary Definition of "Virtue"—A Beautiful Melody in Recursion  
To summarize, based on the reasoning above, "virtue" within the framework of Adversarial Evolution encompasses at least the following dimensions: upholding virtue, mutually cooperating with other virtuous individuals, assisting other virtuous individuals, vehemently opposing evil, and pursuing stronger creative capacity. Notably, "virtue" here is a recursive concept—"virtuous individuals must uphold virtue." Upholding virtue means protecting and assisting those who "mutually cooperate, assist other virtuous individuals, vehemently oppose evil, and possess stronger creative capacity."  

[Moreover, upholding virtue necessarily includes a virtuous individual’s love for and responsibility toward themselves, as they are also "virtuous"—virtuous individuals do not readily sacrifice or self-deny, for their own inheritance and influence are critical to the long-term interests of the group.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8d4a17-2cc5-485c-9672-a7114624cc44" />
</p>  

Only in this way can Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist groups become the most fit in competition with all other genetic strategy groups, successfully entering an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) state. Significantly, the genetic strategy selection mechanism has transformed individual competition into group competition, making it difficult for other species still competing at the individual level to rival groups formed by this selection model—for they are cooperative groups capable of "dimensionality reduction attacks" against non-cooperative individuals.  

The key challenge in understanding lies in recognizing that "virtue" is a recursive concept: only those who "uphold virtue and reject evil" can be called "virtuous." The definition of "Virtue and Evil" derived from the optimal solution of Adversarial Evolution does not align with conventional moral concepts. This must be emphasized repeatedly: [The "Virtue and Evil" discussed in this book specifically refers to the Adversarial Evolutionary definition, not traditional moral concepts!]()  

The primary distinction between traditional "virtue" and Adversarial Evolutionary "virtue" is that the former emphasizes blind, undiscriminating altruism, while the latter emphasizes discriminate altruism—even punishing grabbing individuals. Confucius once addressed this: "‘If you repay enmity with virtue, with what will you repay virtue?’" Why did this divergence emerge? It is, unfortunately, the result of moral distortions, a topic we will explore in Volume II.  

## What Are Virtue and Evil? Is Altruism Virtue and Selfishness Evil?【★★】  
What is the significance of the Adversarial Evolutionary definition of Virtue and Evil? A precise definition is critical. Historically, people have conflated "altruism" with "virtue" and "selfishness" with "evil," often using altruism as the standard for virtue and selfishness as the marker of evil. This is a grave misunderstanding stemming from moral instincts, religious doctrines, and distortions of Confucianism and Buddhism. In reality, only by deeply and precisely understanding the definition of Virtue and Evil can we accurately identify, judge, and prevent PUA (manipulation) and moral coercion.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd448a8-0cd4-4641-9725-1d233fd66def" />
</p>  

First, let us offer a simplified definition of virtue: [Virtue is behavior that maximizes the long-term interests of high-dimensional life forms, i.e., the "selfish" behavior of high-dimensional life forms.]() To clarify: Virtue is behavior that maximizes the long-term interests of a group. Does altruism necessarily equate to virtue? Is selfishness necessarily evil? Not necessarily. The criterion for judging whether altruism is virtuous lies in whether the act increases the group’s long-term interests. Similarly, selfishness is evil only if it undermines the group’s long-term interests.  

For example, if your assistance to someone incurs a cost less than their gain, the group’s overall interests increase—this altruism is virtuous. Conversely, if your assistance costs more than the recipient gains, the group’s interests decline—this altruism is not virtuous; if the disparity is extreme, it may even be evil. In such cases, "selfishness" (withholding assistance) is preferable. Translating this into our earlier theory: if an action generates Cooperative Dividend, it is virtuous; if cooperation leads to deficit, it is not virtuous—such "cooperation" is essentially Grabbing Deficit.  

#### Altruism Is Not Necessarily Virtue; Selfishness Is Not Necessarily Evil  
Moreover, the term "long-term" is critical. To discern long-term trends, we must analyze from an evolutionary perspective. Without considering the "long-term," we risk falling into the trap of "collectivism." Suppose you assist an evil individual: while the group’s immediate interests may increase (even generating Cooperative Dividend), this altruism may still be evil. From an evolutionary standpoint, evil individuals harm the group’s long-term interests; assisting them enhances their reproductive success, thereby exacerbating harm to the group. Such altruism is not virtuous.  

Another example: if you are a highly virtuous individual (upholding virtue, rejecting evil, and possessing strong personal abilities), sacrificing yourself for the group at a critical juncture—neglecting your own well-being and failing to protect your genetic transmission—may be evil. For the genetic inheritance of virtuous individuals is vital to the group; their sacrifice for trivial gains is unwarranted. This illustrates the importance of evolutionary analysis. While sacrificing a few for group interests may seem expedient in the short term, given the scarcity and significance of virtuous genes, the group should never sacrifice them for minor benefits.  

[This underscores the importance of analyzing issues from an evolutionary perspective.]()

Suppose one day you face such a dilemma: you can sacrifice yourself to save another person’s life. Choosing to sacrifice yourself would likely be an act of evil. Why does self-sacrifice for others become an evil act? On the one hand, you may not know whether the other person is virtuous or evil. On the other hand, if your instinct compels you to sacrifice yourself for another, it indicates you possess a precious spirit of self-sacrifice and a high potential for virtue—your level of virtue is likely greater than that of the other person. Sacrificing yourself to save someone with a relatively lower level of virtue would, from the perspective of evolutionary trends, harm the interests of the group. You should instead leverage this potential to create greater benefits for the group, such as sacrificing only when your death could save ten virtuous individuals or one individual who is both virtuous and exceptionally capable. The transmission of your genes is critical. From an evolutionary standpoint, ensuring your genetic legacy spreads and your virtuous potential is activated at optimal times represents the choice that maximizes group interests. We must remain vigilant against the performative acts of hypocrites and moral coercion, while also recognizing the necessity of appropriate selfishness to protect ourselves. Indeed, we should even "selfishly" prioritize the propagation of our "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" genes, as this holds profound significance for the group’s evolution. [This reveals a fascinating and profound logic: certain forms of selfishness can promote the long-term interests of the group, while certain acts of altruism may harm them. Similarly, certain forms of grabbing may benefit the group’s long-term interests, and certain acts of leniency or inaction may harm them.]()<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/019fc2a4-a2ca-4c75-bd93-bc85c11ee94d" /></p>  

Additionally, in the section *Ant Theocracy vs. Human Philosophy*, we will discuss how humanity’s remarkable progress stems from preserving genetic diversity, individual reproductive rights, and competitive mechanisms—factors that can ultimately be attributed to human selfishness. Therefore, reasonably maintaining selfishness, protecting one’s virtuous genes, and sustaining fair competition to maximize personal capabilities, realize individual value, and propagate kind and excellent genes represent another key factor in human success, alongside "collectivism." The reasonable selfishness of the virtuous is a great act of virtue for oneself, others, and the human life community.  

The evolutionary root of individual selfishness lies in the selfishness of genes. Some "foresighted" selfish genes first forge temporal connections between individuals—for example, anxiety about the future, hope for tomorrow, and love for future generations are mechanisms by which genes construct temporally integrated individuals. Even as an individual’s physical composition constantly renews, this connection endures. More "foresighted" selfish genes further shape spatial connections among individuals with shared genes—such as empathy and love between different individuals. This ultimately forms a mutually beneficial whole that transcends time and space, which can also be termed a "selfish" superorganism. Individual selfishness thus constitutes a critical component of genetic selfishness. If one cannot even care for oneself or strive for one’s own future, how can one muster the strength to care for one’s kin, nation, or world? Such selfishness indeed benefits the long-term interests of the human group. Hence, [Altruism is not necessarily virtuous; selfishness is not necessarily evil.]()<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21d2f41-a408-4272-a7bf-e2b8cccd53fd" /></p>  

### Excessive Selfishness Is Mostly Evil  

Some forms of selfishness are excessive. For example, individuals who refuse to offer easy help that would provide significant cooperative dividends (e.g.,雪中送炭) to others; or those who safeguard their own life and property at the expense of others’; or those who disrupt market order and fuel involution for short-term personal success—these all qualify as excessive selfishness. Excessively selfish behavior is almost certainly evil; only the selfishness of the virtuous can potentially be virtuous. This conclusion can be inferred from the principles of Adversarial Evolution. Excessively selfish individuals prioritize only their own interests, neglecting others and the group for short-term gains. They neither uphold virtue nor reject evil. Thus, excessive selfishness itself is evil, and the selfishness of the evil merely perpetuates evil. Selfish evil is also deeply dangerous.  

Take Liu Xin (later renamed Liu Nuanxi) in the Jiang Ge case. To conceal the illegality of her apartment and avoid reporting to the police, to protect her own safety by using others as a "boyfriend shield," and knowing that Chen Shifeng harbored murderous intent, she shifted risks onto Jiang Ge. Ultimately, she locked her rescuer, Jiang Ge, outside, even pushing her into danger, leading to Jiang Ge’s death from 11 stab wounds. Afterward, Liu claimed no responsibility. <p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc74964-73ee-4d4f-8365-1efbabb12805" /></p>  

From an evolutionary perspective, Liu’s actions resulted in the loss of a virtuous individual. While we cannot claim Jiang Ge was exceptionally self-sacrificing, she at least demonstrated courage in standing up for her companion, sharing risks, and solving problems. What remained was a self-serving individual devoid of remorse, empathy, guilt, or responsibility—let alone the capacity for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Thus, Liu’s actions, evolutionarily, caused the group to lose a virtuous member and retain one who used a friend as a shield. The more Liu denied responsibility, the more her lack of accountability compounded the group’s loss. Immediately after the incident, Liu prioritized consulting about her legal liability over saving her friend. Such high-level hypocrites often operate within legal boundaries, fitting their evil acts to legal forms to avoid punishment—a root cause of evolutionary crises. Only by transcending emotional notions of virtue and evil, understanding their underlying principles, can we discern right from wrong, ensure our virtuous intentions yield maximal value, identify moral coercion and PUA, and avoid unconsciously perpetuating such behaviors ourselves.  

## The ESS Stability of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism Strategy (Optional Reading)  

We now need to demonstrate whether the genetic strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism can achieve Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) status. As is known, the long-standing argument against the evolution of altruism is that altruistic genes cannot reach ESS—a challenge known as the Altruism Paradox. Explaining how the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism resolves this paradox is key to proving its ESS stability.  

This strategy combines altruism and exclusivity. Its altruism manifests as selfless aid to virtuous individuals; its exclusivity as suppressing evil individuals even at the cost of reduced personal fitness. Individually, neither altruism nor exclusivity is ESS-stable; such behaviors would likely reduce fitness and be eliminated within generations. Remarkably, when combined, these strategies achieve ESS stability. Altruism enhances group cooperation, generating significant cooperative dividends; exclusivity leverages group power to eliminate non-cooperative or grabbing individuals (as groups easily marginalize individuals).  

When Grabbingism, Free-Riderism, Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, or even pure altruistic "Good Samaritanism" are introduced into a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism group, the fitness of individuals adhering to these alternative strategies is lower than that of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism individuals. This is because Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism individuals are less altruistic and cooperative toward non-strategy adherents. For grabbing genes, punishment further reduces their fitness, ultimately making Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism the highest-fitness strategy (a critical condition). Simulations confirm this evolutionary trajectory, showing Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism individuals securing stable advantages. <p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1836ea25-9240-42a4-b0e3-52e1bd2d81de" /></p>  

Thus, a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism group remains in ESS stability until more complex genetic strategies emerge. Even if alternative strategies exist, as analyzed earlier, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism will ultimately prevail. Additionally, per ESS requirements, the definition of "virtue" must evolve with the environment—for example, adapting to detect Hypocrisyism. Here, the priority of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism’s altruism is crucial. Without prioritization, Good Samaritanism would gradually eliminate Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, which would then be replaced by Grabbingism. Thus, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism prioritizes aiding fellow strategy adherents over Good Samaritans, ensuring its ESS stability.

The degrees of altruism (red) and punishment (blue) directed by virtue-upholding and evil-rejecting individuals toward different targets are shown in the following figures:  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0076cf05-bdd8-48af-97d2-277ec50d806a" /></p>  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/160b516f-8338-41e8-9f6c-b3f7fc56f5fc" /></p>  

From this, we can clearly deduce that indiscriminate altruism—namely, "do-gooderism"—is not strictly "virtue" in the defined sense. Unconditional altruism cannot enter an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) state. Only when paired with virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism can an ESS state be achieved. Even acts of rewarding virtue should vary in degree and priority; this behavioral pattern better maintains the stability of the virtue-upholding and evil-rejection mechanism. While unconditional altruism does enhance immediate cooperative dividends, from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, its long-term significance pales in comparison to *discriminating* altruism—a model that combines both rewarding virtue and punishing evil. As we will later discover, virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism is nearly the only stable solution under the Adversarial Evolution model, and possibly the sole mode to resist cosmic entropy increase.  

## Virtue Selection—Defying "Natural" Evolution [★★]  
[The instinct of virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism has realized a mechanism of "virtuous individuals selecting virtuous individuals" beyond "narrow natural selection"—herein referred to as "Virtue Selection," or "Virtue Choices" for short.]()  

Virtue Selection involves granting greater assistance to virtuous individuals to enhance their fitness, while punishing evil individuals to reduce theirs. Through this interplay, humanity can transcend the evolutionary pressures of nature’s fundamental laws, reverse the tendentious drift toward grabbingism, and achieve unexpected success. For readers familiar with optimization or deep learning algorithms, understanding Virtue Selection through this lens may clarify its role. Essentially, Virtue Selection functions as a loss function supplementary to natural selection. This loss function, working alongside the original narrow natural selection loss function, influences the iterative direction of the "model." It fundamentally alters humanity’s broad fitness evaluation, thereby shaping our evolutionary trajectory.  

Does Virtue Selection have no analogues in the animal kingdom? In fact, rudimentary forms exist in many social animals, such as the social weaver bird. The social weaver (scientific name: *Philetairus socius*), a monotypic species resembling a sparrow, inhabits north-central Namibia, extending south to southwestern Botswana and northwestern South Africa. During the breeding season, these African weavers construct massive, compound communal nests using grass stems, leaves, and willow fibers—an architectural marvel rare among birds. Each breeding pair occupies its own "apartment" within this structure, competing to build the most elaborate unit.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2cad5b2-30f8-40ce-bbe0-d0ca46cfd1bc" /></p>  
<p align="center">Social Weaver Nests</p>  

Social weavers build permanent nests on trees and other elevated structures—among the largest bird nests in existence—comprising segregated chambers for each breeding pair (and sometimes their offspring). A single nest can accommodate over 100 pairs across multiple generations, imbuing otherwise lifeless telephone poles with vibrant structure. These nests are functionally designed: the inner chambers retain heat for nighttime roosting, while outer chambers provide daytime shade, maintaining internal temperatures between 7–8°C even as external temperatures soar to 16–33°C (exemplifying the mechanism behind the Law of Cooperative Dividend).  

However, social weavers face the "free-rider problem" common in biology (a form of the Altruism Paradox). Lazy individuals that shirk nest-building conserve energy and gain greater reproductive opportunities, risking the spread of "slacker genes." To counter this, social weavers have evolved a mechanism (a necessary safeguard for all altruistic behaviors): specialized "patrol groups" track slackers, and caught slackers are fiercely pecked. This drastically reduces their fitness—injuries may lead to death or impaired reproduction, making diligent work the more advantageous strategy. It is through this Virtue Selection mechanism that social weavers sustain their cooperative behavior. As a genetic strategy selection mechanism, Virtue Selection forms the foundational basis for humanity’s greater release of cooperative dividends. [Theoretically, it demonstrates the existence of an altruistic model not purely dependent on Group Selection, and this model can enter an ESS.]()  

Darwin, though not fully understanding this mechanism, recognized its importance. As mentioned in Chapter 1, [he wrote presciently in *The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex*: "The high importance of the love of approbation and the dread of infamy cannot be overrated."]()  

### Altruistic Models of "Selfish Genes"  
Notably, the virtue-upholding and evil-rejection mechanism does not transcend the "selfish gene" framework; instead, it reveals an exceptionally sophisticated genetic strategy—rare in the biological world and nearly unique to humans. It opens a gradual evolutionary pathway from genetic selfishness to individual mutual altruism, ultimately reaching an ESS state. Thus, the inference of "selfish genes" does not equate to Dawkins’ claim that "genetic selfishness leads to individual selfishness." Concepts like "universal love" and "common interest," which Dawkins dismissed as "evolutionarily meaningless," hold profound practical significance within the virtue-upholding and evil-rejection mechanism.  

Altruism among virtuous individuals, premised on mutual virtue, can be selfless, sincere, and unfeigned—without pretense. As we will later discuss, this mechanism releases cooperative dividends far greater than those fostered by Tit-for-Tat Mechanisms. Dawkins also asserts, "A key quality of successful genes is their ruthless selfishness," which holds true in the grabbingism-dominated animal kingdom. Yet, in human societies bound by emotional ties through virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism, this claim is incorrect. It is precisely "selfish" genes that create individuals capable of compassion and loyalty. The "virtue" genetic strategy, selfishly transcending individual boundaries, prioritizes the collective interests of all "virtuous" genes, displaying "foresight" and "discernment" absent in most past genetic strategies. Is this not the most astute "selfish" tactic of "immortal genes"? Virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism stands as the most "foresighted" "selfish" genetic strategy to date.  

One point warrants repeated reflection: ["Maximizing individual interests" and "maximizing genetic interests" are entirely distinct—and potentially opposing—concepts.]()  

## The Core of Universal Values—"Virtue and Evil Are Repaid"  
The Virtue Selection mechanism, derived through mathematical logic as the optimal genetic strategy, surprisingly converges with the universal values distilled by successful human cultures.  

#### Confucian Spirit  
"All humans have the heart of compassion, the heart of shame and detestation, the heart of respect, and the heart of right and wrong. The heart of compassion is benevolence; the heart of shame and detestation is righteousness; the heart of respect is propriety; the heart of right and wrong is wisdom. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not imposed from without but inherent within us." —*Mencius·Gaozi I*  

Benevolence represents compassion and altruistic cooperative tendencies; wisdom represents the ability to discern right from wrong and a hatred of evil; propriety and trust represent adherence to rules and commitments, the foundation of cooperation. Mencius also emphasizes these "hearts" are innate, not cultivated. Similarly, *Old Book of Tang·Volume 133·Biography of Li Sheng* states, "Loving virtue and hating evil arises from one’s nature." Combining this with Confucian thought, we conclude that virtue-upholding and evil-rejectionism aligns with the "noble person" (junzi) in Confucian culture.

#### Chivalric Spirit  
Similarly, the core of European chivalric spirit encompasses analogous elements: Humility, Honor, Sacrifice, Valor, Compassion, Honesty, Justice, and Spirituality. Humility, Honor, and Honesty form the foundation of cooperation; Sacrifice, Valor, and Compassion represent altruistic tendencies in cooperation; Justice and Spirituality reflect the value orientation of upholding virtue and rejecting evil.

#### Bushido  
Japanese Bushido initially shared roots with Confucianism, revering virtues like "self-discipline, loyalty, courage, forbearance, and modesty." Later evolving into "fame, loyalty, courage, righteousness, propriety, sincerity, self-restraint, and benevolence."  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd84437-8ab0-4793-9dd9-7de5c81745dd" /></p>

What we modern people often refer to as universal values mostly pertain to the concepts of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" that gained prevalence during the relatively recent period of the French Revolution. However, there is a notable difference: across both Eastern and Western civilizations, among philosophers and religious doctrines alike—despite their conflicting views on numerous matters—the notion of "retribution for virtue and evil" has almost universally emerged as the most common human consensus. This concept has furthermore become a core tenet of various religions, owing to its unparalleled popular appeal. For instance, *Proverbs* in the Old Testament states: "The blameless will live on the earth, the pure in heart will remain in it. But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it." In Buddhism, the doctrine of samsara (reincarnation) holds that after death, a person's next life—determined by their deeds in the current life—may lead to one of six realms: the three evil paths (hell, hungry ghosts, animals) for those who commit evil, and the three good paths (gods, humans, asuras) for those who do good. This theory of karmic rebirth can be traced back to India's older Brahmanism and Vedic religion.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9cd941e-7df7-41a1-9d94-4a8c71b774d7" /></p>  

This widespread acceptance is no coincidence. [Retribution for virtue and evil is the underlying logic constructing human society; the fundamental guarantee enabling the establishment of human civilization; and an imprint engraved deep within the human genome.] Even the most hypocritical and eloquent deceivers dare not openly deny the justice of this principle. Compared to retribution for virtue and evil, concepts like liberty, equality, and fraternity appear relatively superficial.  

## Ten Thousand Years of "Trials" Leading to Fruition: The Evolutionary Conditions of Virtue Selection [★]  

Apart from humans, few species in the biological world exhibit an explicit "Virtue Selection" mechanism. This is likely because the strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism is both difficult to form and challenging to stabilize. It is an outright miracle in the history of life. Let us now examine the stringent evolutionary conditions required for the Virtue Selection mechanism.  

### Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism Originates from the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism  

When we closely compare the Tit-for-Tat mechanism and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, we can discern their similarities and traces of evolutionary continuity. This is also well reflected in the actual biological evolutionary tree. As we know, bats, though capable of flight, are not birds but mammals. Many mammals—including African lions and spotted hyenas—exhibit a degree of teamwork and cooperative hunting, occasionally assisting threatened or injured companions. Among mammals, however, the Tit-for-Tat strategy is most pronounced in primates.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e926f8c6-af6c-4e9c-9adf-4a92fcd4fcda" /></p>  

Among primates, many of humanity’s close relatives—including orangutans, baboons, and most species of monkeys—engage in mutual grooming. Grooming is a critical social activity for primates. Beyond its practical function, grooming serves as a gesture of cooperation, a low-cost act of proactive altruism akin to testing the waters. If individual A extends an olive branch to B through grooming and receives no reciprocation, A may discontinue this kindness and seek another cooperative partner. This behavior closely aligns with the definition of the Tit-for-Tat mechanism.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c3a28e7-8a7f-4cb8-9641-da64e3cac83d" /></p>  

Craig Packer’s 1977 long-term study at the Gombe Stream Research Centre in Tanzania documented that male baboons form alliances to confront older males, enabling one of the allies to mate with females previously controlled by the older male. Though the assisting male does not immediately gain access to females, it cooperates in the hope of future reciprocation—and such reciprocation is typically realized. Another primate, the Sri Lankan macaque, cares for injured male companions to secure their support in future conflicts, with younger males particularly attentive to the wounds of prime-aged males, who hold an advantage in disputes. A study in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, found that male macaques are more likely to mate with females they have previously groomed—a clear "reward" for their long-term grooming efforts. The Tit-for-Tat (reciprocity) strategy is even more prevalent in chimpanzee groups (humans’ closest relatives), manifesting in grooming, joint defense, childcare, alarm calls, education, mating, and food sharing.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c38ced9-9f13-4cf8-96c7-ca7876142d08" /></p>  

As the Tit-for-Tat strategy became more thoroughly ingrained, the biological and social foundations for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism began to emerge. Thus, while a miracle, it is not surprising that this strategy first evolved in humans—close relatives of chimpanzees, which rigorously practice reciprocity—and within the most evolutionarily plausible lineage of the biological world.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1617149c-aa10-4d15-af89-d50ffd4b59db" /></p>  

Let us now explore the biological prerequisites for the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism strategy.  

### Individual Recognition  

Individual recognition is undeniably a shared foundation for both the Tit-for-Tat mechanism and Virtue Selection. Without the ability to distinguish between individuals, differential treatment (the core of these strategies) becomes impossible. Do not underestimate the complexity of individual recognition: while humans excel at it, many species fail to evolve Tit-for-Tat strategies precisely due to difficulties in individual recognition. Humans, however, possess a distinct advantage in this regard—a point worthy of emphasis.  

Humans primarily recognize individuals by facial features. For years, computers have outperformed humans in computation and memory, and humans have lagged in man-machine games. Yet, human facial recognition—the "trump card"—has only recently faced significant challenge from rapidly advancing AI technologies. Even then, solving facial recognition with AI demands sophisticated hardware and software.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fa26507-5568-4335-8cc5-41c3075962b7" /></p>  

<p align="center">Deep Convolutional Network</p>  

Why do humans possess such robust facial recognition abilities? Because the human brain has evolved specialized "hardware" for this task: the bilateral occipital lobes, with functions extending to the inner surface of the temporal lobes. Damage to this region results in *prosopagnosia* (commonly called "face blindness").  

<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8065d7d-8dcb-4a04-8ff5-d5f93ab8f7f6" /></p>  

Prosopagnosic individuals, while able to describe facial features, cannot explicitly recognize faces or may experience diminished function, even for familiar faces. Some retain the ability to interpret facial expressions or match unfamiliar faces. Beyond facial recognition, their object-recognition abilities often remain intact, and many read without difficulty. Most compensate for face blindness by relying on other cues: voice, hairstyle, clothing, or gait.  

### Long-Term Memory  

Virtue Selection also requires long-term memory, as accurately assessing an individual’s virtue or evil demands prolonged interaction and evaluation. The Tit-for-Tat mechanism shares this need, though it only requires remembering how others have treated oneself. Virtue Selection, however, demands "gossip"—learning and remembering how each individual treats others—and synthesizing these assessments, which imposes far greater demands on memory.  

### Cognitive and Logical Abilities to Discern Virtue and Evil  

To implement genetic strategy selection, the ability to judge virtue and evil is essential. This judgment is a complex process requiring advanced cognitive and logical capacities, which likely served as a key internal driver of human cognitive evolution. Studies of the human brain reveal that "Virtue Selection" actually spurs evolutionary demands on the brain—a process initiated even with the Tit-for-Tat mechanism.  

As observed in vampire bats (discussed earlier), research indicates they possess unusually large brain sizes, with the neocortex (the "intelligent" front part of the brain) proportionally larger than the posterior "routine" cortex. Vampire bats have the largest neocortex among all bat species (source: *The Origins of Virtue*). Proportionally, the human brain has become the largest in the biological world.  

### Dawn Approaching: The Miraculous Initiation

Earlier, we mentioned that Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism can enter an Evolutionarily Stable State (ESS). However, we overlooked a critical question: how does Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism emerge from nothing? From where does the initial driving force originate? We need to consider how the first Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist group formed—a profoundly challenging question. For when the first Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individual appears, how does it survive? Let us assume it exists within a Tit-for-Tat group most conducive to its development. Given its genetic strategy of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, it must assist other Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists, confront and punish Grabbingists, and even counter collusive Tit-for-Tat alliances—small evil cliques. Without cooperation from other Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists, the fitness of these individuals would inherently be lower than that of their fellow group members. The probability of their survival and the survival of their offspring adhering to this strategy would also be low. Even if we invoke Kin Selection, it remains difficult to imagine how they could sacrifice fitness to maintain such a complex brain system and "meddlesome" Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist mechanisms, persisting until eventual success. Simulation programs yield consistent conclusions: Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals repeatedly mutate (we have significantly increased their mutation probability) but are repeatedly eliminated, failing to gain momentum.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c2935b-9b82-41c2-972a-e37083dcf037" /></p>  

Yet ultimately, after enduring innumerable hardships and struggling across generations, they reached a critical mass, then erupted and swiftly dominated the entire population (the red curve represents the count of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist individuals).  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91bfaf88-fc74-44fa-a5dd-a26f9c8eba1e" /></p>  

Rational logic struggles to convey the difficulty of this process. To illustrate, let us draw parallels to characters in literary and cinematic works: think of Jiang Yang and Zhu Wei from the novel *The Long Night's End* (adapted into the TV series *The Silent Truth*), or Lee Jae-han and Park Hae-young from the Korean drama *Signal*. This instinct to uphold justice and punish evil is embedded deep within human genetics. Among the heroes who truly sustain human civilization, this instinct manifests with particular intensity. They are all asked, "Is it worth it?" Though they may not know the answer, they resolutely act according to what their inner conscience deems right—a force rooted in instinct. [Only by understanding the principles of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" can we grasp why they act this way and the value of their actions. Some may think from the perspective of "selfish genes," questioning why these individuals are "foolish" to meddle. Whether their minds are clever or not, their "genes" are undeniably "wise"—they defend their genetic strategy model, preventing humanity’s Dimensional Collapse.]  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5c0b8d5-c1e7-4925-972f-e7e1ff5b1462" /></p>  
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84f0164-644b-4c4a-8d93-a5b1b5d38380" /></p>  

In the end, regardless of the path, they persisted through incalculable hardships, surviving true to their original purpose. Countless unrecorded yet heroic and monumental stories lie behind this outcome, though their specifics are lost to time. What we can affirm is that this success was extraordinarily difficult. Quantifying its difficulty directly is challenging, but we can infer it indirectly: no other species on Earth has evolved such a mechanism. Human ancestors, through successive generations, remained steadfast amid countless arduous choices. Their efforts and perseverance surpass the cumulative trials of millions of species across innumerable generations. For no other species has transcended the local optimum imposed by individual Grabbingism to evolve such a sophisticated moral sense of Virtue and Evil.  

## Period of Accumulation – "The Ice Age Was Not Just About Ice" 【★★】  
Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism further enhanced Group Cooperation Degree, leading to unprecedented intergenic group cooperation in the biological world. This made large-scale group competition possible. We observe this trend of Group Selection not only in wars of various scales within human societies but also in the small groups of chimpanzees and apes formed through gratitude and Tit-for-Tat mechanisms, where traces of group competition emerge. Previously, opposition to the concept of "Group Competition" stemmed from its use to independently explain the origin of altruism. In reality, classical Group Competition theory alone cannot explain altruism’s origin. However, when combined with the Virtue Selection mechanism, a more accurate picture emerges. During the formation of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, group competition does not occur directly but through territory occupation and a process of ebb and flow. In group competition, groups with poor or disrupted cooperation are easily eliminated. This elimination pressure does not necessarily arise from direct attacks by other groups; it may result from being displaced to resource-scarce regions as fertile territories are occupied, or from reduced hunting efficiency due to declining Group Cooperation Degree, leading to eventual elimination. In short, group competition does not always involve direct conflict.  

We know that before humanity’s large-scale success, it endured a long dormant period, which coincides with the timing of the Quaternary Ice Age. The Quaternary Ice Age began approximately 2–3 million years ago and ended 10,000–20,000 years ago. It was a massive glaciation: in Europe, ice sheets extended as far south as 50°N; in North America, their前缘 reached south of 40°N; and Antarctica’s ice sheets were far more extensive than today. During ice ages, the survival and reproduction of plants and animals are constrained, imposing unprecedented natural survival pressures.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2384763-a88c-4e6a-af99-87ec15875372" /></p>  

[Misfortune and fortune depend on each other. This period of extreme environmental harshness and unprecedented threats to human survival became the very opportunity for Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist genes to thrive.] In natural environments, the food supply per unit area is limited. In hunter-gatherer societies, early humans lived in small cooperative groups; when groups grew too large, they split. During the cold Ice Age, human clusters became more dispersed and smaller. At this time, the primary threats to human survival were the natural environment and ferocious beasts. [Under such conditions, groups with internal Grabbingism but lacking Virtue Selection genes quickly perished due to insufficient cooperation and excessive Grabbing Deficit (1+1<2). The small group size could not tolerate too many Grabbingists.] Imagine: in a world of daily uncertainty, if group members frequently engaged in infighting, shirked duties, or acted cowardly, the group would rapidly collapse. Even if individual Grabbingists survived a little longer, vulnerable humans, stripped of cooperation and targets for Grabbing, would quickly perish in the harsh environment. [Moreover, due to dispersed groups, Grabbingist genes spread less readily to neighboring human groups. Only groups that evolved selfless kinship, steadfast love, deep friendship, and mechanisms to detect and sanction internal Grabbingists through Virtue Selection could survive and prosper in such harsh conditions.] [The Quaternary Ice Age laid the foundation for high-purity Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist genes in human tribes.]  

As the Ice Age neared its end, humanity entered a period of dramatic development—the Great Leap Period. Within just tens of thousands of years, humans transformed from an unremarkable species into a global dominator. The psychological traits forged over millions of years of enduring the Ice Age and defeating colossal creatures remain imprinted in human consciousness today. The arduous struggle, overcoming obstacles through unity and cooperation, with kinship, friendship, and love as central themes; loyalty, resolve, courage, decisiveness, sacrifice, and redemption as defining marks; tales of heroism, great feats, defeating final bosses, and reaching dawn—these are the ancient storylines that resonate deeply within humanity. The narrative structures of *The Lord of the Rings*, *Dragonlance Chronicles*, and *Harry Potter* follow this pattern, yet people never tire of them.  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af76f49f-8271-488d-a594-4506d9ad8414" />

## Tit-for-Tat vs. Virtue Selection – "A Single Leaf, a Bodhi Tree; a Single Step, a Paradise" 【★★】  
Although the Tit-for-Tat (gratitude and reciprocity) strategy serves as the evolutionary foundation of the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism (both socially and biologically), Virtue Selection and the Tit-for-Tat strategy remain fundamentally distinct. Understanding this distinction deepens our comprehension of the essence and power of the Virtue Selection mechanism.  

### Moral Judgment Transcending Personal Grievances

The idiom "hating evil as if it were a personal enemy" vividly illustrates the distinction between the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Those adhering to the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism only retaliate against their own enemies, paying little heed to broader moral distinctions of "virtue and evil." In contrast, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism involves "meddling" in others' affairs: treating evildoers as personal enemies even when the harm is inflicted upon others, [even if the evildoers have not yet inflicted any harm upon themselves]. The phrase "stepping forward to right wrongs when encountering injustice" typifies this mentality.  
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59daa305-9777-4ffb-ad68-1574a282b3ad" /></p>  

We can also observe nascent social traits in chimpanzee groups. Chimpanzee societies have ruling classes, aristocracies, and occasional collective actions to encroach on other groups' territories. Their social interactions involve mutual grooming. To gain proximity to power (and thus reproductive resources), they form cliques and factions—traits resembling modern mafia organizations and unprincipled political parties. They remember favors from those close to them, reciprocate kindness, and even "go through fire and water" for allies when necessary. This represents an advanced form of reciprocal gratitude or the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism. Yet it remains fundamentally distinct from Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. The latter demands transcendence of small-group loyalties and kinship biases. Practitioners of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism not only track personal debts and favors but also observe how individuals treat others, forming objective moral judgments. They care not only about whether someone has helped or exploited *them* but also whether that individual has helped or exploited *others*. If a person treats them well but ruthlessly exploits other virtuous individuals, such duplicitous behavior disqualifies them from being deemed "virtuous" in the eyes of a Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionist. They will not prioritize cooperation with such individuals and may even seek to impose deserved punishment. Further, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionists will go to great lengths—enduring personal costs and risks—to defend virtuous individuals who have been exploited, speaking out against wrongdoers. Over time, the punishment of evil was formalized in law, becoming a foundational pillar of human societal operation. Those who uphold Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism carry an internal moral scale, judging each person they know or encounter based on long-term direct and indirect observations of cooperative and grabbing behaviors—whether these occur to themselves or to others—to assess virtue, vice, loyalty, and treachery.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c12a317-5fbd-4335-ab87-e54f3d3abeb8" /></p>  

### Further Unlocking Cooperative Dividends: The "Economics" of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
At its core, the advantage of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism lies in its superior capacity to unlock cooperative dividends compared to the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism. As introduced in the chapter *Mutualistic Cooperationism*, the "Others Are Heaven" principle holds that others often provide significant assistance at low cost to us. For example, if we fall ill with a complex condition, we lack medical expertise to help ourselves, but a trained doctor can resolve the issue with ease. Similarly, a skilled teacher can guide our growth immeasurably. However, in most cases, we lack the means or capacity to "repay" such assistance. In early human societies, there was no concept of "currency," and children lacked wealth to repay mentors. In a Tit-for-Tat-dominated society, doctors would refuse to treat poor patients, and teachers would neglect destitute students—since these beneficiaries could not reciprocate. Consequently, [such a society would forfeit countless opportunities to generate cooperative dividends]. This point warrants emphasis: *countless opportunities for cooperative dividends would be lost*.  

I once heard a story about a friend in Germany whose car became stuck in mud. Passing drivers spontaneously stopped to help push the car free. My friend, astonished and moved (as such acts are rare in their home country), sought to reward the helpers handsomely. Their reply was: "The greatest thanks you can give us is to help others in need when you encounter similar situations." Today, we can finally explain the logic here.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc34c29b-88a6-4148-b941-29ed59baaee8" /></p>  
<p align="center">Reward Chains Across Time and Space</p>  

The logic of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism genetic strategy is: *I do not care whether the person I help can directly reciprocate; I only need to confirm they are a "virtuous" individual and that my assistance will generate a cooperative dividend (i.e., the beneficiary gains more than my cost).* Thus, "virtuous" individuals do not engage in altruistic acts where their own harm far exceeds others' benefits—all decisions withstand precise "cost-benefit calculations." Meanwhile, we strive to suppress evildoers, hoping society will be populated by others like ourselves. When I face difficulty, I will naturally receive help, [enabling this society to generate vastly greater cooperative dividends than a Tit-for-Tat-dominated society]. The Germans' refusal of direct gratitude is telling: monetary gifts merely transfer benefits without creating cooperative dividends. Only by helping others in urgent need do we generate group-level cooperative dividends. In this light, the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism gene proves itself an astute "economist"!  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b8a7938-bd5f-469c-83a0-0c0c984e48ed" /></p>  

The Tit-for-Tat Mechanism hesitates to altruize freely because it fears "betrayers," whose actions could indirectly eliminate Tit-for-Tat adherents. Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, however, transcends this limitation through more advanced mechanisms, [using the "Virtue Selection" mechanism to eliminate betrayers and thereby establishing an unprecedentedly vast mutual cooperation system spanning time (generations) and space (individuals), unlocking cooperative dividends that Tit-for-Tat cannot approach].  
<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12f5275-6101-407a-946c-a2157fc978f0" /></p>  

### The Gradual Evolution from Tit-for-Tat to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  
The Tit-for-Tat Mechanism represents a precursor to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Initially, evolution produced Tit-for-Tat; later, more nuanced interest calculations emerged, eventually leading to moral assessments of individuals and even entire groups. Rewards for virtue and punishments for vice were then enacted. Under this trend of heightened cooperation, traits beneficial to collaboration—language, writing, conscience, empathy, and altruistic tendencies—evolved sequentially. Humanity entered an unprecedented evolutionary fast lane, uniting as a group to defeat most nature-bound, fragmented individuals. This was a confrontation between life forms of differing dimensions, with humanity prevailing without contest. [Tit-for-Tat marks the starting point of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, together with sexual selection forming the primary expressions of intra-species selection. The transition from Tit-for-Tat to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism further illustrates the continuity of evolution. Memory in the brain expanded evolutionary possibilities for Tit-for-Tat. By enhancing individual inclusive fitness (through limited cooperative dividends), Tit-for-Tat further drove increases in brain capacity. Genes encoding reciprocity toward cooperators and enmity toward defectors became the seeds of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. Compared to Tit-for-Tat, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism advances by considering not only how individuals treat oneself but their general behavioral patterns.]  

From the Tit-for-Tat gene emerged nascent group competition dynamics. Factional struggles between small cliques became common among primates like chimpanzees. These group competition patterns further spurred the development of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—a topic we will revisit. Initially, the inclination toward Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism may have been a mere genetic preference for personal likes and dislikes. However, individuals selected by this gene gradually inclined toward altruism, especially as sexual selection imposed unprecedented pressure to eliminate intra-species grabbing genes. For the group, this sharp rise in solidarity and mutual aid dramatically enhanced competitive advantage. As grabbing genes waned and virtuous genes thrived, virtue miraculously flourished.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc9691de-43fb-4de9-a92d-71f64186c19d" /></p>

One point worth adding is that despite the exceptionally high degree of cooperation among Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting groups, they still face various threats—such as the "cliqueism" formed by the Tit-for-Tat mechanism. These individuals, indifferent to virtue or evil, act solely based on personal grudges. They form small cliques—analogous to human "gangs"—where members display "righteous loyalty" (or more accurately, connivance) and solidarity, yet collectively engage in grabbing behaviors toward external groups. Due to their unified front, the weak strength of individual Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting members not only fails to challenge them but also invites more intense retaliation. In such cases, a higher-degree, larger-scale Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejecting group is required to uphold justice, thereby maintaining the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6ddd8d0-023d-42aa-aa9f-f90d984c5673" />  
</p>  
Though the Tit-for-Tat mechanism shares many similarities with Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, an insurmountable gap persists between them. This seemingly trivial step proves surprisingly unattainable. Consequently, species predominantly employing the Tit-for-Tat strategy struggle to advance further toward this "paradisiacal" threshold.  
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0364517e-7651-4c95-ad0b-5e2074caf414" />

## Ant Theocracy vs. Human Philosophy—"Having Both the Fish and the Bear’s Paw" 【★★★★】  
In the previous section, we compared Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism with the Tit-for-Tat mechanism. Next, we will contrast the Virtue Selection Mechanism typified by humans with the Hymenopteran Superorganismal Mechanism represented by ants. Though both ultimately aim for group cooperation, their implementation paths differ fundamentally—so much so that humans, to some extent, have chosen the opposite route.

### Deficiencies of the Superorganismal Mechanism and Individual Genetic Suppression  
The Superorganismal mechanism actually continues an ancient cooperative strategy, analogous to the evolution of single-celled organisms into multicellular ones—through epigenetic methylation, identical genes express into individuals with distinct functions, and the vast majority of individuals lose reproductive capacity. Similarly, in multicellular organisms, most somatic cells lack reproductive function (cell division is restricted to the original individual), with offspring derived exclusively from germ cells. Both achieve the "Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism" through different means. The entire superorganism has only one reproductive organ: the queen ant or queen bee. [Natural selection acts primarily on the genes of the queen herself.] A queen with superior genes ensures a superior colony; a superior colony produces more offspring, spreads more widely, and thrives more abundantly. Thus, the unit of natural selection is the superorganism composed of the entire ant or bee colony. This has been discussed in sections such as *Superorganismalism* and *Specialized Division of Labor and Dimension Ascension*, so we will not elaborate further here.  

Having introduced the benefits of the Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism in the previous chapter, we now address its drawbacks. A notable deficiency is the loss of numerous advantageous random mutations. For instance, suppose a soldier ant hatched from a queen develops a random mutation: a mandible with lower energy consumption, less self-damage, and greater effectiveness against intruders. In typical species, this "advanced" mandible would confer a survival advantage, increasing the ant’s inclusive fitness and likely propagating the trait. [However, in ants, since the soldier is sterile, its genes cannot be replicated, and this "superior" trait perishes with it.] Only mutations arising directly in the queen’s genes—and expressed as advantageous traits in her direct offspring—stand a chance of being preserved. Even if such a mutation occurs in the queen, enabling methylated expression of advantageous traits in soldier ants, if the same mutation simultaneously causes significant fitness disadvantages in other castes (e.g., worker ants), the overall colony headed by this queen may exhibit reduced fitness, leading to the loss of the soldier’s "superior trait."  

This issue does not arise in non-superorganismal (non-individually genetically suppressed) species. In such species, "soldiers" with fitness advantages can reproduce independently, unconcerned with the well-being of "workers" or "queens," as they do not rely on queens for reproduction. Since the queen has only one genome (setting aside male genes for now) and natural selection operates over the entire lifespan of the colony, [the core problem of the Superorganismal strategy and Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism is: excessively long evolutionary cycles, with natural selection and evolution occurring at the group level, making it difficult for individual traits to evolve incrementally and rapidly.] This is critical—human evolutionary speed is unconstrained by this limitation precisely because humans have chosen a different path for Dimension Ascension (a simulation program could be developed to quantify this distinction). Similarly, compared to single-celled organisms, multicellular organisms have also evolved superorganismal and Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanisms, with only a limited number of germ cells responsible for passing genes to offspring.  

### Why Can’t Every Individual Possess Reproductive Capacity?  
If, upon reading this, you naturally ask: "Why can’t superorganismal species allow every individual to reproduce?"—congratulations, your ability to grasp essential issues is acute! [In fact, most Dimension Ascension processes in evolutionary history have relied on depriving the reproductive capacity of most offspring individuals.] To understand this, we must transcend simplistic evolutionary thinking and adopt the framework of Adversarial Evolution, where [all cooperation requires suppressing the tendency toward grabbing, often enforced by mechanisms].  

Consider the human body, a multicellular organism. Suppose our offspring could be produced by any cell through budding. What would happen? Imagine: initially, cells in both hands are altruistic, exerting maximum effort to protect the body. One day, a muscle cell in the right hand undergoes a minor genetic mutation—its response slows by 0.1 seconds. Paradoxically, this "inferior," "selfish" gene survives longer than the normal genes in the left hand, as the left hand’s cells frequently sacrifice themselves to protect the body. During reproduction, since any cell can potentially produce offspring, this "selfish" muscle cell has a high chance of propagating its genes. Over time, such "selfish" cells would accumulate, resulting in increasingly "inferior" offspring.  

Even more perilous than "inferior" muscle cells are cancer cells—hyper-"selfish" cells that abandon normal functions to reproduce relentlessly. In a cellular community (the human body), they would eventually dominate—for grabbing is an evolutionary default. Here lies the "creator’s" ingenuity: to prevent cells from developing grabbing tendencies (or even "cancerizing") and losing their "sacrificial spirit," multicellular animals like humans sequester germ cells early in development, avoiding the grabbing-induced degradation caused by continuous mutation in later cell divisions. Similarly, if every ant or bee could reproduce, lazy individuals avoiding patrol, stinging, or work would gain more reproductive opportunities, eroding the collective spirit of ants and bees and driving them to extinction. Thus, superorganismal bees and ants adopt the "Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism"—the safest path to Dimension Ascension.  

### The Dual Advantages of Virtue Selection—Having Both the Fish and the Bear’s Paw  
The Virtue Selection Mechanism offers dual advantages: it preserves the self-cultivation-style evolutionary mechanism of individual mutation and natural selection, while fostering collectivist cooperation under the protection of Virtue Selection. The former ensures the retention and propagation of individual diversity; the latter grants humanity the enormous benefits of group cooperation. This balance of evolutionary efficiency and group cooperation—competition coexisting with collaboration—has enabled humans to rapidly outpace other species, driving successive revolutions in life forms within an extremely short evolutionary timeframe.  

[Intraspecific mutual aid in multicellular organisms and ants can be seen as collaboration among identical genes, a relatively easy mechanism to achieve. In contrast, human mutual aid occurs among individuals with distinct genes, transcending kinship. This represents a novel mode of Dimension Ascension, a landmark in life’s history. From this perspective, human mutual aid is far more remarkable than that among ant or bee individuals.] [Humans enjoy both the evolutionary speed conferred by individual competition and the significant fitness advantages of mutually beneficial group cooperation.] In this regard, it is no exaggeration to say that humans are the most "favored" species—this mechanism has been realized in humans alone.  

### The Importance of Individual Competition

Although this book focuses on cooperation and the origin of altruism, and its content inevitably leans toward these aspects, we must never neglect the importance of competition. In fact, the very origins of cooperation and altruism are rooted in competition.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1af36c40-8df7-4982-8049-74389c40a47c" /></p>  

Social animals in the form of superorganisms certainly give rise to many moving stories, but in reality, they resemble fanatical religious devotees who surrender everything to their deity. Having lost their reproductive capacity, they live solely for the collective. They exemplify authoritarian and collectivist societies—where every non-reproductive individual unconditionally sacrifices for the group, unique individual advantages are not preserved, and they act as puppets controlled by the queen bee through epigenetic mechanisms. Their existence serves only one purpose: to serve the queen. In contrast, the genetic strategy of humans—retaining individual reproductive capacity, preserving free will, and maintaining inter-individual competition and selection, while also cooperating and sacrificing for group interests—is far rarer. It requires an extraordinarily complex trade-off mechanism, which has given rise to highly intricate emotions such as love, empathy, self-reflection, and wisdom.

[Humans have neither chosen to be "tigers" or "dinosaurs" with unrestrained individuality, nor "ants" or "bees" of collectivist and authoritarian systems. Instead, humans have forged their own path, the most unique in the biological world, and achieved unparalleled success.]() However, this new path of Dimension Ascension is fraught with peril and instability, placing unprecedented demands on wisdom.

## The Greatest "Dimension Ascension" Event in the History of Life—Human Edenic Period【★★★】  
Readers who have perused earlier chapters are no stranger to the concept of *Dimension Ascension*. We have already discussed two such events: the emergence of eukaryotic cells through endosymbiosis and the flourishing of multicellular organisms. In fact, broadening our perspective, we find that the origin of life itself was a Dimension Ascension event, beginning when RNA learned to synthesize proteins from organic matter. Like other Dimension Ascension events, this was an extremely fortuitous occurrence. After the evolution of multicellular life, hundreds of millions of years passed, during which dinosaurs perhaps represented the pinnacle of multicellular life, achieving unprecedented biomass. Concurrently, many organisms embarked on new experiments, gestating a new round of Dimension Ascension in the history of life—eusocial organisms.  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ad522d-e3df-4cb2-be26-db2ffb2e7d5e" /></p>  

Currently, eusocial animals exhibit at least three modes: Superorganismalism (predominantly in true eusocial species), Tit-for-Tat Mechanism (paired with kin selection), and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism.  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59125ed6-7e10-4e45-bff8-e0b3ee287961" /></p>  

These modes have been detailed in previous comparisons. Among them, the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mode is the rarest and most sophisticated. Based on observed outcomes, this mode has also achieved the most resplendent successes in the shortest time. For a period following the emergence of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, I believe humans entered an era approximating the Edenic Period. Humans aided one another: the virtuous were praised, respected, and granted better survival conditions and favor from the opposite sex; the few wicked were punished, isolated, and met with disdain and contempt from others. Under the combined influence of Virtue Selection and Sexual Selection, humanity maintained an overall trend toward virtue. During this time, humans reaped enormous Cooperative Dividends, dominating the struggle for existence—even formidable saber-toothed tigers and massive mammoths fell to human hands. Humans could trust their backs to companions; love, mutual aid, and trust among individuals were unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This era saw humans as brave, knowing that sacrifice would elevate them to heroism and ensure their children’s care; proactive, understanding that greater effort brought greater reward; and fiercely righteous, upholding virtue, combating malevolence, with chivalrous spirit pervading the age. Glimpses of this can be found in the early stages of various civilizations, in the histories and deeds of figures from the early Spring and Autumn Period, and in Western epics.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d231d7e4-61bf-4a5f-b615-11fb8f4442fc" /></p>  

At this point, human evolution entered a self-consistent virtuous cycle. The common lament across societies about the decay of moral values likely stems from a longing for the Edenic Period etched into their genetic memory.  

[Since the birth of evolutionary theory, the scientific community has increasingly viewed humans as an "ordinary" species. However, from the perspective of Dimension Ascension, we have reason to consider humans a rather "extraordinary" species.]() Just as "dinosaurs" and "ants" are also unique. Dinosaurs may represent the ultimate form of three-dimensional life, with their cell count and individual biomass reaching the physical limits of nature—this path has little room for further development. Ants, leveraging the ancient "Individual Genetic Suppression" mechanism, have ascended to four-dimensional life. Humans, however, have blazed a distinct trail, achieving four-dimensional and even Quasi-Five-Dimensional life forms through the most improbable innovations, [making them the highest-dimensional and largest-biomass life form known.]() The uniqueness and greatness of humanity deserve recognition. This does not mean humans may trample other life forms; rather, humans capable of love and compassion for genetically distinct individuals are more likely to grasp the essence of Cooperative Ascension. Peace-loving, sustainability-seeking humans will also more readily unite and guide other life forms toward the next, greater Dimension Ascension.  

Evolutionary theory may have dethroned humans from a divine pedestal, but humanity need not deprecate itself. For evolutionary theory has unveiled another, tangible altar. The human species is extraordinary; the emergence and establishment of the Virtue Selection mechanism were immensely difficult, and it is not hyperbole to regard them as nearly miraculous.

The relationship between human origins and the Virtue Selection mechanism will be explored in greater depth in the *Human Origins* chapter of the second volume.
