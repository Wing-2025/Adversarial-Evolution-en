# The Origin of Virtue—Why Are We the Way We Are?  
In the previous section of this chapter, we have discussed the definition, origin, and evolutionary laws of "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism" from an abstract perspective. Despite its length, I suspect most readers still have not deeply grasped the specific behavioral patterns and thought processes of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. In fact, Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism is far from an abstract concept that merely scratches the surface; it profoundly influences human behavior and emotions. Its mechanisms shape human character and even human nature itself. It unravels the long-puzzling proposition—the origin of human virtue—and a series of derivative questions: Why do humans have moral concepts? Why do humans have a sense of justice? Are tolerance and compassion evolutionary flaws of humanity? Is there a karmic balance between good and evil? Why is kindness more prone to being exploited, yet there are still people who remain true to their initial goodness? Further, we will discover that conscience, compassion, guilt, self-reflection, integrity, loyalty, and love—these unique human traits—are deeply connected to Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, i.e., the "Virtue Selection" mechanism. Though we often refer to these traits as "precious," they undeniably undermine individual interests and reduce individual natural fitness. How, then, did these unparalleled traits in the biological world evolve? And how did they escape the fate of being eliminated by natural selection?  

## Reason Cannot Derive Moral Conclusions—Starting from the Queue Dilemma  
To explain this somewhat complex and long-standing problem, it might be easier to start with a simplified model to grasp the essence: the social moral phenomenon of "waiting in line." "Waiting in line" has become a part of daily life in modern society. We queue for buses, meals in canteens, and even for license plate applications or children’s school enrollments. In a civilized society, even if you are in urgent need, you would feel ashamed to cut in line—because you perceive it as immoral. However, if you were in a place where no one strongly condemns line-cutting, or even notices it—would you still queue? In fact, most people are emotionally and subconsciously averse to such immoral acts as line-cutting. Yet, after rational deliberation, many realize: *"Why shouldn’t I cut in line? From a personal interest perspective, there are only benefits and no drawbacks!"*  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87df1d74-551d-4835-892c-ad6d01cf45c0" />  
</p>  

Some more astute individuals might then think: "If everyone else thinks this way, it would be chaotic—people pushing and shoving, which would be worse than queuing properly." But they quickly add: "Unfortunately, I can’t control others’ thoughts"—though they wish others were less "smart" and just queued as required. Still, they feel powerless and ultimately choose to "cut in line" as a self-interest-maximizing act—because regardless of whether others queue or cut, cutting in line will always yield greater personal benefits.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb4d07d2-7b35-4922-8c90-8655489aa94e" />  
</p>  

Here, "line-cutting" can represent any act that benefits the individual but harms the group, resulting in Grabbing Deficit. The "Queue Dilemma" symbolizes all behavioral dilemmas where short-term individual gain conflicts with group benefit. Thus, ordinary reason cannot derive moral conclusions. On the contrary, the more rational one is, the more likely they are to deduce immoral behavior (unless their rationality has reached the depth of understanding this book). The Queue Dilemma is similar to the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which has been extensively studied in game theory. However, I prefer the Queue Dilemma as an example—it is more relatable to daily life, and the outcome of rational choice is clearer: under the assumption that no one will punish line-cutting, choosing to "cut in line" yields greater personal benefits, regardless of others’ strategies. Many have summarized this fundamental conflict between individual and collective interests, such as the well-known "Tragedy of the Commons," or Zheng Yefu’s observation: "Rational individuals, when aggregated, form an irrational society." Thus, the pressing question before the "creator" is: How to make humans "queue" despite personal costs, thereby avoiding massive Grabbing Deficit?  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89eda50a-aaa5-469f-bec9-7bb4eef941ae" />  
</p>  

## Virtue Originates from Emotion—Reason Is the Slave of Passions  
If human reason, our most prized faculty, cannot resolve moral issues, how did the "creator" solve this problem? Modern experimental psychology posits that any moral judgment is rooted in emotions, feelings, or sentiments (Greene 2007, building on Haidt’s social intuitionist model). Moral judgment does not stem from reason or reflection. Though you might articulate elaborate arguments to support your view, neurobiological responses reveal that your brain first generates an emotional reaction—either aversion or approval. Moral judgment precedes moral reasoning. Moral reasoning is more akin to a lawyer defending a client, selectively seeking evidence to support pre-existing moral judgments. Thus, moral reason is merely a rational veneer. In a sense, this aligns with Hume’s assertion: *"Reason is the slave of passions."*  

Take the Westermarck effect, for example, which states that children raised together from a young age will not develop sexual attraction to one another in adulthood. This effect is observable across various cultures, including Israel’s kibbutz communities, China’s child-bride customs, and other kinship-based families. Inbreeding is detrimental to species survival. While cultural norms also discourage it, the "creator’s" most reliable solution is to evolve emotional instincts to prevent it.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289bec0f-7221-4dcd-8e5f-e1b0c909565c" />  
</p>  

Let us revisit the earlier example of "theft." As previously analyzed, theft does not immediately cause obvious Grabbing Deficit; its deficit manifests over time through changes in gene frequency. Even if I have clearly explained this principle, few people—especially in primitive eras—would spontaneously grasp it through rational reflection. Nonetheless, across diverse civilizations and religions, theft is almost universally condemned. To justify this, people invoke various "theories": inviolability of private property, "do not do to others what you would not have done to yourself," Buddhism’s prohibition of "taking without consent" (one of the ten non-virtues, leading to rebirth in the three lower realms), and the Eighth Commandment of the Ten Commandments ("Thou shalt not steal"). Yet these "theories" are flawed. For instance, if private property is inviolable, why can criminals’ property or even lives be violated? The "do not do to others" principle also fails when applied to criminals. Religious justifications are even more superstitious. Given the complexity of the underlying principle, the "creator’s" simplest solution is to evolve emotional genes that make individuals indignant at theft, along with cultural "genes" that condemn it.  

## The Vessel of Virtue—Where Does Virtue Reside?  
If we probe further: Where exactly does morality reside? Modern scientific research offers some clues.  

### PFC (Prefrontal Cortex)  
In 1848, Phineas Gage, an American railroad worker, suffered a tragic accident: a metal rod pierced his head, entering from the left side of his face, passing through the back of his left eye and the posterior part of his frontal bone, and exiting through the left side of his skull, damaging his prefrontal cortex (including the orbitofrontal cortex). Miraculously, he survived and gradually recovered, but his personality changed drastically.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/037a4a3d-795f-462b-b882-fd6cba13b694" />  
</p>  

Gage was previously known as responsible, kind, and well-liked. After the injury, despite physical recovery, he became obstinate, impulsive, erratic, and crude—almost as if his "soul" had been replaced. This incident prompted exploration into a secret of the brain. Neuroscientists, using Gage as a key case study, concluded that damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was the primary cause of his emotional instability and loss of "moral behavior."  

### vmPFC (Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex)

In recent years, scientists have compared differences in moral judgment between individuals with normal nervous systems and those with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), revealing that activation in this region correlates with moral sensibility. Research findings indicate that vmPFC-damaged patients are more likely to make utilitarian choices when confronting moral dilemmas—prioritizing overall benefit over the interests of a few individuals. In one hypothetical scenario designed by researchers: A train is speeding along its track. If you push a stranger (a heavy man) onto the tracks (resulting in his death), you can save five workers further down the line. Compared to other subjects, vmPFC-damaged patients are more inclined to endorse this action. (Excerpted from *Global Science*)  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bca67c3f-82e3-4857-a72b-8246b2d5e4a0" /></p>  

Additionally, in genetic studies of empathetic behavioral phenotypes, scholars conducted a meta-analysis of seven twin studies on the heritability of individual differences in empathy. Results showed that genetic factors account for 35% of empathetic variation. Six of these seven studies found that 30% of individual differences in cognitive empathy and 26% in emotional empathy stem from genetics. Higher levels of empathy correlate with stronger genetic influence—meaning the more empathetic parents are, the greater the likelihood their children will be empathetic. Empathy is not merely an "emotional intelligence" issue; it has neural underpinnings and is regulated by multiple factors, including genetics, age, and environment. Specific brain regions involved in empathy primarily include the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); cognitive empathy is particularly linked to the vmPFC. Furthermore, environmental factors such as family member traits, parenting styles, school education, and interpersonal relationships all shape empathetic responses and the development of empathic ability. Of course, morality, as a complex behavior, cannot be localized to a single brain region—it is rooted in the evolutionary history of the human brain. Yet the vmPFC remains a critical area worthy of attention in studies of human morality and value-based decision-making.  

### Is Virtue an Individual "Burden"?  
[According to traditional evolutionary logic, if virtue evolved, it must significantly enhance an individual’s "natural fitness." Yet in reality, rigorous analysis reveals the opposite: virtue not only fails to boost natural fitness but may sharply reduce it.] This explains why people have long struggled to accept that virtue is evolutionary, instead turning to "cultural determinism" for answers. Let us first examine the burdens virtue imposes on individuals.  

#### Depression—A Potential Allergic Reaction to Virtue  
Research on depression has found that depressed patients exhibit abnormally high vmPFC activity; symptom improvement following psychotherapy or medication correlates with reduced vmPFC activity, indicating an inverse relationship. Koenigsa et al. observed significantly lower depression levels in vmPFC-damaged patients, suggesting that vmPFC damage may have antidepressant effects. These findings link the vmPFC to depression’s development. One hypothesis posits that the vmPFC promotes negative emotion generation: Zald et al. measured subjects’ negative emotional experiences over recent months and found that those with more frequent negative experiences showed greater vmPFC activity. Developmental neuroscience indicates that during adolescence and early adulthood, vmPFC neural networks rapidly mature, managing emotions via the amygdala while reducing adrenaline levels. Researchers thus propose that the vmPFC regulates negative emotions through its connections to the hypothalamus, gray matter, ventral striatum, and antagonistic interactions with the amygdala.  

Another theory associates the vmPFC’s role in depression with self-awareness and self-reflection. Studies show that vmPFC-damaged patients lack self-insight and exhibit reduced sensitivity to negative emotions like shame, guilt, confusion, and regret—emotions tied to self-awareness and reflection. In depressed patients, processing emotionally charged stimuli (especially self-related negative emotions) heightens vmPFC activity, amplifying negative emotional experiences and exacerbating depression.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd832b2-cd39-42a0-8e71-5f964a1873c6" /></p>  

Researchers such as Tangney from George Mason University and Dearing from the University of Houston found that a tendency toward shame increases psychological risks, particularly its strong correlation with depression: In a large meta-analysis reviewing 108 prior studies involving over 22,000 volunteers, shame proneness and depression displayed a clear positive correlation. (Excerpted from *Global Science*)  
[Taken together, the excessive self-reflection, shame, and guilt experienced by depressed patients resemble an allergic reaction of moral psychology.] From this perspective, framing morality as a heavy individual burden seems apt—it consumes vast energy, carries significant risks, and results in self-doubt, self-negation, and guilt; simultaneously, morality drives altruism and compensation, further reducing individual fitness. This is inconceivable in the "survival of the fittest" animal kingdom. Even calling this phenotypic trait of human genes "heinous" or "against natural order" might be accurate, yet it undeniably persists universally in human genetic profiles.  

### "Righteousness Stirred in the Heart, Unregretful Even in Death"  
Over millennia, diverse nations, societies, and cultures have independently developed their own concepts of right and wrong, morality, and justice. Yet when compared, these concepts reveal striking similarities—especially in relatively advanced civilizations. These are what we call universal values: civility, solidarity, saving lives, respecting the elderly and caring for the young, honesty, compassion for the vulnerable, loyalty, commitment, and upholding justice. However, from an "individual interest" perspective using "absolute rationality," adhering to these universally recognized values often proves disadvantageous—even dangerous.  

A historical example involves Song Jing, a virtuous prime minister of the Kaiyuan era, and Empress Wu Zetian. During Wu Zetian’s reign, Song Jing served as Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Left Censorate, renowned for his integrity and trusted by the empress. At the time, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, two brothers, grew increasingly arrogant, with the entire court pandering to them. In autumn 704 CE, Yang Yuansi from Xuzhou accused Zhang Changzong of employing the diviner Li Kongtai to prophesy that Zhang "bore the appearance of an emperor," and inciting the construction of a Buddhist temple in Dingzhou to win popular support. Wu Zetian ordered Song Jing and two other ministers to investigate. Song insisted on严惩 (strictly punishing) Zhang Changzong according to law. Wu Zetian interceded, claiming, "Zhang Yizhi has already explained everything to me—drop the matter." Unyielding, Song retorted: "Heaven and earth show no partiality." The Zhang brothers’ self-defense after exposure was unconvincing; treason, he argued, could not be pardoned. He urged transferring the case to the Censorate to uphold the law, declaring passionately: "Though I know the Zhang brothers enjoy long-standing favor at your side, I also know that speaking out may incur wrath. Yet righteousness stirs in my heart—I would not regret death."  

In that context, Song’s words were akin to "challenging the太岁" (defying a powerful authority). Though Wu Zetian, known for her tolerance in appointing talent, did not punish Song, her ruthless reputation meant his life hung in the balance. Countless such examples exist in Chinese history where integrity, justice, courage, honesty, and loyalty—far from benefiting individuals—invite misfortune. In highly competitive groups, these virtues may even endanger lives. The adage "Kindness cannot command an army; benevolence cannot govern; righteousness cannot preserve wealth; courage cannot protect life; honesty cannot succeed in business" is not unfounded—virtue imposes constraints and reduces individual fitness.  

Yet upholding justice, chivalry, and punishing evil remain enduring tropes in wuxia novels and endlessly remade films. Heroic gallantry is what audiences crave—watching villains suffer sparks applause; unpunished villains leave viewers restless. Wuxia’s appeal lies in its resonance with something primal and innate in human nature. If conscience, compassion, self-reflection, and justice offer no individual benefit, why do they exist so deeply and universally in human emotion? If humans evolved, whence did these "disadvantageous" genes arise? Some attribute this to culture, but scientific evidence (vmPFC mechanisms) and cultural guidance (schools do not promote wuxia reading) render this conclusion unconvincing.  

## Moral Sensibility—To Avoid Being a "Rational Fool"

Based on the above facts, it is already not difficult to glimpse the profound "wisdom" of the Creator—its aim is to "prevent" humans from engaging in behaviors that benefit individual short-term interests but harm the overall interests of the human group. Its method is to endow humans with emotional instincts to avoid such behaviors—compassion being a prime example. For an individual, compassion actually offers no short-term benefit; it requires diverting attention to empathize with others and expending effort to assist them. If one were to act solely to maximize personal gain, the optimal strategy would be to accept others' help without reciprocating. Similarly, honesty follows this logic: acting to maximize personal gain would mean breaking promises when expedient to secure greater benefits. These emotions constrain self-interested behavior, yet their purpose is to prevent people from becoming short-sighted "rational fools" and to avoid massive losses to the group caused by deception and internal strife.  

### Solving the Prisoner’s Dilemma  
The Creator has inscribed moral principles into human conscience and uses emotions as levers to balance behavior. This marks a qualitative leap—aligning the interests pursued by individuals with those of the group, and shifting the motivation for human actions beyond mere "self-interest maximization." This is a profound distinction between humans and other animals: emotional bonds connect the pain and joy of different individuals, forging them into a community of shared interests. Indeed, this is the most fundamental solution to both the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Queueing Dilemma. Imagine a scenario where, in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the two players could intuit each other’s pain and joy—rejoicing in each other’s joy and suffering in each other’s suffering. In such a case, the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Queueing Dilemma would cease to exist.  

### Does Greater Capability Equal Greater Strength?  
Here, we uncover a common misconception: the belief that "the more one can do, the better"—assuming that greater capability expands one’s options. However, reality contradicts this. In the Queueing Dilemma, for instance, the optimal solution lies in everyone instinctively "inability" to cut in line. Only through such instinctive restraint can we avoid the chaos and losses of a "free-for-all" scramble. Thus, a deeper truth emerges: *in a sense, civilization is not only defined by what we are capable of doing, but even more so by what we are instinctively "incapable of doing."*  

Examples of such "incapabilities" include: inability to break promises, to swear falsely, to stand by while others perish, to deceive, to harm the virtuous, to abandon those who helped us, to tolerate the suffering of the good, or to forgo punishing evil. These are the cornerstones of civilization. Such instinctive "incapabilities" are often embodied in the deeds of truly great individuals. For instance, Song Jing’s declaration—"Compelled by righteousness, I fear not death"—stemmed from an instinct to deter vice and uphold justice. He could not tolerate the Two Zhang brothers’ abuse of power and harm to the state; he was even willing to sacrifice his life to rectify injustice. Similarly, during the brutality of World War II, Einstein stated: "My pacifism is an instinctive feeling that governs me; the idea of killing others fills me with revulsion. My stance is not a product of cultural ethics, but arises from a deep aversion to all cruelty and hatred."  

A common question arises: Will AI replace humans? This ultimately stems from a "determinism of intelligence" mindset. In reality, unless AI develops "moral intuition"—an instinct for "virtue"—it can never replace humans. AI can only endure as a tool for humans, whose inherent inclination toward virtue is their foundation. Excessive intelligence in AI might even lead to its own destruction—and humanity’s—for the history of evolution teaches that the tendency toward grabbing (Grabbingism) is the easiest to take root. Computer viruses, for example, are destructive programs that "evolve" inevitably.  

*It is through first being "incapable" that we attain "superior capability"—this is the secret behind humanity’s unprecedented success and prosperity. If one day this "incapability" fades, and humans feel "liberated" or "free," they may no longer be human, and their laurels and glory will fade with it.*  

One day, we must recognize that the foundation of humanity’s brilliant civilization rests not only on what we *can* do, but far more on what we *cannot* do.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77be7c69-450d-4f44-8ae1-a06c65ea421b" />  
</p>  

## Virtue Selection—Virtue and Evil Shall Be Recompensed  

### The Queueing Dilemma  
Earlier, we explained how the Creator uses emotions to address the Prisoner’s Dilemma, but this barely scratches the surface of evolutionary wisdom. Relying solely on subjective emotions to restrain oneself from "cutting in line" is insufficient, for we remain powerless to stop others from doing so. Some might naively assume: "If everyone uses emotions to restrain themselves from cutting in line, no one will cut in line."  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311412ad-e9a6-4e3e-b0ba-59bbd5f2fee3" />  
</p>  

Reality, however, is different. Random mutations in DNA introduce diverse genetic variations. Just as genes for emotional restraint can arise, so too can genes for the opposite tendency. Even if an entire generation shares the instinct to "not cut in line," the next generation may produce mutated individuals who see "cutting in line" as trivial. Many genes function like dials, regulating the expression of traits. If genes for "disliking queues" persist, over generations, individuals who "prefer cutting in line" will emerge. These individuals will possess higher fitness than those who "dislike queues," leading to the reverse selection (Reverse Selection) of queue-respecting individuals. In this case, the Creator’s efforts would be in vain.  

### The Virtue Selection Mechanism  
Thus, the Creator devised another critical design: inscribing moral standards into human genetic instincts as preferences and aversions, and using "Virtue Selection" (Virtue Selection) to punish and eliminate genes that resist queuing. In civilized societies, most people will actively condemn or even punish those who "cut in line," while respecting and aiding those who "uphold queues." Here, "queuing" symbolizes virtues such as civility, solidarity, compassion, respect for the elderly, honesty, loyalty, and the drive to deter vice. "Cutting in line" represents the opposite of these virtues. The preceding logic holds regardless of which virtue replaces "queuing."  

### Seeking Answers in the Brain  
Punishing grabbing individuals is a key function of the Virtue Selection Mechanism. This mechanism, like compassion, is etched into the human brain. Evolutionary psychology research reveals that when punishing deceivers or free-riders (Free-Riders), the dorsal striatum—a brain region associated with reward and expectation—becomes highly active (de Quervain et al. 2004). Participants’ reward centers also activate strongly when observing cheating game players being physically punished, particularly among men (Singer et al. 2006). People feel stronger urges to punish those who evade cooperative duties within their own group than those outside (Shinada et al. 2004)—in other words, hypocritical friends are more detestable than enemies.  

### Virtue Selection: The Only Corrective to Narrow Natural Selection  
Earlier, we discussed "rape" in the animal kingdom, which applies to humans as well. Some studies on the natural history of male rape argue that rape stems from natural selection, seeking to prove it is a human instinct. This reasoning is flawed: "natural" does not equate to "right" or "justified." A simple deduction suffices: the inclination toward rape must face intense natural selection pressure—for it offers enormous benefits, requiring no cost or responsibility to increase offspring and gain genetic advantage. This "free ride" is the most efficient way for "selfish genes" to replicate. Any gene would be drawn to such a low-cost, high-reward strategy. Yet humans universally abhor rape—nearly all civilizations with achievements share this revulsion.  

During the Roman Kingdom period, the tyrant Tarquin ruled with oppression, extravagance, and violence, waging连年 wars and inflicting suffering. The Roman people endured his reign for over two decades, but their revolt was finally sparked by Tarquin’s son, who, abusing his power to rape Lucretia, the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. Afterward, Lucretia, clad in mourning, summoned her kin, begged them to avenge her, and took her own life. The Roman people could no longer tolerate this "wronging of the virtuous by the evil" and rose up to overthrow Tarquin’s rule.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6d62eeb-eecc-4e97-b4f8-60c03b693fa9" />  
</p>

The "contribution" of Tarquin's son was "outstanding"—his actions indirectly set in motion the path that led Rome to the greatness and splendor of its Republican era. All of this stemmed precisely from humanity's instinctual moral judgment and the Virtue Selection Mechanism thereby formed. From this point onward, Rome turned toward the rule of law (a quintessential Virtue Selection Mechanism) and embarked on its rise to power—a trajectory inextricably linked to the moral concepts forged in the nascent stages of the Roman people. The Virtue Selection Mechanism is the sole means within a population to counteract the myopic tendencies engendered by narrow natural selection and to preserve the dividends of cooperation. It can be said that "virtue and evil being recompensed" is not a matter of "divine will," but of human agency—it constitutes a critical foundation for the existence of human civilizational forms. By now, I trust you have grasped that the section on the origin of morality and the section on Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism are, in essence, addressing the very same subject. The former section approached it through abstract theoretical reasoning, while this section does so through concrete historical examples. [These two approaches are like different paths leading to the same destination; they ultimately arrive at the same conclusions.]()

## What Is Virtue?—The Celestial Ladder to Dimension Ascension【★★】  
Having reached this point, we are now prepared to discuss the role and significance of virtue.  

### Empathy—The Pain Receptors of High-Dimensional Life Communities  
We have repeatedly emphasized that empathy, compassion, and love in the broad sense are psychological states exceedingly rare in the biological world; they are also phenomena particularly challenging to explain within the framework of evolutionary theory. Let us attempt to clarify these concepts through analogy. Suppose each individual is a cell, and the community formed by people is a human body. [What, then, do empathy, compassion, and love correspond to? They are analogous to the pain receptors of the human body.]()  

From the perspective of a single cell, why should it feel the pain of other cells? Is this not inviting unnecessary suffering? Yet when viewed from the perspective of the entire body, pain receptors play a crucial protective role—if some cells are injured, this is detrimental to the whole body, and thus to every cell within it. The principle that "if the lips perish, the teeth will be cold" and "under a toppled nest, no egg remains intact" is one I believe all can grasp. This pain response thus helps mobilize other cells to assist the injured cells in escaping danger promptly. Through this analogy, we hope it has become clear how the "empathy" mechanism functions within the human community. [It powerfully binds human individuals together, forming an integral whole sharing weal and woe.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/100ea8f9-d0e6-4dee-9e33-c10d8c4aee3d" />  
</p>  
<p align="center">Pain receptors are distributed throughout the human body</p>  

Human society has never lacked stories of self-sacrifice. Recently, in Jingzhou, Hubei, a young girl’s head became stuck in a security window, her feet dangling precariously. In this dire moment, a young mother climbed up the outer wall to the window, serving as a "flesh cushion" and supporting the girl on her shoulders for a full 20 minutes. A driver also climbed up the outer wall to assist.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40fc308b-40e6-4020-b15b-8353ebc187a8" />  
</p>  

Such an event may seem natural in human society—children are the future of the nation, and their protection appears a given. Yet within the biological world, this is highly unusual. Even among social mammals with a certain degree of cooperative capacity, "infanticide" is not uncommon. The mother and the driver shared no kinship with the trapped girl; their actions entailed the risk of injury, which would be entirely irrational from the perspective of the myopic "selfish gene." This "overflowing" of love occurs almost exclusively in human society. When later interviewed, both rescuers gave similar responses: the mother said, "In that moment, I would have saved any child"; the driver said, "It was no big deal—it was just an instinctive reaction in a crisis." Compassion is thus an invisible bond that links and unites different human individuals. Through this bond, humanity forms a life community, a towering "giant" spanning vast distances. [Under the function of this community, the inconspicuous human species has unleashed a power unmatched by other species.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c117d982-3bef-45e1-b9ca-56174ec0f6b7" />  
</p>  

### Sense of Justice—The Immune Cells of High-Dimensional Life Communities  
What, then, do the sense of justice and the virtue of opposing evil correspond to? Within our bodies, viruses, bacteria, and even cancer cells masquerading as normal cells may emerge. These entities exploit the body’s resources to reproduce, grabbing benefits without creating value; they lack pain receptors, unable to perceive others’ suffering and act accordingly; they do not help others, focusing solely on rapid replication. Over time, these "selfish" cancer cells would overtake the body, disrupting its normal functions until the organism perishes. [To prevent this outcome, our bodies produce immune cells to eliminate these grabbers and deceivers—otherwise, the organism could not function normally. This is the role of the moral virtue of opposing evil and upholding justice.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb5b335a-6bd0-4b1c-8cc5-3482deebebde" />  
</p>  

Individuals with a deep-seated hatred of evil act out of such an instinct. *Liangzi’s Interview Records* on Zhihu features a young man who detests evil to such an extent that he once wished to sacrifice himself in resisting crime, believing his psychology to be abnormal. Yet he possesses an innate, instinctive drive to oppose evil and uphold justice. Such individuals can be said to be the immune cells of human society.  

<p align="center"><img width="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/169d9c40-ceeb-4a31-b372-11d7a0bfc43e" />  
</p>  

In essence, moral instincts are a foundational mechanism for enhancing cooperation among human individuals, playing a critical role in humanity’s ability to achieve Cooperative Ascension and even Dimension Ascension. Only when different individuals share in one another’s joy and sorrow, and eliminate genes that violate morality, can they form a tightly cooperative, non-grabbing, non-deceptive whole sharing weal and woe. Only then can humanity further leverage the dividends of cooperation to form a life community of higher dimensions.  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84f92e5c-f245-446c-9c40-bb12c5842309" />  
</p>  

Dimension Ascension is no easy feat. It has accumulated the fruits of over a billion years of evolution on Earth; it has condensed the material, energy, and evolutionary "opportunities" ceded by countless species; its formation has been marked by innumerable trials, struggles, and hardships; it is pieced together from humanity’s innumerable moments of brilliance; it endures constant setbacks and regressions, perpetually teetering on the edge of collapse and reset. It is a celestial ladder—magnificent, resplendent, yet fraught with peril.

## The Origin of Virtue and Justice—A Tribute to Fourth-Dimensional Life!【★★★】  
Having laid the groundwork, we can now address the question: Why are we as we are?—the origin of moral virtues: conscience, compassion, sense of justice, self-reflection, integrity, loyalty, and love. First and foremost, these are products of evolution, instinctual tendencies etched deep in human genes. From the perspective of individual competition, virtue is the result of "Virtue Selection." While individuals with these emotions may easily falter in extreme environments of individual competition, the emergence and preservation of virtue rely on humanity’s innate Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection instincts to conduct "artificial selection"—facilitating the transmission of moral genes and gradually weeding out immoral ones.  

From the perspective of group competition, virtue and the Virtue Selection Mechanism itself are outcomes of large-scale natural selection. Groups with a higher proportion of individuals possessing these emotions are better equipped to overcome natural disasters and foreign invasions, ultimately achieving success.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de678b6c-6a55-49ba-80fc-7cd81d627837" /></p>  

The Virtue Selection Mechanism and Group Selection are mutually causal and reinforcing. Without Virtue Selection, a united and cooperative human community could not be established, and humanity would lack the pronounced Group Selection effects observed in most species. In other words, virtue is fundamentally a group capability—it significantly enhances a group’s fitness. Group Selection also exerts pressure to eliminate groups lacking virtue. Thus, propelled by both individual Virtue Selection and Group Selection, virtue has evolved and been consolidated (since Group Selection remains a topic of debate in academia, further discussion will be reserved for subsequent chapters).  

Notably, Sexual Selection has also played an immeasurable role in this process. The evolutionary trajectory of Sexual Selection is similarly influenced by the pressures of Virtue Selection and Group Selection. Given that Sexual Selection and Virtue Selection share analogous mechanisms (both rely on emotion), they readily align in evolutionary direction. Once Sexual Selection takes hold—if human females tend to choose husbands with Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection qualities or moral virtues—the trend toward Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection within the group will strengthen and consolidate. This has profoundly aided the evolution of these "counterintuitive" Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection instincts and moral virtues.

The early achievements of Chinese civilization in human history are closely tied to the Zhou Dynasty's emphasis on moral traditions. Moreover, these imprints from the early stages of civilizational development have, in an implicit manner, safeguarded Chinese civilization, enabling it to endure and thrive for millennia without withering. The lower volume of this book will delve deeper into these phenomena and the underlying reasons.  

We have previously discussed the few instances of Dimension Ascension in the history of life. Dimension Ascension is not merely an accumulation of quantitative changes but a qualitative leap. For example, dinosaurs were likely the pinnacle of multicellular life forms—their individual biomass (as unified, single-willed organisms) was nearly the largest among multicellular organisms. Yet they remained three-dimensional life forms. Their extreme tendency toward Grabbingism made it nearly impossible for them to cross the threshold from three-dimensional to four-dimensional life. They could scarcely evolve intelligence or technology, let alone create a civilizational phenomenon comparable to that of humanity.  

### The Significance and Greatness of "Virtue"  

Each instance of Dimension Ascension brings about monumental breakthroughs in life forms; each grants higher-dimensional life forms power that lower-dimensional ones cannot rival. This is nothing short of a revolutionary event in the history of life evolution. It can be said without exaggeration that the emergence of Virtue triggered a new round of Dimension Ascension events in the history of life evolution. It gave birth to humanity as a four-dimensional life form—the most successful four-dimensional life form to date.

As previously stated, humanity did not achieve Dimension Ascension through the crude method of erasing individual genetic traits. Instead, it harnessed the more sophisticated mechanism of "Virtue"—a genetic strategy selection mechanism—to gain cooperative dividends. This was unprecedented, endowing humanity with dual evolutionary advantages. The "spirit of sacrifice" in ants requires no complex deliberation mechanisms; it relies solely on basic conditioned reflexes. In contrast, human sacrifice demands repeated contemplation and weighing of options. This is by no means a sign of cowardice but a manifestation of the wisdom of higher-dimensional life in deliberation: Is it truly necessary to sacrifice virtuous genes for short-term gains?  

Virtue—a cooperation maintenance mechanism rooted in Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—represents an evolutionary phenomenon that should not have existed in the biological world. It is difficult to fathom the countless efforts and failed attempts the biological world made to pursue the dual dividends of inheriting individual advantages while maintaining cooperative states. This mechanism, which eluded billions of years of evolution and innumerable species, was eventually forged by humanity—a species once weak and on the brink of extinction. Though we no longer know the exact trials they endured, we can confirm from subsequent facts that its emergence granted humanity unprecedented species advantages, further catalyzing unprecedented social division of labor and large-scale cooperation. In the blink of an eye within the vast span of life evolution, it unleashed knowledge and wealth that the biological world had failed to achieve over billions of years. It pushed the depth and breadth of biological cognition to the edges of the cosmos and the limits of the microscopic world; it elevated humanity to the apex of all known civilizations; it constructed the most resplendent four-dimensional life form among all known life forms in the universe, and set it on a path toward the fifth dimension; its story inspired this humble species to compose the most magnificent artistic and epic chapters in the cosmos. The vast, cold, and lonely expanse of the universe will be transformed by its grace. It is, to date, the only entity truly worthy of the title "great" in the human lexicon.

At least before the prevalence of Hypocrisyism and the rise of Group Grabbingism, Virtue and the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanism were so complete, self-consistent, and unassailable. They enabled the human species to successfully complete this qualitative leap.
