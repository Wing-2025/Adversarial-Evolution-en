# Chapter on Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism  

For billions of years, species adhering to Grabbingism have thrived in the animal kingdom, gaining widespread dominance. Since the Cambrian Period, they have consistently held sway over the Earth, with apex predators strutting and dominating the global stage. This has led people to involuntarily associate the animal kingdom with the "jungle law" of "the weak being preyed upon by the strong; survival of the fittest." Although Mutualistic Cooperationism represents a potential evolutionary trend countering Grabbingism—capable of generating Cooperative Dividends and avoiding Grabbing Deficit—it has struggled under the fetters of the "Altruism Paradox," appearing powerless. Is nature’s evolution destined to stagnate here, trapped in an endless cycle of grabbing? Are the civilizational sparks of mutual cooperation doomed to remain forever sealed away, never to see the light? The answer is no. Nature’s wisdom will once again transcend our cognitive dimensions. This chapter explores how, through billions of years of "experimentation" and unrelenting "effort," nature ultimately reversed the tides—elevating the most unlikely altruistic strategies to prominence, creating genetic strategy selection models, establishing Virtue Selection mechanisms, and thus achieving the most unprecedentedly brilliant milestones in Earth’s evolutionary history. By the end of this chapter, we will open new perspectives and ways of thinking, and the questions raised at the beginning will be addressed. Is the selfish gene theory correct? Do selfish genes necessarily produce selfish individuals? How did virtue originate and persist? What commonalities exist between ants and humans? What fundamental breakthroughs does human genetic mechanism represent compared to bees and ants? These questions will all be answered here.  

# Prologue—The "Altruism Paradox" Fails to Halt Altruistic Behavior  

## The Altruism Paradox—A Perpetual Cloud Hovering Over Group Selection【★】  

### Can Altruism Evolve?  

After reading the chapter on Grabbingism, readers likely retain vivid impressions of the cruelty, cunning, deception, and treachery in the biological world. Remember the "zombie ants" parasitized by fungi? The *Copidosoma floridanum* wasps that claim caterpillars as their own, cruelly kill them, and show no mercy to their own siblings? The cuckoos that surreptitiously lay eggs in other birds’ nests, with their hatchlings immediately learning to push "siblings" out of the nest? The sharks that begin cannibalizing each other in the womb, or the eagles where one chick inevitably kills the other? If the phrase "humanity must act for self-preservation, or heaven and earth will destroy them" were applied to the animal kingdom, it would hold true in over 90% of cases. Altruism is a luxury; even individuals with insufficient or incomplete grabbing capabilities face constant risk of elimination—animals expend far more energy than plants, and their entire physiological functions and structures are built for self-grabbing and avoiding being grabbed (see the section "Secrets of the Cambrian"). ["Altruism is a奢侈行为 for them."]()

[When placing humans within the broader animal kingdom under this context, we find humans strikingly out of place—not because humans lack cruelty, cunning, deception, or fratricide, but because human compassion, guilt, and sense of responsibility seem like ephemeral myths, rarely found in the animal world.]() Are these human emotions, which defy evolutionary logic, divine miracles rather than evolutionary products? In fact, generations of biologists have dedicated efforts to explaining this phenomenon.

### Group Selection and the Altruism Paradox  

A prominent and accessible theory is Group Selection. As early as the 1960s, Wynne-Edwards proposed the Group Selection theory. He argued that if the unit of competition in the struggle for existence is the "species," individual altruism becomes explicable. For the greater good of the entire species, individual self-sacrifice seems justifiable. A species or population whose members are prepared to sacrifice for the group’s benefit faces a far lower risk of extinction than competing groups prioritizing self-interest. Thus, the world would be dominated by groups composed of self-sacrificing individuals. This theory was later elaborated and popularized by Ardrey in *The Social Contract*.  

Superficially plausible, this theory has been refuted by many evolutionary biologists, including Dawkins. In *The Selfish Gene*, Dawkins argues: "Even within an altruistic group, there will almost certainly be dissenters (e.g., arising from genetic mutations) who refuse to make sacrifices. A selfish rebel exploiting others’ altruism would, by definition, have greater survival and reproductive success than other group members. Their offspring would inherit their selfish traits. Over generations, natural selection would lead altruistic groups to be surrounded and overwhelmed by selfish groups, erasing distinctions between them. Here, we assume the initial existence of a purely altruistic group free of rebels—an unlikely scenario. It is hard to see what could prevent the infiltration of selfish individuals, who would contaminate the purity of other altruistic groups through interbreeding. Individual selectionists might concede that groups of selfish individuals do perish; yet regardless of group extinction, individual behaviors undeniably shape outcomes... Compared to the intensity of individual competition, group extinction is a slow process. Even as a group perishes, selfish individuals may temporarily thrive by exploiting altruists." [Dawkins also notes that when scrutinizing apparent altruistic behaviors in organisms, we often uncover selfish pretenses beneath.]() [I term this theory—using reductio ad absurdum to argue that altruism cannot form a stable evolutionary strategy—the Altruism Paradox: simply put, altruists will inevitably be eliminated by grabbers, making stable altruistic individuals impossible. Whether groups perish is a distant concern.]()  

Thus, to this day, the theory that altruism originates from Group Selection remains unrecognized by academia.  

### Is Kin Selection Persuasive Enough?  

In studying this topic, some may feel that "kin selection" could resolve part of the issue, even forming a basis for precise mathematical models. Hamilton conducted extensive research on kin cooperation, even attempting to calculate biological "interest calculations" based on genetic relatedness. For example, "Under specific conditions, sacrificing oneself to save two brothers or eight cousins is a non-loss transaction." While kin selection tendencies exist, such simplification is flawed. We must account for mutations and recombinations generating maximal genetic uniqueness, which necessarily dominates interest calculations. Thus, kin selection still fails to systematically explain altruism. [Moreover, it is powerless against the Altruism Paradox.]()  

Here, I offer a brief analysis: Assume a selfish gene discovers that mutual aid among its offspring benefits its own propagation, thus encoding kin-helping instructions. Suppose it has two offspring, brothers A and B. A inherits the kin-selection instructions, selflessly aiding his brother. Unfortunately, B mutates, losing these instructions. The result: A, adhering to kin selection, drastically reduces his own fitness to enhance B’s, producing far fewer offspring than B. A’s descendants continue to follow kin-selection instructions, aiding B’s descendants, who remain selfish and lack these instructions. Over time, the number of kin-selection-deficient individuals grows, while those adhering to kin selection dwindle. Eventually, the kin-selection gene is lost.  

In the animal kingdom, numerous examples contradict kin selection—such as the 50% genetic similarity among shark embryos, yet they engage in intrauterine cannibalism, with the largest surviving. Thus, I do not believe pure kin selection fully explains altruism.  

### The Selfish Gene  

The following is the most core and famous assertion from Dawkins’ *The Selfish Gene*:  

"My (Dawkins’) view is that a most prominent characteristic of successful genes is their ruthless selfishness. This genetic selfishness often leads to individual selfishness. However, we also observe that, to more effectively achieve their selfish goals, some genes may, under specific circumstances, foster limited altruism. Here, we emphasize the phrases 'under specific circumstances' and 'limited.' Though rationally难以置信, concepts like 'universal love' and 'common interest' are evolutionarily meaningless for entire species."

<p align="center"><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7152e4d-c2b4-4e93-8cbd-c7d76d4c91f6" />
</p>He further stated: "I myself feel that living in a society governed purely by this universal and relentless law of genetic selfishness would be profoundly repugnant. Yet no matter how much we may loathe it or lament its existence, the fact remains true. This book [referring to *The Selfish Gene*] takes great care to engage the reader's interest, and if you wish to derive certain lessons from your reading, you may view them as a warning. If you, like me, desire to build a society of universal love, shared benefits, and selfless cooperation, you will no longer look to biological attributes for assistance—for our very nature is born of selfishness. Let us strive to instill generosity and self-sacrifice into human minds through education. Let us deeply understand how our genes are selfish, so that we may at least find opportunities to disrupt their plans—something no other species can achieve." [This prompts a host of questions. Is the inference that selfish genes produce selfish individuals correct? Does altruism truly have no evolutionary pathway? Are human altruistic behaviors merely the result of self-awakening in resistance to "genetic tyranny"? Is "heaven and earth will punish those who do not act in self-interest" really the truth of human existence?]() Fortunately, all these questions will find answers in this chapter.  

## Tit-for-Tat Mechanism—"Repay a Single Meal's Kindness, Avenge a Glaring Grudge"  
The Tit-for-Tat model (also translated as "an eye for an eye") is currently an academic framework that effectively explains limited altruism in the biological world. While "Tit-for-Tat" is an accurate translation from the English term, the ultimate goal of this genetic strategy, in practical effect, resembles a social strategy of "gratitude and reciprocity."  

### Intraspecific Tit-for-Tat  

#### Insights from South American Bats  
There exists a species of vampire bat in South America that survives solely on blood. By night, these bats use their sharp teeth to feed on the blood of mammals like horses or cows. Their saliva contains substances that prevent blood clotting and may even have pain-relieving properties. However, these bats do not always return successful; some return to their roosts—a cave or hollow tree trunk—with empty stomachs. For these bats, failing to feed at least once every three days risks starvation.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/154e4e2f-1005-4fd8-b697-edf3d6241d97" /></p>  
<p align="center">Colony of Vampire Bats</p>  

Research by American biologist Gerald Wilkinson revealed that satiated vampire bats willingly share their blood reserves with hungry conspecifics. They regurgitate blood from their stomachs into the mouths of begging individuals. Strikingly, they do this not only for relatives and offspring but also for unrelated peers. Yet this is not pure generosity; bat blood-sharing adheres to a strict rule—bats will not continue feeding individuals who fail to reciprocate! At first glance, this may seem ungenerous, but it reflects the evolutionary wisdom of these bats.  

Suppose bats shared blood indiscriminately. Genetic mutations could produce "free-riders"—lazy individuals who wait to be fed while prioritizing reproduction. With more time and blood reserves than hardworking bats, free-riders would out-reproduce "industrious" counterparts. Over time, free-rider genes would rapidly outcompete sharing genes. This would either erode the blood-sharing tradition or dominate the population, eliminating the cooperative behavior described earlier. Thus, unprincipled generosity ultimately harms the population. The South American vampire bats’ rule—"feed those who have fed me"—exemplifies the Tit-for-Tat strategy.  

While recognizing conspecifics and judging reciprocity requires time and cognitive effort (a significant cost for small animals), this investment is far more efficient than allowing free-rider genes to spread virally. Only populations evolving Tit-for-Tat genes avoid the catastrophic spread of free-rider genes while retaining the benefits of mutualism. In this way, Tit-for-Tat genes protect mutualistic genes, preventing populations from succumbing to free-rider dominance and eventual elimination.  

#### The Mathematical Model of Tit-for-Tat  
Tit-for-Tat adherents follow this rule: [If a counterpart is willing to give, they reciprocate, behaving like mutual cooperators. If a counterpart withholds or engages in grabbing behavior, they respond by acting like grabbingists—retaliating with their own grabbing.]()  

Computer simulations of this process reveal that blind mutualists, lacking reciprocity, are outcompeted by free-riders. Tit-for-Tat individuals, however, deny free-riders benefits while forming internal mutualistic circles—thus reaping cooperative dividends unavailable to self-cultivationists. Ultimately, Tit-for-Tat populations stabilize: introducing self-cultivationists, grabbingists, or pure altruists cannot disrupt this equilibrium. For this reason, Tit-for-Tat is termed an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS).  

#### The ESS Model  
Maynard Smith (1982) defined an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) as "a strategy such that if most members of a population adopt it, no alternative strategy (i.e., a 'mutant' strategy) can invade the population through natural selection." A strategy is evolutionarily stable if it is adopted by most members of a population and outperforms alternatives. Following environmental upheaval, populations may experience transient instability or fluctuations, but once an ESS is established, it remains stable: deviations are penalized by natural selection. No alternative strategy can outcompete an established ESS.  

The concept of ESS, which we will revisit frequently, explains not only Tit-for-Tat genetic strategies but also other adversarial strategies. Many evolutionary texts, including *The Evolution of Cooperation*, detail competitions between Tit-for-Tat and other strategies in computer simulations, which I will not reiterate here. Notably, our simulations account for the higher biological costs of Tit-for-Tat (e.g., more developed brains) compared to undiscriminating altruism (which requires fewer resources). This cost differential may explain why Tit-for-Tat is less common in the animal kingdom: undiscriminating altruism ("do-gooderism") can destabilize Tit-for-Tat equilibria.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f521f8c9-8869-4f5c-92d1-0f5ffe265fc5" /></p>  

All genetic strategies discussed in this book are supported by clear mathematical models, allowing their evolutionary trajectories to be simulated computationally. Readers interested in this topic are encouraged to explore our accompanying simulation program, which aligns with the conclusions presented here. Sometimes, understanding through code offers deeper insight into underlying mechanisms.  

### The Emergence of Tit-for-Tat  
While we have explained how Tit-for-Tat maintains evolutionary stability, we must also address its origin. In a biological world dominated by grabbingism, the "startup phase" of Tit-for-Tat is highly challenging. Consider the first Tit-for-Tat individual: its initial altruism reduces fitness, and without other Tit-for-Tat partners to cooperate with, its genes struggle to propagate.

Fortunately, we can draw on kin selection to explain this issue. Suppose a random mutation gives rise to an individual with both a Tit-for-Tat Mechanism and a kin selection tendency (i.e., it is more inclined to cooperate with genetically related individuals). Although this individual itself gains no fitness benefits from its Tit-for-Tat genetic strategy—indeed, its fitness may even decline—it is likely that its offspring will inherit both the Tit-for-Tat and kin selection genes. With these two strategies, its multiple offspring can then establish cooperative relationships and reap cooperative dividends. Starting from this generation of offspring, fitness will begin to improve. If the cooperative dividend generated by the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism outweighs the costs of maintaining it (these costs are considerable, as will be discussed later), this "Tit-for-Tat with kin selection" lineage will thrive.  

Once these genes spread widely and become dominant in the population, if some individuals lose the kin selection component of the strategy through mutation but retain the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, they will encounter mostly Tit-for-Tat individuals. As a result, they can form cooperative relationships with more individuals, gain greater cooperative dividends, and experience increased fitness. Over time, the population will thus evolve into one composed purely of Tit-for-Tat individuals.  

### Summary of the Tit-for-Tat Mechanism  
This process embodies a core philosophy of Adversarial Evolution: To ensure the long-term survival of your genes, you must not only guard against grabbing behavior in your cooperators but also actively enable your cooperators to constrain and punish you. Only through this mutual accountability can your genes avoid degenerating into deceitful and grabbing tendencies. As Chairman Mao once said, "Unity is preserved when sought through struggle; unity perishes when sought through concession." This maxim profoundly reflects the evolutionary philosophy underlying the Tit-for-Tat strategy.  

We observe that the Tit-for-Tat strategy does produce limited altruism. However, this altruism is conditional and premised on receiving, or even exceeding, reciprocal benefits (since, for example, the value of a given amount of blood is higher when the recipient is starving than when they are satiated). From an individual perspective, Tit-for-Tat therefore does not constitute pure altruism. Clearly, it remains insufficient to explain the more selfless and widespread altruistic and cooperative behaviors observed among humans. Before exploring human behavioral evolution, let us examine another remarkable selection mechanism that reveals nature’s ingenuity.  

## The Gene Self-Selection Model—"The Rong and Di [barbarian tribes] have minds unlike those of the Hua [Chinese]!"  

### The Green Beard Model  
We now introduce a genetic behavioral mechanism known as the "green beard model" (Dawkins, 1989). Imagine a gene (or a tightly linked cluster of genes) that encodes a phenotypic trait—a green beard—and drives its carrier to recognize other individuals with the same trait (other green-bearded individuals) and to assist them at the cost of the carrier’s own direct fitness. In this green beard model of altruism, cooperation hinges on shared possession of this single gene: the gene simultaneously produces the "green beard" and compels its carrier to aid other green-bearded individuals.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84d25cb5-97e5-4e8b-b62c-d4ec5d5b897a" /></p>  

### *Dictyostelium discoideum*  
A real-world example is provided by the *csA* gene in the social amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum*. Amoebic cells aggregate into a "slug," which differentiates into two parts: reproductive spores and a stalk composed of cells that die altruistically. The *csA* gene promotes slug formation by encoding a cell adhesion protein that binds to the same protein on other cells’ membranes. When David Queller and collaborators (2003) mixed wild-type cells with *csA*-knockout cells, the knockout cells were excluded from slugs and thus rarely became spores. The wild-type *csA* gene enhances its own propagation by forming cohesive cell clusters, with some *csA*-carrying cells sacrificing themselves for the reproductive benefit of others.

<p align="center"><em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em></p>  

### Plasmids  
Plasmids also exemplify the gene self-selection model. Plasmids—circular DNA molecules (rarely RNA)—are widespread across life, from bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi to plants and even humans. Primarily resident in bacteria, they transfer between bacterial hosts and form a symbiotic-like relationship: they use bacterial machinery to replicate and provide some protection to their hosts.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8455bf92-ac48-4537-9239-ac2492ddad58" /></p>  

Remarkably, these small circular DNA molecules can exhibit altruism: under stress, some plasmids direct their host bacteria to produce a toxin that kills the bacterium. If we ascribe "life" to plasmids, this constitutes "self-sacrifice," as the plasmid can no longer replicate. The dead bacterium releases the toxin, killing nearby plasmid-free bacteria, while plasmid-containing bacteria survive. Through this mechanism, the "self-sacrificing" plasmid aids genetically identical plasmids in neighboring bacteria by reducing competition—thus improving the survival prospects of both the host bacteria and their resident plasmids. [Notably, this gene strategy reveals a flaw in the assertion that "selfish genes produce selfish individuals": selfish genes can also drive altruism, even self-sacrifice—this is, in fact, a more sophisticated tactic of selfish genes.]  

Organisms following the green beard model are remarkably cohesive and robust. Why, then, are such species rare in the biological world—more common among microorganisms but uncommon in animals? The green beard model has a critical vulnerability: it cannot easily defend against "impostors"—individuals that grow green beards but refuse to sacrifice for their peers. This "loophole" has proven a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of mutual cooperation in nature, as discussed in the section "Why Is Cooperation So Difficult?" Understanding this gene self-selection mechanism will help us grasp the more sophisticated and unique genetic strategies of humans, which we will explore next.
