# Preface to This Book  
Some chapters in this book are marked with "[Optional Reading]," which readers may choose to read based on their interests. The optional content does not significantly affect the main logical thread of the book. [It is recommended that you skip this part during your first reading](). The optional sections can be revisited in a second reading or serve as extended content for readers with specific interests. Additionally, for readers with a solid foundation in biology and scientific literacy who wish to quickly grasp the core ideas of this book, [you may read only the starred core content](). If you are unconcerned with the suspenseful setup and reasoning process that unfolds gradually in the book, you may also jump directly to the concluding chapter to review the main conclusions.  

Feedback from some readers indicates that few fully comprehend this book; most understand only certain arguments they originally agreed with or opposed. Some readers tend to make assumptions based on isolated phrases and form judgments through empiricism. Therefore, it is important to note that [the Doctrine of the Mean]() is a prerequisite for understanding this book—namely, that "good" and "bad" transform based on conditions, with no absolute good or absolute bad. Clarifying the "preconditions" of my arguments is crucial.  

## Volume I: The Underlying Logic from Life to Civilization  
[Chapter on the Sorrows of Progressive Evolution,]() introduces issues and longstanding debates arising from evolutionary theory since its inception, particularly those related to Social Darwinism and Eugenics. Kin selection, group selection, and the selfish gene theory have each taken the stage but failed to convince universally. This chapter primarily raises unresolved questions in evolutionary theory, which subsequent chapters of this book aim to address. Readers familiar with the history of evolutionary theory may skip this chapter.  

[Chapter on Self-Cultivationism,]() revisits key ideas from classical Darwinian evolution and preliminarily explains the basic concepts and principles of Adversarial Evolution.  

[Chapter on Grabbingism,]() introduces the first common model of Adversarial Evolution and summarizes the concepts of "grabbing tendency" and "Law of Grabbing Deficit." These concepts will serve as critical cornerstones and basic mathematical models for the book’s theory, as well as one of the "large-scale" evolutionary laws discussed. This chapter uses extensive examples to illustrate various manifestations of this genetic strategy and how the "grabbing deficit" arises. Fascinating phenomena such as parasitoidism, brood parasitism, and intersexual conflict will be presented to readers.  

[Chapter on Mutualistic Cooperationism]() introduces the second common model of Adversarial Evolution and summarizes the concepts of "cooperative tendency" and "Law of Cooperative Dividend." This concept will become another critical cornerstone and basic mathematical model for the book’s theory, as well as another "large-scale" evolutionary law. This chapter uses numerous examples to illustrate various manifestations of this genetic strategy and the mechanisms underlying the "cooperative dividend." Intriguing phenomena such as endosymbiosis, multicellular cooperation, and superorganismal strategies will be discussed. The Cambrian enigma, a topic of much discussion, will also be examined in this chapter. Finally, we will address the challenges in establishing cooperative mechanisms.  

[Chapter on Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism]() is a pivotal chapter that bridges earlier and later content. It introduces the Altruism Paradox, Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, Green-Beard Model, and other concepts, leading to discussions of genetic behavioral strategy selection models, the Virtue Selection mechanism, and the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection mechanism. Through this, we gain insight into the unique evolutionary mechanisms of humans, the most distinctive species in the biological world. If the first four chapters focus on raising questions, this chapter begins to address the issues posed at the outset. It will resolve longstanding puzzles such as how altruism evolves and the origin of virtue.  

[Chapter on Hypocrisyism]() introduces another genetic strategy that has emerged through Adversarial Evolution in response to the Virtue Selection mechanism. It represents a significant hidden crisis in human civilization following the flourishing of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism. This chapter will discuss unwritten rules, integrity, distorted moral values, PUA, and the trend of societal cancerization. Through various examples and perspectives, it analyzes the harm this genetic strategy inflicts on human society.  

[Chapter on Group Selection]() establishes mathematical models to discuss group selection mechanisms. Using the origin of sexual reproduction as an example, it explores the operational principles of long-term group selection mechanisms. This chapter will address concepts such as alarm-calling phenomena, Sexual Selection, parthenogenetic degeneration, epigenetic mechanisms, and the XY Chromosome Mechanism, thereby clarifying how group selection exerts profound influences on species evolution at the biological mechanism level.  

[Chapter on the Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model and Group X-ism]() further describes the macro-picture of Adversarial Evolution and proposes the Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model and the Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma. This dilemma can be seen as the objective law underlying the tragedies and dilemmas of various stages in human civilization. Through this chapter, we extend life’s laws to the realm of human civilization—civilization is life. We can use unified laws to examine human civilization and even the future of cosmic life.  

Finally, in the concluding chapter, I will combine the theories of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension to delve deeper into long-debated topics such as "competition and cooperation," "collectivism and individualism," "the selfish gene," "Virtue and Justice," "the Gaia Hypothesis," and "the meaning of human existence." It is hoped that these discussions will penetrate to the core and thoroughly clarify the doubts in readers’ minds.
