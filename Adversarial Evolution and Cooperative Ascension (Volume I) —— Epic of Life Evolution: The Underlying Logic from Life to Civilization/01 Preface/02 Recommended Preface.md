# Preface
The German philosopher Immanuel Kant once said: "There are only two things in this world that fill our hearts with profound awe: the boundless starry sky above us and the moral law within us." In my understanding, this famous quote left an invaluable spiritual legacy for later generations by illuminating the importance of igniting the beacon of morality, upholding moral principles, pursuing great virtue in life, and continuously exploring the uncharted frontiers of humanity. After taking time to review the manuscript titled *Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension*, I believe the author, as a scholar, has made a commendable stride in exploring these uncharted territories of human knowledge! This is a rare and valuable book.

The author employs theories of programming algorithms and a wealth of factual evidence to unravel the evolutionary processes of biological life and the rise and fall of civilizations, identifying numerous patterns and commonalities within them. This provides us with a brand-new perspective on the living world and even human society. In expounding the theory of Adversarial Evolution, the book adheres to scholarly principles of clarifying origins and correcting misunderstandings, presenting in a popular science format the narrative from the origin of life on Earth to the flourishing of biodiversity, from the emergence of humans to the birth of human civilization, and from the contradictions and crises of human civilization to where it should go. Through this theoretical framework, the author helps people re-understand themselves and re-examine the past and future of human civilization. In this sense, the publication of this book will greatly contribute to humanity's self-understanding and its efforts to shape the future!

While reading the manuscript, I was captivated by the author's profound thoughts and the blend of gravity and wit in their philosophical insights, making it impossible to put the book down. Within its pages, the author uses the thread of Adversarial Evolution to connect the past and present of biological evolution, reveal the origins of human evolution, and explore the laws governing the rise and fall of human history and civilizations. I believe this book will benefit readers of all backgroundsâ€”whether erudite scholars or general readers. For general readers, it will, when combined with their personal life experiences and unique perceptions of life, provide insights into the philosophical wisdom expounded in the philosophy of life, evoking a sense of sudden clarity from the depths of their hearts and an involuntary exclamation of "So that's how it is!" For scholars, this book serves as an excellent reference in the field of the philosophy of life, holding significant value for academic study. In short, opening this book is sure to bring benefit. This is my preface.
