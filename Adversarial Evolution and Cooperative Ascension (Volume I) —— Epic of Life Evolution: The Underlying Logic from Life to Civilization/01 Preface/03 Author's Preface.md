# Preface  

This book primarily explores the intrinsic laws and underlying logic of the evolution of life and civilization. Namely: Where do we come from? Why are we as we are? Where are we heading? The book commences with evolutionary theory as its entry point, takes the course of life evolution as its fundamental thread, and delves into the relationships between cooperation, competition, life evolution, and even the advancement of civilization. In this process, it will also thoroughly address long-standing questions, such as: Is the selfish gene theory correct? How do selfish genes evolve altruistic behaviors? What is the origin of virtue? What are the definitions of Virtue and Justice? What is the secret of the Cambrian Period? Is the Dark Forest Rule valid? What are the underlying causes of the decline of the Zhou Dynasty and Rome? Finally, I will interpret humanity’s position, mission, and existential significance within the long river of life evolution by integrating the macro trends of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension.  

Many eminent scholars have discussed cooperation. Bertrand Russell even stated, "The only thing that can save humanity is cooperation." There are also numerous books that address cooperation from the perspectives of life and social evolution. Classic examples include *The Evolution of Cooperation* and *The Complexity of Cooperation* by Axelrod, the proposer of the "repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game program competition." In recent years, there have been *SuperCooperators* by Harvard University’s renowned biologist Professor Martin A. Nowak, and *Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny* by evolutionary psychologist Robert Wright, hailed as one of the world’s most influential thinkers. Even *Scale* by Geoffrey West, director of the Santa Fe Institute for Complexity Science, essentially embodies the principles of cooperation. Although these books use different terms—non-zero-sum games, scale effects, complex systems—the underlying logic of these superficially distinct terms is closely interconnected. [While the term "cooperation" can reflect these phenomena and laws, it is insufficient to encompass them entirely. However, until a more precise term is found, I will tentatively refer to it as "cooperation."]()  

Given that so many distinguished scholars have written on this topic, and their books are exceptionally insightful, it might seem there is little left for me to contribute. This appears to be the case; when I read Professor Nowak’s and Mr. Wright’s works, I had the illusion of reading my own book. Confronted with most of their viewpoints and even their illustrative examples, I found that my perspectives and even my modes of exposition were strikingly similar. Nonetheless, I believe there remains a necessity to continue discussing this topic. Their works focus more on the benefits of cooperation and examples of cooperation. With their foundational work, this book need not expound extensively on the role of cooperation; instead, it will emphasize the factors that disrupt cooperation, why cooperation is so rare in nature—particularly among animals—why maintaining cooperation is so difficult, and the sophisticated mechanisms nature has devised to sustain cooperation. I can assert with full responsibility that one cannot truly understand cooperation without comprehending the challenges it faces. Only by understanding these challenges can we glimpse the extraordinary evolutionary processes underlying the most familiar of phenomena. Only then can we discern the underlying logic of the complex and fascinating world.  

Among these mechanisms, humanity’s cooperation mechanisms are undoubtedly exceptional. What, then, are the mechanisms by which humans sustain cooperation? Is it merely the "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, the winner of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma competition? When discussing cooperation, ants and their hymenopteran relatives are outstanding representatives in the animal kingdom—are humans merely following in their footsteps, or have we advanced further? Are individualism and collectivism merely opposites, or can they be unified? What little-known efforts and sacrifices have species made for the sake of cooperation? These questions will all find answers within this book.  

Another thread of this book concerns the evolutionary origins of altruism. While this book does not oppose the basic premise of the "selfish gene" theory, it will use this foundational theory to demonstrate how individuals evolve sincere and pure altruism. As for the adversarial game laws of group evolution, they have rarely been discussed thus far, yet they are precisely an extension of individual evolutionary laws. Group evolution and individual evolution share many similarities, making them well worth exploring.  

It is well known that Axelrod’s *The Evolution of Cooperation* pioneered the use of program simulations to analyze biological evolutionary laws. This approach has proven concise and effective, and his research methods have been widely acclaimed within the field. As an algorithm engineer by profession, I highly endorse such research methods. From the outset, I have paid close attention to the mathematical models and algorithmic principles underlying evolutionary laws. Therefore, I have developed mathematical models and written evolutionary simulation programs for the book’s primary inferences. Through simulating evolutionary processes with these programs, we obtain conclusions that align perfectly with the book’s logical reasoning. Despite the risk of sounding self-promotional, I strongly recommend this book to all readers. [The primary appeal of this book lies in the "large-scale" laws it summarizes.]() "Large-scale" means these laws remain applicable across extremely broad spatiotemporal scales. Professor Geoffrey West notes in *Scale* that the mass scale of life forms spans 30 orders of magnitude. This range is far broader than the ratio between the Earth’s mass and the entire Milky Way. In fact, the laws of life evolution have even transcended the scope of Newtonian physics. Within such an extensive range, the laws of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension remain consistently applicable, and it is nearly predictable that they will continue to hold in even broader domains beyond most physical laws. Whether spanning hundreds of millions of years or mere minutes, whether encompassing large entities like companies, societies, nations, or even human civilization, or small entities like micrometer-scale prokaryotic life forms, the laws presented in this book can be distilled. Using the core logic of this book, one can essentially interpret the underlying principles of evolution from life to society and civilization.  

This is a book that grows on the reader. Its conclusions are derived through layered deductions, and I hope readers will maintain sufficient patience. I am confident that persistent readers will gain substantial insights. Finally, I must emphasize that some arguments in this book are innovative; I encourage readers to maintain independent thinking and critical spirit. Only in this way can this book truly serve as a catalyst, helping us collectively construct new frontiers of human knowledge.
