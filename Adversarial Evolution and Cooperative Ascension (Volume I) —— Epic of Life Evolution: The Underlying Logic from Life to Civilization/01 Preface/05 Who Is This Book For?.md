# Who Is This Book For?  
This is a popular science book. Although it involves some concepts from biology and computer science, I have written it in a way that is both profound and accessible. Even readers without prior knowledge of these fields will not be hindered in their understanding. So, who is this book suitable for?  

- Readers interested in the laws of biological evolution and the theory of *The Selfish Gene*, especially those who harbor doubts about it.  
- Readers curious about the origin, future, and destiny of humanity, as well as the underlying laws governing the development of human history. You may also read this book as a grand historical work akin to *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*. It delineates the magnificent history of evolution from single-celled prokaryotes to humans, along with the deep-seated laws that underpin it.  
- Readers engaged in scientific research. This book proposes numerous novel ways of thinking and theoretical frameworks, offering fresh perspectives and ideas for research. Many apparent phenomena can find fundamental explanations through the theories of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension. Examples include the Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism, the significance of cancer-suppression systems, the implications of parthenogenetic tendencies, Imprinting Genes, and the XY Chromosome Mechanism—research angles that have often been overlooked in the past.  
- Readers interested in algorithm design. Algorithm design falls within my professional scope, and understanding this book from an algorithmic perspective will offer manifold conveniences. After reading, we will recognize that nature is a great algorithm designer, and Adversarial Evolution is an "algorithm-generating algorithm" it has inadvertently created—one that, despite its seemingly simple rules, is infinitely complex and ingenious. Countless sophisticated algorithms (mechanisms) have emerged from this. While the book touches on biology, history, anthropology, sociology, and politics, it ultimately discusses the philosophy of algorithms.  
- If you are an entrepreneur or corporate manager, this book will provide deep insights into the secrets of large companies' success, enabling you to grasp the underlying logic of true business success at its core. It also clarifies the inevitability and gravity of "large-company syndrome," helping you take preventive measures early.  
- If you are a content creator, the theoretical framework of this book will assist you in constructing a new worldview and value system; it will endow novels, games, films, and animations with fresh creative ideas and value orientations.  
- If you are a kind person who often feels perplexed by societal issues, this book is a must-read. It will reconstruct humanity's morality and values, thereby rebuilding human confidence and foresight.  

This is also a book of wisdom, revealing the underlying logic and developmental trends of the living world. It is suitable for every reader concerned with their own destiny and that of humanity.  

Additionally, this is a book on collective success—distinct from all past expeditious, individual-focused self-help books. The more people read it, the greater the success you will achieve.
