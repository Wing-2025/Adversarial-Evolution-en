# What is Adversarial Evolution?  
While it is still premature to delve into this proposition that runs through the entire book, the truth is that most of the book does not focus on the concept of Adversarial Evolution itself, but rather uses the thinking mode of Adversarial Evolution to analyze the evolutionary laws of things. Through this process, readers can gradually understand the specific significance of Adversarial Evolution. If you are eager to gain a general understanding of the basic concept of "Adversarial Evolution," the several names I have given it will provide you with a glimpse. These names are: Adversarial Evolution, Relative Evolution, and Game Evolution; of course, if you prefer to use the more familiar term "progressive evolution" instead of "evolution," it is also acceptable, resulting in: Adversarial Progressive Evolution, Relative Progressive Evolution, Game Progressive Evolution, or even "Relativity of Progressive Evolution" would not be too far - fetched. However, I do not particularly favor the inaccurate term "progressive evolution" – because we observe that many evolutionary outcomes are, to some extent, "degenerative."  

The term "Adversarial" is borrowed from the intriguing network model in deep learning: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). It refers to the process where the generator and discriminator serve as dynamic environments for each other and evolve simultaneously. This process bears significant similarities to the process of biological evolution. Compared to traditional evolutionary theory, the theory of Adversarial Evolution places greater emphasis on the [variability and plasticity]() of the environment; it highlights that the direction of evolution is relative, not absolute. Moreover, precisely because the environment is malleable, life has discovered the诀窍 for rapid advancement over the long course of biological evolution – transforming the biological environment and engaging in deep cooperation with it, ultimately achieving Dimension Ascension. Therefore, a more detailed examination of the history of biological evolution reveals it to be a history of life's Cooperative Ascension.  

This somewhat procedural theory possesses a fascinating analytical power, unifying humanity's past "blind men touching an elephant-like" understanding of the evolutionary laws of all things through a logic closer to mathematics. In fact, this book I have written merely marks the beginning; more systematic research and applications can emerge from this foundation. Within the pages of this book, we will, through the thread of Adversarial Evolution, connect the past and present of biological evolution; uncover the origin of humanity; and explore the laws governing the rise and fall of human history and the prosperity and decline of civilizations.
