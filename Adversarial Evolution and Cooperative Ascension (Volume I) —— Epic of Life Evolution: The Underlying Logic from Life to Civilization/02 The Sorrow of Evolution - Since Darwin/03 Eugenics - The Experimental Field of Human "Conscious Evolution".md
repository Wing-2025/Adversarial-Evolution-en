# Eugenics—The Experimental Field of Mankind's "Conscious Evolution" [Optional Reading]  
Eugenics, this school of thought, pushed Social Darwinism to its extreme. Eugenics was not initially labeled as pseudoscience; in its early days, it was quite respected. In fact, Eugenics is easy to understand. In the most colloquial Chinese terms, it is: "A hero father begets a valiant son; a dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix, and a mouse's son knows how to dig holes."  

## The Father of Eugenics—Galton  
Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, proposed the theory of Eugenics with Darwin's support and encouragement. He argued that "excellent human races" should be bred like superior crops and livestock to gain stronger competitive advantages. Galton also traveled extensively, possessed a broad range of knowledge, wrote profusely, and proposed numerous theories, among which "Eugenics" gained the greatest fame and exerted the widest influence.

Galton believed that if nature could drive the evolution of animals through the struggle for existence and selection, then could not human progress also be accelerated through artificial intervention! By using "non-natural selection" to identify the strongest, most intelligent, and "most suitable" humans and enabling them to reproduce, humanity could, within a few decades, catch up with the evolutionary strides nature had taken over hundreds of millions of years. To validate his theory, Galton began compiling family trees of notable figures. He analyzed 605 celebrities who lived between 1453 and 1853 and found that 102 of them were related by kinship—meaning one out of every six successful individuals had relatives listed in the family trees. Galton estimated that if a successful person had a son, the child would have a 1/12 chance of distinguishing himself later in life. In comparison, this probability was 1/3000 for randomly selected ordinary individuals.  

Under the lens of Eugenics, the population was divided into "superior citizens" and "inferior citizens," with personal wealth as the criterion. However, there were confounding factors—for instance, much of an individual's wealth was inherited from their parents, which did not reflect their personal ability. Thus, Galton proposed a revised plan: success should be measured by an individual's actual income to eliminate the illusion created by parental wealth. In his view, those with higher incomes were truly successful. Yet, from a biological perspective, wealth is an artificial standard; biology only concerns who leaves more and healthier offspring. By this standard, a paradox might emerge in human society: those who work tirelessly to accumulate wealth may leave fewer descendants, while idle individuals might have more children. Eugenics proponents worried that this would significantly lower the overall quality of society.  

Galton further refined his research, which contributed to the advancement of biostatistics and laid the foundation for Eugenics as an important discipline. To optimize eugenic standards, Galton conducted extensive family surveys and in-depth studies on the relationship between human intelligence and heredity, concluding that intelligence is heritable. He claimed that "the talents of judges are often inherited" and that "excellent races" are superior because they are innately so. In Galton's view, the offspring of the nobility were often intelligent, healthy, physically attractive, and morally upright; in contrast, lower-class families were consistently ignorant, prone to illness, and prone to crime. To further develop this theory, Galton established the National Eugenics Laboratory in 1904 to promote his ideas.  

The theory of Eugenics sounded plausible, but despite several adjustments, practical results remained elusive. Instead, it later gave rise to the evil fruits of Nazism. Why did this happen? Galton, Pearson, and other Eugenics advocates were individuals of high moral character with profound scientific literacy; they also possessed long-term vision and dedicated their lives to the future well-being of humanity. Their academic rigor and mathematical proficiency were also admirable. Yet, where did the flaw lie? What was fundamentally wrong with Eugenics, leading to a disconnect between theory and outcome? This is one of the questions this book will explore and address later.  

## Nazi Eugenics—The "Evil Blossom" of Evolutionary Theory  
Originating in Britain, Eugenics later influenced the world, with Germany being its most "resolute" practitioner. Ultimately, it, along with racism, became the ideological foundation for World War II and the various atrocities committed by the German army.

Hitler once expressed his understanding of natural selection to his followers: "Heaven has bestowed abundant resources upon humanity, but they must strive continuously; heaven does not place food directly into their hands. All is just and correct, for it is the struggle for existence that leads to the survival of the fittest."

When condemning Hitler's crimes, some have noted that his words and actions were rooted in a solid psychological foundation. One of the primary reasons—or pretexts—for his initiation of World War II directly stemmed from "Social Darwinism." His advocacy of strict Eugenics was also grounded in the "struggle for existence" as a scientific rationale. This charismatic fanatic believed that continuous war would strengthen humanity. With great enthusiasm, they established a "Racial Hygiene" association to vigorously promote eugenic measures beneficial to the "race" in Nazi Germany. Tens of thousands of mentally ill individuals were sterilized; "excellent" women were urged to bear more children to mass-produce what they deemed the highest "Aryan race." In German, "Aryan" means "noble," and by adopting this term to name their race, Hitler did not consider himself to be doing evil. In their view, the Nordic and Germanic peoples were the purest "Aryans," superior to Yellow and Black races. He promoted the theory of superior bloodlines, advocating "survival of the strong" and "eliminating lives without survival value" to establish a "superior race." To legitimize his ideology, he employed various forms of美化宣传 (glorified propaganda): besides "preventing unhealthy children from being born to spare innocent lives," he also promoted "population optimization" as a path to the great rejuvenation of Germany. Hitler mentioned on multiple occasions that achieving the goal of "producing one million children annually while eliminating seven to eight hundred thousand of the weakest" would enhance national strength and pave the way for resurgence.  

By the end of Nazi rule in 1945, 400,000 people had been forcibly sterilized, accounting for 1% of Germany's total reproductive-age population at the time. Most victims were poor women from the lower classes. Over 5,000 women and 600 men died from surgery or infection. Many others became disabled and suffered lifelong pain, leading some to commit suicide. To "eliminate the weakest," the Nazis established the later-infamous Children's Department, building over 30 institutions across Germany to house 20,000 children and adolescents with disabilities or mental illnesses. These institutions conducted unethical human experiments, resulting in over 5,000 deaths. Meanwhile, under the guise of "euthanasia," the Nazis systematically "eliminated lives without survival value" by gassing, drugging, or starving disabled individuals, the mentally ill, and those deemed "socially deviant." The number of victims, initially estimated at 70,000 based on surviving records, has been revised to approximately 200,000 in recent research.  

The well-known concentration camps and the Holocaust were another bitter fruit of Nazi Eugenics. After the war, the world has repeatedly asked: Why did the Germans, known for their rationality, commit such inhumane atrocities? What motivated Hitler and the Nazi Party to be so fanatical about genocide? Hitler himself provided an answer in his autobiography *Mein Kampf*—he firmly believed in "survival of the fittest, elimination of the unfit, and the right of the strong to dominate the weak." William L. Shirer, author of *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich*, commented that Hitler's ideology was an immature form of Darwinism. Hitler's views were quintessentially eugenic: allowing only pure-blooded, healthy individuals to reproduce was "positive eugenics"; committing genocide against "inferior races" was "negative eugenics."

After the painful baptism of World War II, Eugenics is no longer recognized by mainstream views. However, the ideas of Social Darwinism persist. Even if not explicitly promoted, many people still intuitively adhere to this line of reasoning: humans are just animals, following the survival rules of most animals—"the strong prey on the weak; only the strong survive, and the weak perish," which seems natural and justified. [To eliminate this psychological crisis, many have even rejected evolutionary theory at a fundamental level, preferring to believe in creationism, intelligent design, or even cultural determinism. This has indirectly fueled debates about evolution in the United States and globally over the past century.]() Due to space constraints, this book will not elaborate further.
