# Tragedy of Progressive Evolution: The Puzzles Left by Evolutionary Theory for Later Generations【★】  
This has been a great debate spanning two centuries. At the heart of this storm lies the question: Are human consciousness and behavior instinctual traits derived from progressive evolution? The core issue within this storm further narrows down to: Can the selfless altruism often displayed by humans emerge within the framework of evolutionary theory? To address these questions, the scientific and sociological communities have found themselves in a dilemma. On one hand, some forward-thinking individuals argue that evolutionary theory can serve as a universal framework to explain the behavioral laws of the entire world, including human society—for instance, Wilson’s *Sociobiology: The New Synthesis*. However, these theoretical frameworks contain more or less flaws, making it difficult to gain full public trust.

On the other hand, people have also identified deficiencies in the application of evolutionary theory. [Until these deficiencies find reasonable explanations, the logic of "the strong preying on the weak" and robber-like reasoning may be exploited; vulnerable groups and the poor may be deemed deserving of exploitation and harm; selfless altruism may lose its justification and be labeled as weakness or stupidity; the maxim "man is not for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him" may prevail; and "success" attained through scheming, infighting, exclusion of dissent, lies, and fraud may even become objects of worship.]()

In the 21st century, biological progressive evolution is now an accepted scientific fact. Through advancements in molecular biology, genetics, archaeology, genomics, and even explorations of human behavior, psychology, and genes, people have continuously validated the correctness and scientific rigor of evolutionary theory across various fields. In this process, discoveries related to evolutionary theory—including the neutral theory of molecular evolution, group selection and hierarchical selection theories, and epigenetics—have rarely contradicted classical evolutionary theory. Instead, they have deepened and reinforced its theoretical foundations. Yet, its position remains awkward: Rational individuals, seeing overwhelming factual evidence, acknowledge that evolutionary theory is an irrefutable scientific truth. However, whenever evolutionary theory is used to deduce human social activities, the outcomes almost always deviate from expectations. Meanwhile, more emotionally inclined individuals cannot accept evolutionary explanations for human activities at all; they would rather abandon the scientific spirit of seeking truth and turn to the缥缈 (ethereal) theory of creationism. [Certain extreme inferences from evolutionary theory have pushed human society into a perilous state, even teetering on the edge of self-aberration. These inferences have misdirected and deeply distorted human values, economic outlooks, cultural perspectives, and conceptions of success, exerting an indelible influence on modern thought and life.]()  

Emerging trends in recent years—such as progressivism, success studies, the theory of moral futility, money worship, egoism, and even the robber logic of the strong preying on the weak—are, to some extent, linked to these evolutionary inferences. If these inferences are flawed, their impact may lead to unforeseen disasters in the future.  

## Returning to Darwin  

In fact, Darwin himself had long recognized the differences between human society and natural animals, as well as the need to supplement and refine his theoretical framework. He simply had not yet fully clarified this issue. Here, I can cite original passages from Darwin’s works to illustrate this point. [In Chapter 2 of *The Descent of Man*, Darwin wrote: "I admit that in the earlier editions of the *Origin of Species*, I probably attributed too much to the action of natural selection, or the survival of the fittest," and "I believe this to be one of the greatest oversights as yet detected in my works."]() He further stated in the same book: "In many cases, sexual selection has played a role as important as natural selection, and sometimes even more so."; "Do as you would be done by—is the foundation of morality. [Thus, we can hardly overrate the importance of the love of praise and the dread of blame during primeval times.]()"  

Darwin’s writing was always rigorous, rarely employing such impassioned language. This indicates that Darwin himself had long been aware of the deeper evolutionary laws this book will explore. Through subsequent chapters, readers will find that evolutionary theory remains correct and profound, though its theoretical details require supplementation and refinement. Just as Newtonian mechanics can only explain low-speed motion, and relativity theory is needed to correctly understand the physical world at high speeds, simplistic inferences based on incomplete evolutionary theory may be erroneous. Only by incorporating more precise theories can we achieve clearer explanations. Through this book, readers will find answers closer to the truth regarding the aforementioned questions, discover the trajectory of human evolution, appreciate the greatness of humanity, and remain vigilant to the crises facing humankind.
