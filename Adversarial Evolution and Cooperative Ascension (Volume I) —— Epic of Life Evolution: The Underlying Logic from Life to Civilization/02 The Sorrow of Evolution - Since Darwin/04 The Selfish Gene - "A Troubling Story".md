# The Selfish Gene—"A Disconcerting Tale"  
Public opposition to evolutionary theory stems more from emotional sentiment; yet, scientific inquiry into evolution has never stagnated. Among these, Richard Dawkins' *The Selfish Gene* has exerted an especially profound impact on the general public. This book elevates the concept of individual selfishness to the level of genes, using copious evidence and layered arguments to refute the theory of Group Selection, explain the principles of kin selection, clarify the reasons behind altruistic behaviors in ants and bees, and reveal the underlying selfish motives of certain limited altruistic acts. Dawkins concludes in the book: "One of the most prominent characteristics of successful genes is their ruthless selfishness. This genetic selfishness often leads to individual selfishness... For entire species, concepts like 'universal love' and 'common interests' are utterly meaningless in the context of evolutionary theory."

Upon its publication, this book sparked enormous debate. Confronted with the theory of selfish genes, many rational, scientifically literate scholars expressed unprecedented helplessness and despair. Randolph Nesse once wrote: "Human altruistic behavior is driven by genes seeking to fulfill their own interests—this is the most disconcerting discovery in the history of science. After first hearing this theory, I couldn't sleep for days, constantly trying to find a more moderate explanation for human Virtue and Evil. Once people understand this discovery, they may feel no longer bound by moral constraints, for if virtuous conduct is merely a strategy to satisfy the greed of human genes, it seems foolish to restrict oneself with morality. I feel embarrassed to admit that several of my students stopped attending my classes afterward; they believed the selfish gene theory fully explains all human selfish behaviors. Their thinking was naive, and though I tried to explain the fallacies of this naturalist perspective, my efforts proved futile."  

Mr. Wu Guosheng, Director of the Department of History at Tsinghua University, also wrote: "[After hearing Dawkins' tale of genes, humanity should feel despair. Existence is both accidental and absurd. The meaning of life is negligible. Acts of self-sacrifice for righteousness and unflinching acceptance of death, which are so noble and glorious in the human world, are entirely irrational in the so-called objective world. The rift between humanity and the world created by modern science, now more refined and rationalized, seems even harder to bridge.]"  

As if anticipating such confusion, Dawkins adds in the book: "Humans may possess an extraordinary trait—the capacity for genuine, selfless altruistic behavior. I hope this is true, though I will not debate this point or speculate on whether this trait can be attributed to the evolution of memes. What I will clarify is that even if we focus on the darker side and assume humans are fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight—our ability to simulate the future in our imaginations—can prevent us from indulging the blind replicators in committing the worst, excessive selfish acts. We at least have the mental strength to attend to our long-term selfish interests rather than merely short-term ones. We can recognize the long-term benefits of joining groups of doves, and we can sit down to discuss methods to ensure the success of such groups. We possess sufficient strength to resist our inborn selfish genes. When necessary, we can also resist selfish memes instilled in our minds. We can even deliberate on how to consciously cultivate pure, selfless altruism—a form of altruism with no place in nature and unprecedented in the entire history of the world. We were built as gene machines and nurtured as meme machines, yet we have the strength to oppose our creators. In this world, only we humans can rebel against the tyranny of selfish replicators."  

In fact, Thomas Huxley, a staunch advocate of Darwinism, once alluded to similar ideas more subtly: "The greatest sorrow in life is that beautiful imaginations are often crushed by ugly facts. My aim is to align my desires with facts, not to force facts to conform to my desires. In scientific work, those unwilling to take even one step beyond facts rarely understand them."

Though Dawkins' and Huxley's words are both inspiring and encouraging toward virtue, [they cannot evade a fundamental question: If humans are innately selfish, and the ultimate pursuit instilled in individuals by human genes is self-interest, what reason do we have to oppose the "tyranny" of genes?]  

While subsequent chapters of this book will demonstrate that some inferences of the selfish gene theory are incorrect, the negative impact of *The Selfish Gene* remains significant to this day. Its influence has permeated politics, economics, culture, and education. This perspective has embedded itself in the subconscious of many, profoundly shaping their judgments and decisions.
