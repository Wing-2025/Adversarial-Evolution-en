# 2.2 Social Darwinism [Optional Reading]  
Herbert Spencer is later known as the father of Social Darwinism. This erudite and long-lived scholar explored nearly all fields, including education, science, and railway industry. He once published a multitude of works with elegant prose, such as *Principles of Psychology*, *First Principles*, *Principles of Sociology*, *Principles of Ethics*, and *The Man versus the State*, and was even hailed as "the Aristotle of the Victorian era." His achievements also earned him a nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902.  

Spencer first borrowed the term "progressive evolution" from developmental biology, gradually replacing Darwin's use of "evolution." The widespread dissemination of the term "theory of progressive evolution" has also given rise to the "illusion" that biological evolution is directional, progressing toward a so-called "higher" form. To better interpret the theory of progressive evolution, Spencer coined additional terms, such as "Survival of the Fittest" and "natural selection favoring the superior." It must be acknowledged that these terms are exceptionally apt, as if simplifying the public's understanding of evolutionary theory in a single phrase.  

Spencer once explained the term "Survival of the Fittest": In society, the incompetent are bound to be poor, those who act rashly will surely face more setbacks, the lazy are destined to go hungry, the diligent should occupy more resources, and the foolish are clearly objects of ridicule. Therefore, Spencer believed that simple government relief policies would have little practical effect on the poor, though what he truly intended to convey seems to be that the free competition driven by "Survival of the Fittest" would stimulate human potential and provide continuous motivation for struggle. On this basis, humanity can achieve better development, becoming more diligent, self-disciplined, kind, rational, and just, thus evolving into a higher form of being.  

We can appreciate Spencer's well-meaning intentions, and there were no major flaws in the theoretical basis or starting point of his ideas. [However, in later social practices, Social Darwinism, which is rooted in an incomplete theory of progressive evolution, has exerted significant negative impacts on human production and life.]()
