# The Most Brilliant "Dimension Ascension" Event in the History of Life—From Unicellular to Multicellular Organisms【★】  
Through Metcalfe's Law, we know that for a group, the greater the number of individuals collaborating, the greater the potential to release Cooperative Dividend. Therefore, life was not content with the smaller-scale cooperative method of endosymbiosis. After billions of years of exploration, under evolutionary pressure, life gradually found a new path—the multicellular mode.

[The evolution from unicellular to multicellular organisms is a milestone in the history of life evolution and a marvel in the history of natural evolution. It actually achieved another Dimension Ascension of life forms based on endosymbiosis.]()  

In the history of natural evolution, there have been at least 6 independent evolutionary processes of unicellular organisms evolving into multicellular forms (some say at least 20): once in animals, twice in two major groups of fungi, and the remaining three times in three major groups of "algae," including green algae (from which plant groups evolved). Researchers generally agree that the advantage of multicellularization lies in the "division of labor and cooperation" among cells of various functional types (Grosberg and Strathmann 2007; Michod 2007). [This phenomenon of convergent evolution, achieving the same result through different means, indicates that this evolutionary direction has enormous advantages.]()  

Among numerous multicellular organisms, the most resplendent event was the great explosion of multicellular animal life around the Cambrian Period.  

### Origin of Multicellular Animals【Optional Reading】  
Currently, it is widely believed that metazoans originated from colonial flagellates. This classical theory of metazoan origin, supported by increasing evidence, is the most widely accepted in contemporary zoology. It was first proposed by Haeckel (1874), revised by Metchnikoff (1887), and revived by Hyman (1940).  

1. **Gastraea Theory**  
Haeckel (Ernst Haeckel, 1834–1919) and Lankester both posited that metazoans originated from ancestors similar to colonial phytoflagellates in the class Flagellata. The main evidence lies in the stages of colony formation, which resemble the stages of embryonic development in metazoans. Haeckel argued that the earliest ancestors of multicellular animals were spherical colonies similar to *Volvox*, with one side invaginated to form the ancestor of multicellular animals. Resembling a gastrula, this hypothetical ancestor, with two germ layers and a blastopore, was termed "gastraea."

The blastula stage of multicellular animal embryonic development closely resembles colonial protozoans (e.g., *Volvox*). This blastula undergoes invagination, where one end of the spherical wall folds into the segmentation cavity to form a gastrula. Based on these observations, Haeckel concluded that multicellular organisms, particularly sponges and cnidarians, evolved from spherical colonial protozoans similar to *Volvox*. During phylogenetic development, invagination of one pole of the spherical colony resulted in the direct ancestor of modern multicellular animals.  

2. **Phagocytella Theory (Stereogastrula or Acoelomula Theory)**  
Metchnikoff observed embryonic development in many low-level multicellular animals and found that gastrulation in some primitive species occurs primarily through immigration rather than invagination. He also noted that certain low-level multicellular animals primarily use phagocytosis for intracellular digestion, with extracellular digestion evolving later. He hypothesized that the earliest multicellular animals engaged in intracellular digestion, and extracellular digestion developed afterward. He proposed that the ancestor of multicellular animals was a colony of unicellular organisms enclosed by a single layer of cells. Individual cells, after ingesting food, migrated into the colony to form the endoderm, resulting in a two-layered animal. Initially solid, it gradually developed a digestive cavity. This hypothetical ancestor was named "phagocytella."  

Some scholars (Barnes, 1987) argue that while *Volvox*-like organisms are considered archetypal colonial flagellate ancestors, these autotrophic organisms with plant-like cells are unlikely to be the ancestors of metazoans. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that choanoflagellate protozoans are more likely the ancestors of metazoans. Choanoflagellates exist both as single cells and colonies.  

3. **Plakula Theory**  
This ancient theory has recently regained attention. Proposed by Otto Bütschli (1883), it posits that primitive metazoans were bilaterally symmetric, two-layered flat organisms called "plakula." Plakula moved, crawled, and fed using cells on their ventral surface. Over time, the dorsal and ventral cell layers separated, forming a hollow structure. The ventral nutritive cells then invaginated to form the digestive cavity, giving rise to the endoderm and ectoderm, thus forming two-layered animals. Plakula resembles the extant flatworm *Trichoplax adhaerens*, leading some scholars to regard *Trichoplax* as evidence for the existence of plakula.  

### Advantages of Multicellular Organisms  
What advantages do multicellular organisms have over unicellular ones? Specifically, they possess numerous advantages, enabling functions unattainable by unicellular organisms alone—such as extracellular digestion, "biting" and "phagocytosing" larger organisms, and grouping to evade predators. In the animal kingdom, this advantage is epitomized by "the big fish eating the small fish," where larger organisms are more likely to prey on smaller ones, with the reverse being far more difficult.  

From a macro perspective, these advantages still manifest in the superiority of the Cooperative Dividend (Law of Cooperative Dividend, 1+1>2)—multiple cells collaborating synergistically achieve greater overall strength than a single cell acting alone. Their capabilities further enhance as collaborating units undergo more specialized division of labor.  

In fact, when multicellular organisms first emerged, they were merely assemblies of cells. Sponges, considered among the most primitive extant multicellular organisms, have simple structures with no distinct tissues, minimal cellular functional differentiation, and lack mouths, digestive cavities, or central nervous systems, as well as organs to perform various functions. By the Ediacaran Period, just before the great explosion of multicellular animals, numerous macroscopic organisms had already appeared.

[However, division of labor represents an advanced stage of cooperation. Only through cooperative division of labor can the full potential of cooperation be unlocked, yielding greater Cooperative Dividend.]() Consequently, later organisms, including animals and plants, evolved organs with distinct divisions of labor.

The true flourishing of multicellular animals (metazoans) would not occur until the Cambrian Period (540–480 million years ago). With the emergence of the mesoderm, during subsequent embryonic development, the three germ layers gave rise to distinct tissues and organs: the ectoderm formed the epidermis and nervous tissue; the endoderm formed the intestinal epithelium and digestive gland epithelium; and the mesoderm formed bones, muscles, blood, lymph, and other tissues. Equipped with bones and muscles derived from the mesoderm, animals could finally "move." They began evolving diverse respiratory, circulatory, motor, endocrine, excretory, and reproductive systems, developing peculiar appearances and complex behaviors. This differentiation eventually gave rise to miraculous organs like the brain, endowing tiny organisms with the capability to manipulate nature and even aspire to conquer the cosmos—something unicellular organisms could neither imagine nor achieve.  

### Disadvantages of Multicellular Organisms  
It is worth noting that despite their many advantages, multicellular organisms are not without drawbacks. For instance, in responding to environmental changes: [unicellular organisms, with their simple structures, adhere to a core principle in software engineering—software with fewer and simpler lines of code is easier to refactor and more adaptable to change.]() Genes are akin to code; to adapt to new environments, unicellular organisms require fewer genetic changes, thus shorter evolutionary distances. A proverb captures this: "A small boat is easier to turn around." To date, the number of extant unicellular organisms on Earth still far exceeds that of multicellular organisms (though the biomass ratio is likely reversed).  

Moreover, even advanced multicellular organisms do not necessarily exhibit显著 adaptive advantages over primitive ones. For example, sponges, the most primitive multicellular organisms, lack various organs and systems, but precisely because they do not require such complex systems and division of labor, they possess robust regenerative abilities—functioning essentially as clusters of cells. With no specialized functions, the loss of any cell does not result in functional deficits. The underlying principle is that species with higher tolerance for disorder (entropy increase) possess greater Robustness (fault tolerance, which can sometimes be considered fitness) in their existence. (Readers familiar with Mr. Wang Dongyue's "Law of Increasing Weakness and Compensatory Strengthening" may reflect on the intrinsic connection between the two.)

### Driving Forces of Adversarial Evolution in Multicellular Organisms

As we have repeatedly noted, the evolutionary pressures of Grabbing and Cooperation are often not isolated; they have been inseparable companions across all periods and dimensions of evolution. Take, for instance, cooperation among cells and the origin of multicellular organisms. Initially, this cooperation emerged precisely to "Cooperate" more effectively in order to "Grab"—by leveraging the strength of group cooperation to defeat isolated individuals one by one, devour them, and seize their material and energy resources. This pattern has permeated the entire course of Adversarial Evolution.  

From this, we derive a fundamentally distinct perspective: Earth's life forms have, in fact, been evolving toward ever-larger scales of cooperation and higher degrees of Cooperation. An intriguing observation here is that microorganisms have inhabited Earth for 3 billion years, and during this extensive period, biological success relied far more on Symbiotic Cooperation than on competitive Grabbing. By contrast, animals and plants have only existed for 600 million years, and the foundations of Traditional Evolutionary Theory are largely derived from the world of animals and plants—Darwin’s primary field of study. It is thus no coincidence that Margulis, in 1996, sharply pointed out: ["Life did not conquer the Earth through combat, but through collaboration," and "Darwin’s notion that evolution is driven by competition is incomplete."]()
