# Intraspecific Cooperation – "More Monks" Does Not Necessarily Mean "Less Porridge"  
In the natural world, close cooperative symbiotic relationships are more commonly observed between different species, often involving species with significantly differing body sizes (though there are rare cases of intraspecific symbiotic parasitism, such as in anglerfish). For species with more consistent ecological niches, similar genetic makeup, no significant complementary relationships, and more intense competition, can cooperative relationships still form? This question lies at the heart of the most heated debates in classical evolutionary theory.  

## Simple Mutual Cooperation  
Let us first examine a type of limited, shallow intraspecific reciprocal cooperation, which I term "simple mutual cooperation."  

### Emperor Penguins  
Emperor penguins are a typical example of "simple mutual cooperation." The Antarctic environment is extremely harsh, and penguins face relentless natural challenges when incubating their chicks. To endure these challenges, emperor penguins huddle tightly together for warmth. By clustering, each penguin reduces the surface area of its body exposed to the elements. All penguins take turns standing on the windward side, collectively achieving a higher survival rate in the cold than individual penguins could alone.

Similar behavior is observed in turtles huddling for warmth. In fact, the natural world abounds with mutually beneficial actions that harm no one. For example, when two fish swim in water, if one swims behind the other at a slight angle, it can harness hydrodynamic benefits from the turbulence created by the leading fish—hence, fish prefer to swim in schools. Similarly, birds migrate in flocks to leverage aerodynamic advantages and reduce energy expenditure. Herbivorous mammals often migrate in groups, likely to reduce their collective surface area and the risk of predation. All these simple mutual cooperation behaviors nearly always enhance the fitness of both the acting individual and others. Since no one incurs losses and there is no room for grabbing, such cooperative relationships are the easiest to establish.

### Limulus (Horseshoe Crab)  
In *Mutual Aid*, Kropotkin also describes intraspecific cooperation in Limulus (horseshoe crabs, descendants of Earth's former dominators, though not true crabs). He writes: "In the West Indies and North America, some land crabs form large groups to migrate to the sea for spawning; each such migration involves coordinated cooperation and mutual aid among them. As for Limulus, I was astonished to witness the extent of assistance these clumsy creatures provide to a companion in need. One crab had fallen onto its back in a corner of the aquarium, its heavy, pot-like carapace preventing it from righting itself, and a metal rod in the corner made the task even harder. Its companions came to the rescue, and I spent an hour observing their efforts. Two arrived first, pushing their trapped companion from below; after great exertion, they finally righted it, but the metal rod hindered their work, causing the crab to fall onto its back again. After several attempts, one of the rescuers went to the depths of the aquarium and brought back two more crabs, which began pushing and lifting their unfortunate companion with fresh energy. We stayed at the aquarium for over two hours, and when we left, we checked the tank again—the rescue efforts were still ongoing!"

Most simple intraspecific mutual cooperation falls under "non-costly altruism"—helping others incurs little to no loss, or only minimal loss, yet significantly enhances the collective fitness of the group. The causes of this phenomenon will be explained in a subsequent chapter, alongside the causes of alarm-calling behavior.  

## Strong Mutual Cooperation – The Fourth Round of Dimension Ascension in Life 【★】  
Beyond "simple mutual cooperation," intraspecific cooperation has also evolved forms of "strong mutual cooperation." Surprisingly, the altruism and self-sacrifice in these forms even surpass interspecific mutual symbiosis. After all, Darwin explicitly noted in *On the Origin of Species* that intraspecific struggle is more intense than interspecific struggle. Yet the following forms of intraspecific mutual cooperation exhibit the opposite trend—high levels of altruism. They are "Superorganismalism," "Tit-for-Tat Mechanism," and "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism." The operational mechanisms of the latter two strategies will be discussed in the next chapter. Here, we focus on the often-celebrated "ant spirit" and the Superorganismalism it represents.  

### Superorganismalism – We Are "One" Organism  

#### The Secret of Ants  
Though unassuming, ants have long been "celebrities" in the animal kingdom. Darwin referred to ants as "one of the most wonderful minute objects in the world, perhaps more wonderful than the human brain." Ants account for 1% of Earth's biomass and 1/3 of its animal biomass (data source uncertain). With over a thousand species, their numbers are so vast that Brazilians claim Brazil belongs to ants, not humans. Humans have existed for only 2–3 million years, while ants have thrived for 120 million years. They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and countless other mass extinctions. Today, there are approximately a quadrillion ants on Earth, with a total weight comparable to that of all humans. Thus, we may have to concede a fact: even now, it is unclear whether humans or ants truly dominate the planet.  

What enables ants to survive for so long and become one of the most abundant groups in the ecosystem? It is closely tied to their high levels of mutual altruism, solidarity, self-sacrifice, and seamless cooperation. Most striking is their "collectivist" spirit of sacrifice. During grassland fires, ant colonies have been observed rolling into the flames as a single ball: the outer ants are scorched and crackle under the heat, yet the innermost ants survive. Had they all scrambled to the center or hesitated, the colony would have perished—a scenario all too familiar in human history.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e87b968-5127-4410-8060-7c556fd888f2" />

Certain Brazilian ants exhibit remarkable self-sacrifice: at night, to protect their nest, some individuals seal the entrance with gravel and perish outside. Though they die by morning, this behavior persists. In honey-pot ant colonies, a caste of worker ants performs no other tasks; they hang motionless from the nest ceiling, their abdomens swollen grotesquely like light bulbs, filled with food. Other workers rely on them as food storage.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e432ca6c-239f-4b92-80ce-45b60cb00a2b" />

Similarly, bees—close relatives of ants and another hymenopteran group—exhibit no less sacrifice. To defend the colony from threats, they may leave their stingers (which release pheromones to recruit others), sacrificing their lives in the process. Why do ants and bees display such high levels of self-sacrifice? Does this selfless altruism contradict the principle of the "selfish gene"? Some invoke kin selection theory to explain hymenopteran social cooperation. I argue this is unnecessary, as kin selection lacks explanatory power for the altruism paradox—a point we will elaborate in the next chapter. A simpler explanation is Superorganismalism: since worker ants cannot reproduce, their genes propagate only through the queen, their "reproductive organ." Their mutual aid resembles a human left hand helping the right hand. Indeed, the entire ant colony can be viewed as a single organism, with each ant as a cell. The colony itself is a superorganism—a colossal beast! Once this is understood, the sacrifice of "limbs" to protect the "body" becomes unremarkable. *Mutual Aid* contains a similar observation:

A colony of social insects constitutes an extended family, with all members typically sharing the same mother. Worker insects rarely, if ever, reproduce and are generally divided into distinct castes, including minor workers, major workers, soldiers, and highly specialized castes such as honeypot ants. Reproductive females are called queens, and reproductive males are sometimes referred to as drones or kings. In more advanced colonies, reproductive females perform no other tasks but excel in the sole function of producing offspring. They rely on workers to provide food and protection, with workers also assuming responsibility for rearing larvae. In certain ant or termite species, the queen transforms into a massive egg-laying factory—her body hundreds of times larger than that of a typical worker, nearly immobile, and barely recognizable as an insect. Constantly attended by workers, she has her daily needs met, including food provision and the continuous transport of her eggs to the communal nursery. Should such an extraordinarily large queen need to leave her chamber, she must be carried by multiple lines of worker ants in a ceremonial procession.  

The social life of ants, bees, or termites exemplifies a higher level of individuality. Food distribution adheres to strict standards, so much so that one might say they share a collective stomach. They communicate through chemical signals—bees, for instance, using their well-known dance language. These methods are so effective that the entire colony operates as a single unit, with its own nervous system and sensory organs. They seem capable of identifying and repelling foreign intruders through selective mechanisms akin to the body’s immune response. Though bees are not warm-blooded, the temperature within the hive is regulated with precision comparable to human body temperature. Finally, and crucially, this analogy extends to reproduction. In social insect colonies, the majority of individuals are sterile workers. The germ line persists only in a minority of reproductive individuals, analogous to the germ cells in our testes and ovaries.  

From a macro-evolutionary perspective, the evolutionary logic of social animals like ants closely resembles the transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms. Their ultimate goal is to establish cooperative division of labor and achieve greater Cooperative Dividend. This convergence in evolution—different paths leading to the same outcome—demonstrates the power of cooperation and division of labor in enhancing generalized fitness. Both processes ultimately result in *Dimension Ascension*.  

### Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism 【★★★】  
How do Hymenoptera insects achieve the superorganismal mechanism? Gene selective expression plays a critical role. Recent research reveals that bee cells can "read" and "write" epigenetic codes. Bees possess a robust DNA methylation system: when larvae are fed royal jelly for an extended period, they develop into queens. Scientists have shown that inhibiting DNA methyltransferase expression by silencing the *Dnmt3* gene produces the same effect as royal jelly feeding. The Dnmt3 protein adds methyl groups to DNA, ultimately determining whether a larva becomes a queen or a worker (see *Genetic Revolution*).

<p align="center">DNA Methylation</p>  

This process mirrors the cell differentiation in multicellular organisms (including humans), where mRNA mediates gene selective expression to produce cells with identical DNA but vastly different physiological functions. Both mechanisms use the same DNA to generate cells or individuals with distinct functions. Additionally, through this selective expression, non-reproductive individuals are deprived of the ability to reproduce—thus implementing the *Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism*.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be58f191-5951-46c1-a40f-4ef8824f490f" /></p>  

The *Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism* is an ingenious strategy for achieving Dimension Ascension, addressing several key challenges: First, within a cooperative group, this mechanism prevents the spread of "lazy" Free-Rider Genes—since all offspring originate from a single maternal lineage, even if Free-Rider Genes mutate, they cannot propagate. Genetic suppression also curbs the "Hypocrisyism" or "Cancerization" of ant societies (concepts elaborated in subsequent chapters). Second, it focuses natural selection on the genes of reproductive individuals, ensuring that evolutionary outcomes align with inherited genomes. Furthermore, in Volvox—a multicellular organism that evolved independently from animals—the first differentiation also produces specialized reproductive and vegetative cells. This is no coincidence: only through such differentiation can Grabbing Genes be prevented from spreading. The naked mole-rat—the only truly eusocial mammal (and perhaps the only eusocial vertebrate)—also relies on the Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism to maintain cooperation. Worker moles lose reproductive capacity, likely inhibited by pheromones in the queen’s urine. The independent evolution of similar mechanisms across disparate branches of the evolutionary tree underscores the critical importance of the Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism to biological group cooperation.

### Eusocial Animals  
As noted, the transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms occurred multiple times independently in evolutionary history. Similarly, eusociality—the organization of a biological group into fertile and sterile castes—has evolved independently multiple times across the animal kingdom. These eusocial species almost universally employ the *Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism* to achieve superorganismal organization. They are nearly all terrestrial, limited to a small number of species, and emerged relatively late in geological time. Yet, these organisms have become remarkably successful on Earth.  

"To our knowledge, there are currently 17 independently evolved animal lineages that form eusocial colonies. Three of these belong to snapping shrimp, inhabiting shallow tropical seas (the only known eusocial marine organisms). Two lineages are wasps, including common examples like hornets, yellow jackets, and paper wasps. Two are bark beetles. Two are African naked mole-rats. The remaining include ants, termites, mud daubers, small carpenter bees, green metallic bees, aphids, and others." (Excerpt from *The Creation* by Edward O. Wilson)  

Beyond Superorganismalism, the other two forms of Strong Mutual Cooperation—Tit-for-Tat Mechanism and Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism—will be explored in the next chapter. All signs indicate that life on Earth is once again poised for a momentous transformation: a new round of *Dimension Ascension*.
