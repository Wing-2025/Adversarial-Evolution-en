# Interspecific Cooperation—"Friends Walk Together for a Lifetime"  
Undeniably, in the animal kingdom, interspecific Grabbingism phenomena far outnumber interspecific cooperative behaviors. Superficially, almost all upstream and downstream relationships in the animal food chain manifest as interspecific Grabbingism. However, this does not mean that only Grabbingism exists between species without any tendency toward mutual cooperation. These cooperative behaviors often stem from altruistic actions between individuals. In fact, humans have long observed various cooperative behaviors between plants and animals, including symbiosis. Perhaps such behaviors are less easily explained by evolutionary theory—explaining Grabbingism is simpler than explaining altruism—so they have not attracted widespread attention. Below, we will first present some common examples, while the underlying causes will be explored step-by-step in subsequent chapters.  

## Biological Symbiosis  
[There are numerous examples of mutualistic symbiosis in the plant and animal kingdoms, and these examples are being gradually discovered as modern scientists deepen their understanding of the life histories of plants and animals.]()  
Let us first present some typical cases.  

### Entomophilous Flowers and Pollinating Insects  
The cooperation between bees and flowers is the most classic example of mutualistic symbiosis: bees obtain food from pollen, while flowers rely on bees for pollination and reproduction. In reality, however, bees are not the only pollinators; many insects—such as wasps, butterflies, moths, ants, and flies—can also pollinate. Many flowers in nature depend on insects as pollination intermediaries; these are known as entomophilous flowers.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa56891-93c9-421c-8323-4948ca9e5735" />  
</p>  

Entomophilous flowers use special scents to attract insects. Different plants emit distinct odors, thus attracting different types of insects—some prefer fragrant scents, others foul ones. Most entomophilous flowers produce nectar, with nectaries distributed across various parts of the flower or developed into specialized organs. Nectar secreted by the flower accumulates at the base or in a unique spur. When nectar is exposed, it attracts beetles, flies, and short-proboscis bees and moths; when deeply hidden within the corolla, it is primarily accessed by long-proboscis butterflies and moths. As insects feed on nectar, pollen grains adhere to their bodies, enabling pollination. Another characteristic of entomophilous flowers is their large, conspicuous size and vibrant, colorful petals. Day-blooming flowers typically display red, yellow, or purple hues, while night-blooming flowers are often pure white, visible only to night-active moths, which assist in pollination. Additionally, the structure of entomophilous flowers often adapts mutually to pollinating insects—factors such as the insect’s size, shape, structure, and behavior are closely related to the flower’s size, structure, and nectary position. For example, the Aristolochia flower features a long floral tube, with pistils and stamens maturing at different times, and nectaries located at the base of the tube.  

### Anemones and Clownfish  
Through natural evolution, clownfish and anemones have established a novel cooperative model: clownfish assume the role of "caretakers" for the slow-moving anemones, while anemones act as "security guards" for the clownfish. Risks pervade natural life, and the clownfish’s vibrant coloration often attracts fatal threats. Anemones are cnidarians, invertebrates widely distributed among shallow-sea corals and rocks, typically colored pink, purple, or light brown. The tentacles of anemones contain toxic stinging cells, deterring many marine animals and providing them with self-defense. However, due to their slow movement, anemones often struggle to find food. Driven by this complementary need, clownfish and anemones have reached a long-term agreement: daily, clownfish bring food to share with anemones; when clownfish face danger, anemones enclose them with their bodies, acting as "protectors."

### Leafcutter Ants and Fungi  
Leafcutter ants, mentioned earlier, are also among Earth’s most successful organisms, with a single colony potentially containing up to 12 million individuals. Beyond intraspecific cooperation, leafcutter ants are also adept at interspecific cooperation, approaching the level of human plant domestication. Let us examine their symbiosis with fungi.  

Leafcutter ants first use their mandibles to shred rotting leaves, mix them with their own excrement, and then pulverize the mixture. Their excrement contains enzymes that decompose proteins and soluble nutrients in the leaves, while the fungi secrete cellulase to digest the leaf fiber. In soil, decomposing a rotting leaf would require various fungi to act gradually, but through the "cooperation" of ants and fungi, this process is accelerated, nutrient cycling is enhanced, and nutrients in the leaves are directly utilized—both parties benefit. These fungi are meticulously tended by the ants, which continuously prune them to prevent spore production, akin to farmers weeding fields to promote robust crop growth, combined with proper irrigation and fertilization to ensure a good harvest. The relationship between leafcutter ants and fungi is equally intimate: as the fungi continuously grow hyphae, the ants use these to sustain the entire colony.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64078c30-8e81-4e41-b3db-6a719eb4b4b8" />  
</p>  

Moreover, these fungi produce a special structure rich in nutrients, which they do not produce in natural ecosystems, providing a bountiful food source for the ant colony. When establishing a new colony, leafcutter ants carry fragments of the fungi, much like farmers saving seeds for the next planting season—closely resembling the advanced human practice of domesticating plants and managing farms. The evolutionary paths of both fungi and leafcutter ants also exhibit typical traces of Adversarial Evolution: leafcutter ants exert selective pressure on the fungi, and the fungi, in turn, exert selective pressure on the leafcutter ants.  

### Cleaner Fish  
*Mutual Aid* records an example: Trivers discussed the peculiar symbiotic phenomenon of cleaner fish. Approximately 50 species—including small fish and shrimp—sustain themselves by removing parasites from larger fish of other species. Larger fish clearly benefit from having their parasites removed, while the cleaner shrimp and fish gain abundant food in return. In many cases, larger fish open their mouths wide, allowing cleaners to swim inside, clean their teeth, and exit through the gills, which are also cleaned in the process. Some argue that cunning larger fish could easily swallow the cleaner after it finishes its work. However, in general, larger fish allow the cleaner to exit unharmed. This is undeniably a valuable altruistic behavior, as larger fish routinely consume small fish and shrimp of the same size as cleaners.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f2022c-49e6-4b23-9a42-57f6f04472c3" />  
</p>  

Cleaner fish have distinct stripes and specialized dances that serve as identifying markers. Larger fish typically do not eat small fish with these stripes or those approaching with such dances. Instead, they remain motionless, as if in a trance, allowing cleaners to freely clean their external and internal surfaces. Driven by the nature of selfish genes, unscrupulous cheaters often exploit this system. Some small fish species mimic cleaners, learning their dances to safely approach larger fish. Once the larger fish enters its expected trance, the cheater does not remove parasites but instead bites off a chunk of the fish’s fin and flees. Despite these disruptions, the relationship between cleaner fish and their client fish remains generally harmonious and stable. The activities of cleaner fish play a crucial role in the daily life of coral reef communities. Each cleaner fish has its own territory, and larger fish have been observed queuing like customers at a barbershop, waiting their turn to be cleaned. This habit of operating in fixed locations likely facilitates the formation of delayed mutual altruism. Larger fish can repeatedly visit the same "barbershop" without needing to search for new cleaners each time, and they clearly perceive this as more beneficial than eating the cleaner. Since most cleaner fish are small, this dynamic is easily understandable. Of course, mimicking cheaters may indirectly harm genuine cleaners by creating pressure that prompts larger fish to eat some striped, dance-performing small fish. By adhering to fixed territories, genuine cleaners ensure that clients can find them while avoiding cheaters.  

### Crocodiles and Plovers  
A symbiotic lifestyle exists between the fearsome Nile crocodile and the petite plover. These small birds often栖息 on Nile sandbars, forming a friendship with crocodiles. Plovers pick insects off crocodiles’ bodies and sometimes enter their mouths to feed on leeches parasitizing the crocodiles’ oral cavities. Intriguingly, if a crocodile accidentally closes its mouth with a plover inside, it does not swallow the bird. The plover gently taps the crocodile’s jaws, prompting it to open its mouth and release the bird. Plovers are highly perceptive birds; at the slightest disturbance, they raise an alarm. Thus, when crocodiles sleep, plovers sometimes act as "sentinels." At the first sign of "danger," the plover’s noise awakens the sleeping crocodile, which can then immediately submerge to avoid impending disaster.

Similarly, in Africa, there is a species of oxpecker that often feeds on parasites in the wounds of rhinos. This behavior benefits the oxpeckers themselves while protecting rhinos from diseases. Many animals that have successfully secured a niche in the harsh natural world have formed alliances with other species—a phenomenon that classical evolutionary theory struggles to explain. All such phenomena can be questioned through the lens of the "Altruism Paradox." In simple terms, the logic of the Altruism Paradox posits: if a crocodile breaks the rules and swallows a plover, it would gain a greater survival advantage over other crocodiles, eventually eliminating cooperative crocodiles, and the plovers would then be driven to extinction. Another example: if a plant species evolves to deceive insects into pollinating it without providing nectar, it would outcompete its cooperative counterparts, leading to the extinction of the pollinating insects that no longer receive nectar. These topics will be explored in detail in the next chapter.  

## The Human Symbiotic and Co-Prosperous Biological Sphere [Optional Reading]  
[If humans are the most successful species on Earth, this distinction cannot be claimed by humans alone, for humans maintain complex symbiotic relationships with numerous other organisms.]  

### Human Exosymbiosis—"I Am Never Truly Alone"  
The earliest species successfully domesticated by humans may have been wolves. As early as the late Paleolithic period, wolves were domesticated, and all modern domestic dogs are descendants of these earliest domesticated wolves. Remains of the first dogs—domesticated wolves—were discovered in Iraq, dating to approximately 12,000–10,000 BCE. Around the same period, goats, sheep, pigs, and cattle were also domesticated. Later, humans domesticated wheat, barley, peas, mung beans, and rye. Over the subsequent millennia, humans domesticated dozens of species. Modern humans have formed symbiotic relationships with these species; humans have long become dependent on them, and many of these species are also dependent on humans.

It may be hard to imagine, but chickens have become one of the most successful species on Earth, with a global population of 20 billion—an average of three chickens per person. Some argue that if humans were to evacuate Earth with only one species, chickens would likely be the top choice. Most animals that reach the top of the food chain through Grabbingism (aggressive resource competition) fare poorly, for the more dominant they become, the fewer predators they face, the larger their populations grow, and the scarcer their food becomes, ultimately leading to intra-species conflict. Though humans sit at the absolute top of the food chain, we did not ascend through Grabbingism. Instead, we domesticated pigs, cattle, and sheep sustainably, feeding them to obtain food. In essence, humans have formed a self-sufficient symbiotic relationship. If humans were to go extinct, the species that have long coevolved with us would face the greatest risk of extinction.  

### Human Endosymbiosis—Am "I" or "We"?  
Let us now examine symbiosis within the human body. Humans, with our strong sense of self, often perceive ourselves as independent, inviolable individuals, even cultivating an arrogance as "the pinnacle of creation." Yet the human "self" is only a fraction of the whole; each normal human individual is, in fact, a symbiotic entity comprising multiple organisms. With advancing science, we are increasingly uncovering the complexity of human endosymbiotic systems. The human body is the result of coevolution between "our own cells" and microorganisms.  

Consider the following data (from online sources, unverified):  
- Number of human cells: 10 trillion  
- Number of symbiotic microorganisms: 100 trillion  
- Human genes: 25,000  
- Symbiotic microbial genes: 2.5 million  

Microorganisms, with their vast numbers and genetic diversity, profoundly influence—even dominate—human fate. Humans are "superorganisms" composed of their own cells and the microorganisms that inhabit them. Parents bequeath us our "first genome," while the over 1,000 species of symbiotic microorganisms that colonize our bodies after birth—particularly in the gut—collectively form our "second genome." Together, these two genomes shape human development, nutrition, metabolism, and immunity. While the first genome is immutable, daily life, environment, and especially dietary habits unconsciously affect the balance of the second genome’s microbial communities, contributing to conditions such as constipation, diarrhea, metabolic syndrome, immune disorders, and neurological abnormalities.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff3b435e-c13c-48e4-b78f-fc38faeba491" /></p>  

Within your mouth, skin, and intestines reside entire microbial communities. These influence how you digest food, train your immune system, and may even affect your emotions and behavior. Who are these tiny "tenants," and how do they reshape our understanding of human health, disease, and identity?  

The human body comprises trillions of cells—specifically, trillions of human cells. It was only in the early 21st century that scientists recognized the body also contains trillions of microbial cells, potentially three times the number of human cells. This is the *human microbiome*: the collection of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and other microbes) living inside and on the human body. This discovery is remarkable, for these microbes have coevolved with humans long before our species emerged, shaping our fate as organisms.  

While scientists knew of certain microorganisms on and within the body after discovering *Escherichia coli*, only recently have we grasped the scale and significance of the human microbiome. Microbial cells in the human microbiome contain up to 2 million genes, whereas human DNA contains only about 22,333 genes. We now understand that the microbiome contributes significantly to human growth, development, and function. Perhaps most familiar is the gut microbiome, which influences digestive health (this is the scientific basis for your daily probiotic yogurt). Beyond digestion, some scientists study links between microbiome composition and central nervous system development, while psychologists explore connections to emotions, learning, and social behavior.  

But what *is* the human microbiome? Some scientists describe it as an "organ" or "part of the immune system"; the union of the human body and microbiome is called a "superorganism" or "ecosystem." These metaphors reflect differing scientific perspectives, shaping both our understanding of the microbiome and related medical practices. For example, some physicians advocate *fecal microbiota transplantation*—swallowing a pill containing another person’s feces to treat gut microbiome dysfunction. This therapy, grounded in the same principles as organ transplantation, stems from viewing the microbiome as a human organ.  

[This is a "collection of organisms" that interact closely, producing functions absent at the level of individual organisms.]() This perspective is compelling because the human body and its microbiome achieve what neither can do alone. For instance, humans cannot extract as much energy from food without microbial assistance; conversely, the microbiome cannot survive without the human host. The superorganism view also emphasizes the coevolutionary history of humans and their microbiome. Since both depend on each other for survival, their evolution has been a mutual response—an instance of *Adversarial Evolution*.  

In fact, complex symbiotic relationships are not unique to humans. Recent research reveals that some insects host up to six symbionts, and nearly all plants and animals harbor diverse symbionts, many of whose functions remain unknown. Further study is needed to unravel these details.
