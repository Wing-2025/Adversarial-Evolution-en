# "I Know You Are There, Yet I Cannot Grasp You"—Why Is Cooperation So Difficult【★★★】  
From an ideal perspective, cooperation brings significant benefits to a population and delivers cooperative dividends to each individual. In contrast, grabbing leads the entire population into grabbing deficits and long - term internal strife, which reduces the fitness of most individuals. From this vantage point, the evolutionary direction of the biological world seems more inclined toward cooperation. However, the beauty of ideals cannot obscure the cruelty of reality, and the actual situation is precisely the opposite. Mutualistic cooperation is extremely difficult to form in nature, and purely altruistic behavior is even rarer. In the past, when evolutionary biologists refuted the view that "nature cannot evolve species with reciprocal altruism and sacrificial spirit," the most compelling evidence against this view was ants and bees. But as we have analyzed earlier, altruistic behavior under the superorganismal mechanism is more akin to the self - interested behavior of the superorganism itself in pursuing benefits and avoiding harm, and it still has an essential difference from altruistic behavior among individuals with different genes. Once we talk about other non - superorganismal species, even biologists find it hard to cite many convincing examples of altruistic behavior. [In fact, as discussed in *The Selfish Gene*, mutual altruistic behavior is extremely rare in the animal kingdom, and even when it occurs, it is quite limited. Why is this the case?]()  

### Proactive Altruism Reduces Individual Fitness  
It is easy to understand why cooperation is generally difficult to form in the biological world. Cooperation implies mutual benefit, and mutual benefit means that one party must take the initiative to engage in altruistic behavior first. In the natural world where survival resources are extremely scarce, proactive altruism is a very risky behavior. Once deceived—if the other party does not reciprocate—the altruist will suffer a loss, and unreciprocated altruistic behavior will significantly reduce the individual's own fitness and competitiveness. In particular, those who gain benefits without reciprocating are precisely its competitors. Consequently, proactive altruists will be more likely to lose the opportunity to pass on their genes, and the "proactive altruism" genes themselves will also be difficult to survive. Without proactive altruism and the inability to take the first generous step, cooperation is hard to fully develop, let alone deep cooperation and division of labor. It is precisely because the foundation of "altruism" is difficult to form in the biological world that cooperation is also difficult to carry out. [What is even more difficult is when "altruistic" individuals face "grabbing" individuals. One "gives," and the other "takes," with the former declining and the latter rising. Even if altruistic genes bring more cooperative dividends to the group, grabbing individuals will mercilessly eliminate them. This is the "Altruism Paradox" that we will discuss in detail in the next chapter.]()  

The results of program simulations also clearly reflect this fact: grabbingism individuals will basically eliminate altruism (unconditional altruism) individuals completely very quickly:

### Altruism Is Prone to Being Deceived and Exploited by Grabbing Individuals  
Ants are widely recognized as the most collectivist and altruistic creatures in the biological world, as we have discussed earlier. They have sufficient "collectivist and selfless" spirit, intending to "burn themselves to illuminate their fellow members." But in reality, what they illuminate may not be their fellow members but their enemies. Their selfless dedication is sometimes exploited by other organisms. *Atemeles pubicollis* and other brood - parasitic insects can induce worker ants to regurgitate food for them. The larvae of a certain type of rove beetle are very popular with a kind of ant, and they will be adopted by the ants and placed in the brood chamber of the ant nest. This is probably because the larvae of this rove beetle can release a pheromone that activates the ants' nurturing behavior. *Atemeles pubicollis* has also gone to great lengths to take advantage of ants, evolving its entire body to look like an ant. But since this allows it to get free food, it is willing to sacrifice a little of its appearance. If ants did not have such extensive altruistic behavior among individuals, they would not be so easily exploited by rove beetles (which can be compared to how kind and trusting people in human society are more likely to be deceived). The exploitation of altruistic behavior by grabbing individuals is a very widespread phenomenon. For example, in the brood - parasitism phenomenon mentioned earlier, the parasites take advantage of the selfless altruistic behavior among kin individuals. Once the altruistic mechanism is exploited and not compensated, and the corresponding preventive mechanisms are not established, the general fitness of the altruists will be greatly reduced, and they may even be eliminated. Ants are relatively lucky, but the hypocrisyism individuals in human society are more harmful. They use moral kidnapping and PUA to turn the good will of humans toward cooperation into an object of consumption, making cooperation even more difficult.  

### Unconditional Altruism Easily Leads to "Bad Money Driving Out Good Money"  
It is also crucial to understand this point. Even if we assume that grabbingism individuals cannot mutate and pure mutual altruism prevails throughout the population, this population still faces significant hidden dangers. Although the cooperative dividend is very powerful, if every individual in a species is a "good - natured person" and unconditionally altruistic, this will also reduce their "general fitness." Why is this the case? This overall decline in fitness does not occur in the present, because each individual can indeed be unreservedly altruistic and cooperate seamlessly. But the problem will arise in the future. Since every individual is unconditionally altruistic, the fitness of all individuals may be averaged out. However, a species cannot reproduce infinitely, and some individuals will inevitably be eliminated. In this case, the eliminated individuals are almost random. At this time, the role of "narrow - sense natural selection" fails. In fact, the probability that gene mutations will lead to lower fitness is far higher than the probability of mutations leading to better fitness. [This kind of unconditional reciprocal egalitarianism will ultimately lead to the overall fitness evolving toward a lower level.]()  

However, this situation almost never actually occurs, because grabbingism individuals will almost certainly emerge, and these grabbingism individuals will quickly eliminate the altruists. Or, the weak group will be eliminated by other stronger groups.  

### Cooperation Has Never Been Easy  
Cooperation has never been an easy task. There is a good saying: for small - scale cooperation, one needs to put aside attitudes and respect each other; for large - scale cooperation, one needs to put aside interests and balance each other; for lifelong cooperation, one needs to put aside personalities and achieve each other. Every cooperative event in the billions - year history of life evolution is very precious. Although there are not many such events, each cooperation has almost brought about a qualitative change in the form and morphology of life. The gravitational pull of grabbing has always existed, and it will seize every possible opportunity to destroy cooperation. As we will gradually discover later, [behind any reciprocal altruistic cooperation phenomenon that can stand the test of time, there must be a mechanism to counter adversarial evolution to protect it.]()  

Cooperation and grabbing are twin brothers. To deeply understand the difficulty of cooperation, one must deeply understand the ease of the evolution of grabbing; to avoid the many problems of grabbing, one must pay a certain price. Cooperation is by no means empty talk, nor can it be achieved simply by knowing the benefits of cooperation. It requires the efforts of multiple parties and the support of the greatest mechanisms. [Any successful and long - lasting cooperative state is not a castle in the air; it must be built on a mechanism to resist the tendency of grabbing to evolve easily.]()  

Although all of this is very difficult, the great creator has indeed achieved it, and in a way much more sophisticated than we can imagine. And humans are an extremely rare, even unique "creation" under this mechanism. Many people believe that the universe is moving toward heat death with increasing entropy—toward death. But the miracle of life and humans tells us that perhaps this is not the only outcome.
