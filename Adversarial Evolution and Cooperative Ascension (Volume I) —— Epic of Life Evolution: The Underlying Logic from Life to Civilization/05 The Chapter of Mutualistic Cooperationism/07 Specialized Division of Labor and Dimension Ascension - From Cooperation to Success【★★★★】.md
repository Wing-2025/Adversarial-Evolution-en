# Professional Division of Labor and Dimension Ascension – From Cooperation to Success【★★★★】  
If human science and technology are miraculously powerful, envied by all, then the foundation of all this relies on the formation of professional division of labor. Only with the establishment of professional division of labor can scientists break free from the constraints of basic survival needs such as daily chores and subsistence, gaining sufficient time and energy to conduct scientific research. Once professional division of labor takes shape, the species enters a fast track of explosive growth in group capabilities. It begins with cooperation among different individuals, followed by the specialization and professionalization of each individual. As repeatedly emphasized in our introduction to the mathematical model of the "cooperative dividend," specialization and professionalization are key to unlocking cooperative dividends. This principle is not only fully manifested in humans but has also occurred multiple times across different dimensions in the history of life evolution. Once cooperation and division of labor among individuals are established, we can consider that this life community has completed "Dimension Ascension." [Dimension Ascension is a long process of qualitative change from quantitative accumulation in Cooperative Ascension.]()  

### Endosymbiotic Phenomenon  
The first critical Dimension Ascension event in the history of life was the endosymbiotic phenomenon, which refers to the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

</p>  
<p align="center">The Russian Doll-like Endosymbiotic Phenomenon</p>  
The endosymbiotic phenomenon, akin to a Russian doll, has manifested in numerous variations. Among these, the integration of archaea with mitochondria and chloroplasts played a decisive role in shaping subsequent life evolution. With deepening research in recent years, the process of archaea-mitochondria integration has become increasingly clear. From every perspective, their union was marvelous, epoch-making, and miraculous.  
<p align="center"><img width="520" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ae41e8-634d-400b-85bc-d8d05d201bc2" />

</p>  
Aided by cooperative dividends, the biomass of eukaryotic individuals increased dramatically, enabling them to easily phagocytose (engulf) prokaryotes. Phagocytosis also laid the foundation for eukaryotic cells to later perform more complex physiological functions.

### The Cambrian Explosion of Multicellular Life  
The next Dimension Ascension event in life occurred around the Cambrian Period (multicellular organisms had already made multiple attempts in different lineages prior to this). This marked a revolutionary phase of transition from single-celled to multicellular animals and the formation of functional differentiation among multicellular organisms.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7566315d-cad3-4482-bd98-52e95c394a83" /></p>  
<p align="center">Dimension Ascension of Algae into Multicellular Life</p>  
This event transformed the face of the biological world, giving rise to numerous fantastical species. It was one of the key driving forces behind the Cambrian Explosion, directly creating the vibrant and diverse plant and animal world of the past 600 million years. The first cells to evolve in the Cambrian were likely specialized digestive cells, forming a more efficient extracellular digestive system.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3d5b37-2d53-44df-a77c-ebd867ccdac8" />  
</p>  
Subsequently, the differentiation of three germ layers emerged, eventually leading to the formation of respiratory, circulatory, motor, endocrine, excretory, and reproductive systems (for more details, refer to the section "Secrets of the Cambrian Explosion"). By this point, the common model of multicellular life was largely established.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe6ba48b-ff8a-46a5-a082-0438eea6b93c" />  
</p>  

### Eusocial Organisms  
After hundreds of millions of years of development, eusocial animals first appeared on Earth. These animals live in large colonies, cooperate closely, and are willing to sacrifice themselves for the group’s interests.  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63864e20-97f8-4806-a600-c327c85d1c18" />  
</p>  
Prior to this, almost all species had individuals with nearly identical structures apart from sexual differences. The emergence of eusocial animals broke this pattern. Within eusocial species, division of labor is realized, and even specialized individuals without reproductive capabilities are formed. Thus, eusocial animal populations achieved another new Dimension Ascension in the history of life—they unite closely to form a "superorganism" with a unified "will." Ant and bee colonies are representative in this regard, as introduced in the section "Superorganismalism."  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/149776ec-440a-43c7-9972-a8b020c203e6" /></p>

<p align="center">Division of Labor in Bees</p>  

In addition, many independently evolved animals have formed eusocial colonies. Among these, three independent lineages belong to snapping shrimp; Hymenoptera includes ants, termites, mud wasps, small carpenter bees, and green metallic bees; and two lineages belong to wasps. Other insects include bark beetles and aphids. Among mammals, there are naked mole-rats, Damaraland mole-rats, and horses. Furthermore, many species do not fully meet the biological criteria for eusociality but exhibit a high degree of cooperation, such as orcas in the dolphin family and primates, including humans. Although humans are not strictly eusocial animals, they possess cooperative advantages that many eusocial animals lack, which will be analyzed in the section "Ant Theocracy vs. Human Philosophy."  

In human society, the characteristics of cooperation are even more pronounced. A central thread in human social development is the continuous enhancement of group cooperation degree. This cooperation manifests both within the species and between species. Every milestone in civilizational progress implies a qualitative leap in cooperation degree, as seen in language, writing, currency, capitalism, market economy, and the information revolution. In this regard, humans are the most cooperative social species in the biological world, maximizing the benefits of cooperative dividends. Through a model distinct from that of ants and bees, humans have effectively achieved "Dimension Ascension" (this topic will be explored in the next chapter). However, humans are also the species most dependent on cooperation. For many species, a single surviving individual can thrive, and a male-female pair can reproduce and lead a fulfilling life. In contrast, human society has developed an extremely detailed division of labor, comparable to that of human body cells. Humans feel isolated and helpless without society, and without industrial products, agricultural goods, and tools produced by others, it is absolutely impossible for one or two individuals to survive.  

### "Dimension Ascension" and "Dimensionality Reduction Attack"  
The phenomenon of Dimension Ascension has been mentioned multiple times earlier but has not been elaborated. With the preceding context, we now provide an in-depth explanation of this critical concept that runs through the entire book. The term "Dimension Ascension" is somewhat influenced by Liu Cixin’s *The Three-Body Problem*. In the novel, higher-dimensional civilizations possess technologies to manipulate the universe’s spacetime from higher dimensions, enabling them to launch "dimensionality reduction attacks" on lower-dimensional civilizations. A classic scene involves a higher-dimensional species called "Singers" deploying a weapon named "two-dimensional foil," compressing the three-dimensional world into a flat plane. This is a sci-fi plot; whether such technologies or higher-dimensional species exist remains unknown. However, the "Dimension Ascension" discussed in this book refers to a completely different concept—one that is easier to understand, definitively exists, and serves as an important indicator for measuring life stages and civilizational levels.  

Upon deeper reflection on the concept of "dimensions," we can discern its underlying patterns. Let us take the three-dimensional space defined by the Cartesian coordinate system as an example. First, imagine a scenario with only the x-axis, containing infinitely many points. Despite their infinity, these are merely points, not lines or planes. Next, consider adding the y-axis. Looking along the y-axis, we observe infinitely many lines extending along the x-axis (each line containing infinitely many points). Adding the z-axis, we then see infinitely many planes parallel to the xy-plane (each plane containing infinitely many lines) when looking along the z-axis.  
<p align="center"><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bee031e8-892e-49ba-8189-00d5d08a62ad" /></p>  

What does four-dimensional space look like? We can imagine that along the fourth coordinate axis t, we would see infinitely many xyz coordinate systems. This is the pattern of dimensions: each higher-dimensional space contains infinitely many lower-dimensional spaces.

In terms of life forms, a similar pattern prevails: each higher-dimensional life form comprises multiple (ranging from thousands to billions of) lower-dimensional life forms. Countless organic molecules form a prokaryote; multiple prokaryotes "assemble" into a eukaryote; multiple eukaryotes "compose" a multicellular organism; and multiple multicellular organisms form a "social organism." Taking human society—a "four-dimensional organism"—as an example, its constituent components are illustrated in the figure below:  
<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/347744d5-4657-4633-804e-9609ebc7e3d7" /></p>  

We may also directly view this hierarchical compositional relationship as a single, colossal living entity, as shown in the following figure:  
<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b048f5-3580-4e1f-8130-9451b6da97da" /></p>  

Whenever life reaches the limits of a dimension—when the cooperation degree can no longer ascend (e.g., when the number of cells in a multicellular organism reaches its maximum)—the role of the Cooperative Dividend enters a bottleneck. Life then "seeks" alternative pathways. [At this juncture, nature has a minuscule probability of "developing" a new mechanism: one that treats the current cooperative life entity as a unit, establishes new forms of cooperation between these units, incorporates Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms, and further amplifies the Cooperative Dividend. This mechanism propels the scale of life's cooperation to a wholly new magnitude—this is life's Dimension Ascension. Thus, Dimension Ascension represents a qualitative transformation in life's Cooperative Ascension.]() The intrinsic driving force behind Dimension Ascension remains life's unrelenting pursuit of the "Cooperative Dividend" and its avoidance of the "Law of Grabbing Deficit."  

Although life forms across dimensions differ vastly—for instance, the ascension from one-dimensional to two-dimensional life involved cooperation between archaea and mitochondria, as well as archaea and chloroplasts; the leap from two-dimensional to three-dimensional life produced multicellular animals and plants, which evolved independently; and the transition from three-dimensional to four-dimensional life saw diverse mechanisms in bees, ants, naked mole-rats, orcas, and humans—all these varied processes ultimately converge into the surging current of life's dimensional ascension.  
<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847ea3d3-9481-44a9-b63a-d81438abadcf" /></p>  
<p align="center">The millennia-long torrent of life's dimensional ascension</p>  

[Moreover, Dimension Ascension incurs costs alongside the Cooperative Dividend, which I term Cooperation Maintenance Cost.]() This cost generally refers to resources and energy expended to prevent internal grabbing and competition. Examples include the immune system in animals and the "administrative costs" of cooperation in human societies. [A prerequisite for Dimension Ascension is that the new mechanism ensures the Cooperative Dividend exceeds the Cooperation Maintenance Cost.]() The "Individual Genetic Suppression Mechanism" mentioned earlier is a typical example of such a mechanism.  

Intriguingly, life forms emerging from this dimensional ascension possess "combat capabilities" incomparable to those of lower-dimensional life. Hence, higher-dimensional life can indeed execute "dimensionality reduction attacks" on lower-dimensional life. Such attacks are familiar: phagocytosis in eukaryotic cells, extracellular digestion in multicellular organisms, and cooperative group hunting in social animals like humans are all bona fide dimensionality reduction techniques. We may summarize [key markers of the transition from Cooperative Ascension to Dimension Ascension: differentiation of individual capabilities, emergence of division of labor, and individual acts of self-sacrifice for the group.]()  
<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a41bd0df-dba5-4d9c-8a08-da28ba06aa5b" /></p>  

Based on these observations, although the term "dimension" as used here deviates from its physical definition, I contend that "Dimension Ascension" vividly and aptly captures this cooperative leap in life's evolution. "Dimension Ascension" will serve as a critical concept in subsequent discussions of this book.  

### The Cooperative Dividend: The Driving Force Behind "Evolution" from Simplicity to Complexity  
Classical evolutionary theory often highlights the trend of life evolving from simplicity to complexity but fails to explain its cause. We may address this through the lenses of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension:  

The evolutionary process, in essence, progresses [from independent individuals to multi-individual cooperation. As the cooperation degree increases, each individual can "entrust" certain functions entirely to others, enabling functional specialization and division of labor among individuals. Specialization and division of labor—processes of increasing complexity—are integral to the "integration" of cooperating individuals into a higher-dimensional life form through Dimension Ascension.]()  

Following division of labor, these cooperating individuals can no longer survive independently. Examples include mitochondria, specialized cells in the human body, and worker ants with distinct roles. To maximize the Cooperative Dividend, they must shed their all-purpose capabilities to focus on specific functions, delegating other life functions to fellow cooperators. When the cooperation degree of such tightly integrated groups reaches a critical threshold, they form a higher-dimensional life form, "emerging" with new skills and attributes. These new life forms then, as individual units, gradually foster cooperation and division of labor at the next dimension, eventually forming even higher-dimensional life.  

From a macroscopic perspective, this process manifests as a transition from simplicity to complexity. This evolutionary trajectory—from the micro to the macro—spans multiple dimensions and traces back to non-living matter: inorganic matter forms organic molecules; organic molecules form amino acids; amino acids form proteins; proteins form prokaryotes; prokaryotes form (via endosymbiosis) eukaryotes; unicellular organisms form multicellular organisms; groups of multicellular organisms form superorganisms (social organisms). This trend of cooperation and division of labor persists, making the Cooperative Dividend the intrinsic driving force behind the transition from simplicity to complexity in the material world. The progression from simplicity to complexity is a macroscopic manifestation of the refinement of cooperative division of labor and an inevitable outcome of Cooperative Ascension.

<p align="center">The Cooperative Dividend drives life's Dimension Ascension, propelling evolution from simplicity to complexity</p>  

Higher-dimensional life communities are, without doubt, the most intricate and sophisticated "machines" known in the universe. These intricate "designs" are nearly all dedicated to sustaining the normal functioning of the higher-dimensional whole. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the evolutionary momentum of Dimension Ascension will persist, [foreshadowing humanity's future.]()  

### Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity and Cross-Dimensional Analogical Thinking  
Fractals, a marvel of nature—particularly in the realm of life—exhibit a remarkable property: self-similarity across different scales.  
<p align="center"><img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd4c1610-6f9c-45e7-9ccd-cdd42602d1f3" /></p>  
<p align="center">Self-similarity in plant leaves and Romanesco broccoli</p>

<p align="center">Typical fractal phenomena in nature</p>  

Fractal self-similarity across scales shapes much of the natural world, especially life. From mountains, rivers, clouds, lightning, and snowflakes to trees, flowers, corals, and many animals, fractal characteristics (or partial fractal traits) are ubiquitous. The macrocosmic universe and the microcosmic atomic world exhibit striking self-similarity. The father of fractal geometry once remarked: "The infinite wonders arise from the endless repetition of simple rules." In Chinese: "Endless wonders spring from the ceaseless repetition of simple rules."  
<p align="center"><img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b091c84a-2f19-4ec3-861d-3380fa396d9d" /></p>  
<p align="center">Artworks simulating natural creation using fractal algorithms</p>  

This wondrous self-similarity also pervades the process of life's Dimension Ascension: each level of macroscopic life comprises the previous level of microscopic life. Before ascending a dimension, life at each level must employ every strategy to resolve cooperation challenges—grabbing, internal strife, cancerization, etc.—or risk descending into a lower-dimensional cycle or even dimensional collapse and extinction.  
<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1079b2f1-6e23-43ba-83fe-738b92b5ae5c" /></p>  
<p align="center">The three red boxes in the figure represent self-similar phenomena across three life scales, each decomposable into the previous dimension's life forms</p>  

Ascending dimensions is arduous; cooperation is never simple. Life often spends hundreds of millions of years iterating through trials and errors, advancing laboriously, before evolving solutions. Yet the cross-dimensional self-similarity of life's laws offers a glimmer of hope—like a天窗 (skylight) opened by nature to aid humanity, struggling in lower dimensions. [Underlying cross-dimensional self-similarity lies a grand, large-scale law spanning multiple orders of magnitude—the "Great Dao." For rivers meandering across dimensions, the Great Dao is the Coriolis effect; for life's Dimension Ascension, the Great Dao is the Cooperative Dividend and the Law of Grabbing Deficit.]()

Since life faces analogous challenges at each stage of Dimension Ascension, cross-dimensional analogical thinking becomes particularly crucial for addressing cooperation-related issues that may arise during the process of dimensional upgrading. This thinking mode involves examining the evolutionary patterns of life forms at one dimension through the lens of evolutionary patterns observed at other dimensions. By doing so, we can draw comparisons between the unknown and the relatively familiar, thereby quickly deriving regular and predictive experiences and inferences.  

This mode of thinking will be frequently employed in subsequent discussions. For instance, when introducing ants earlier, we analogized an ant colony to a "superorganism," where soldier ants function as the superorganism's weaponry, and the queen ant serves as its reproductive organ. Another example is how mRNA-mediated selective gene expression and epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation enable life forms to regulate individual development, achieving evolutionary objectives of cooperative division of labor. Later, we will also discuss that human society, as a higher-dimensional life community, can draw inspiration from evolutionary patterns of life at other dimensions. For example, Hypocrisyists are akin to cancer cells within this life community; the rise and fall of human civilizations exhibit a striking similarity to the life cycles of biological organisms—birth, growth, aging, and death.  

In essence, by mastering Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity and cross-dimensional analogical thinking, we acquire a key of wisdom to explore the profound mysteries of life and societal evolution.
