In the previous chapter, we discussed the chilling Parasitoidism and insidious Brood Parasitism in the animal kingdom; we also touched upon the tense intersexual relationships and even the cruel siblicide among siblings. All these phenomena seem to corroborate the law of "the strong preying on the weak, Survival of the Fittest"; the biological world appears to be a realm where "treachery prevails and baseness triumphs." Is this rampant Grabbingism—the biological strategy of seizing benefits—the sole path of "Progressive Evolution" for the animal kingdom? Is Grabbingism the only way for species to succeed? Are Earth's organisms destined to harm one another in an endless cycle of grabbing? The answer is no. In this chapter, we will begin to explore another survival philosophy in the biological world—Mutualistic Cooperation—and thereby introduce another critical underlying rule in the history of life evolution: the Cooperative Dividend. Driven by this rule, life marches toward new patterns, with phenomena such as Cooperative Ascension and even Dimension Ascension recurring. From prokaryotes to eukaryotes; from multicellular organisms to social organisms, this process has spanned billions of years and crossed dozens of orders of magnitude, unfolding in a spectacular and awe-inspiring manner.  

# Law of Cooperative Dividend – The 1+1>2 Model【★★★】  

### The "Others Are Heaven" Law  

There is a fable: In hell, people are sallow and emaciated, with corpses strewn about; in heaven, people are plump and ruddy-faced. In reality, God treats heaven and hell fairly—their conditions are identical: an abundance of sumptuous delicacies everywhere, but they are only allowed to eat with long spoons. In hell, people desperately try to feed themselves with these long spoons, but due to the spoons' length, they cannot reach their own mouths, and thus starve to death. In heaven, however, a different scene unfolds: people use the long spoons to feed others, each willing to help, and in the end, everyone is well-fed.

</p>  

This small fable contains profound philosophy. The difference between heaven and hell lies in a single thought. This fable vividly illustrates the essence of mutual benefit—division of labor and cooperation, resource integration, and complementary advantages. A simple act of assistance from you can often bring great help to others, and vice versa. Unity and coordination, converging scattered forces into a collective strength to accomplish tasks impossible for individuals alone—this is the power of cooperation. This text refers to the gains from such complementary advantages as "Cooperative Dividend." The situation where others can easily achieve what one would require enormous effort or cannot achieve at all is termed the "Others Are Heaven" Law. We also refer to this strategy of inclining toward cooperation with other individuals as Mutualistic Cooperationism.  

### 1+1>2? – How Cooperative Dividend Is Generated  

Similar to the Law of Grabbing Deficit mentioned in the previous chapter, the Law of Cooperative Dividend is another underlying rule of life evolution. In fact, the existence of "Cooperative Dividend" was recognized long ago. For instance, Adam Smith discussed the mechanism of Cooperative Dividend generation from the perspective of division of labor in *The Wealth of Nations*:  

<p align="center"><img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e4d2d8-a516-4da4-936d-c912c631f11c" /><img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23bd8b02-835b-4ec7-aa48-7d2b5ee8fde7" />  
</p>  

After the emergence of division of labor and cooperation, the amount of work completed by the same number of laborers far exceeds the sum of work completed by individuals working separately. There are three reasons: First, laborers master specialized skills; second, time loss from switching tasks is eliminated; third, the invention of machinery simplifies and reduces labor processes, enabling one person to complete work that previously required many. Adam Smith then provided a brief explanation of these three aspects. First, as laborers master work skills, their work output is bound to increase. With division of labor, each laborer only needs to focus on improving one specific skill, thus significantly enhancing their proficiency. Second, saving time lost from task rotation yields greater benefits than one might initially imagine. Finally, machinery greatly simplifies and reduces labor input. The invention of machinery that simplifies and saves labor also seems to be a result of division of labor. Compared to dividing attention across multiple tasks, human attention focused on a single task is more likely to discover simpler and more convenient methods. For example, the early steam engine required someone to constantly open and close the valve between the boiler and cylinder as the piston moved up and down. Once, a child assigned to this task, out of playfulness, tied the valve handle to another part of the machine with a rope. This accidental act liberated labor from operating the valve. One of the major improvements to the steam engine originated from a playful child. This also shows that many improvements do not necessarily come from the wisdom of professional mechanics; besides specialized modifications, some improvements stem from philosophers or thinkers. Philosophers or thinkers do not create physical objects; their task is to observe all things. Thus, they often connect objects that seem far apart and unrelated on the surface. Therefore, with social progress, philosophy or speculation has also become the main occupation or specialized work of a specific class of people.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21ee830-49dc-4745-a607-fbd95bfa836d" />  
</p>  

Adam Smith also cited an example: He found that in a pin factory, producing one pin required 18 processes. With 10 workers each handling 1–2 processes, the factory produced 48,000 pins daily, averaging 4,800 pins per worker. If workers were to complete all processes independently, none of them could produce even 20 pins in a day.  

<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a767ba-a32b-442c-b9b0-09734abb7a83" />  
</p>  

Through investigations of numerous factories and production processes, Adam Smith developed a profound and unique understanding of division of labor, cooperation, and their dividends. Thus, although the "Cooperative Dividend" discussed in this text is a biological law, it is essentially an economic law. Sometimes, analyzing biological phenomena from economic principles—or more precisely, mathematical principles—makes it easier to grasp their essential nature. Because the potential value created by multiple individuals through division of labor and cooperation far exceeds the value they create independently, I summarize the Law of Cooperative Dividend as the 1+1>2 principle, which is the opposite of the 1+1<2 principle represented by the Law of Grabbing Deficit.  

[The fundamental reason for the generation of Cooperative Dividend lies in the cohesive force produced by the alignment of "goals" among multiple individuals—a force of order, a force of Negative Entropy. Cooperative Dividend is essentially the value brought by orderliness, the controllability and usability of matter and energy resulting from entropy reduction, thereby improving the attainability of macroscopic "purposes." The Cooperative Dividend is an underlying rule of our known universe, supporting billions of years of life evolution. If this meta-law were lost from the meta-universe, there would be no complex life forms, no human society, no human brain, and no wonder of human boundless thinking in this universe.]()  

Groups formed by multiple mutually altruistic individuals will generate significant "Cooperative Dividend." [This dividend enhances the group's survival ability and natural fitness, thereby consolidating and advancing the deepening of cooperation. This process is termed "Cooperative Ascension" in this text. The subsequent "Dimension Ascension" is the result of qualitative change after quantitative accumulation of Cooperative Ascension.]() Additionally, [Cooperative Dividend is not only reflected in "quantitative change" but also in "qualitative change," meaning the whole of cooperation often possesses attributes not found in any of its components.]() This phenomenon is referred to as "emergence" in theories of integrative levels and theories of complex systems, which is also the core concept of these theories. Extracellular digestion and hunting behaviors, to be introduced later, are characteristics "emerging" from complex systems. People have long discovered that simple individual structures and behavioral patterns can "emerge" into complex and "intelligent" group behaviors—for example, the simple behaviors of individual ants enable the entire colony to find the shortest path; cellular automata achieve complex intelligent behaviors of the entire group through simple local rules.  

Keep in mind these two basic concepts: "Cooperative Dividend" and the previously mentioned "Grabbing Deficit." They will serve as the core concepts and fundamental mathematical models of this book, running through its entirety. Like twin brothers, they coexist and are inseparable, yet they are diametrically opposed, heading in opposite directions; the former's 1+1 can far exceed 2, while the latter's 1+1 may lead to annihilation. The former elevates "heaven" through others, while the latter plunges into "hell" because of others. They are the profound driving forces behind the evolution of life and civilization. [After repeated discussions throughout the book, we will ultimately discover that the essence of life and civilization lies in pursuing Cooperative Dividend while striving to avoid Grabbing Deficit.]()  

### The Potential of Cooperation – The Gap Between N and N²

By approaching the problem from a quantitative perspective, we can more readily grasp the immense potential of cooperative dividends embedded in mutualistic cooperation. Suppose three mutual cooperationists, A, B, and C, each possess a unique piece of survival-related knowledge or experience (assumed to be exclusive to each). Through mutual exchange, each individual gains the knowledge of the other two. Consequently, each member acquires 3 units of useful knowledge, and the total knowledge gained by the 3-member group amounts to 3×3=9 units of survival-enhancing knowledge. Extending this logic, in an ideal scenario driven by Mutualistic Cooperationism, an N-member group would accumulate N squared units of knowledge. If knowledge equates to power, this group would thus wield N squared units of strength—a phenomenon encapsulated by Metcalfe’s Law.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1747dfe-efaa-4c8c-bc1d-a0cfb855caf2" /></p>  

In stark contrast, within grabbing-oriented groups, the losses incurred by internal strife (as dictated by the Law of Grabbing Deficit) can cause their total strength to plummet, with the sum often falling far below N. This disparity in strength grows exponentially with group size. For instance, in a population of 1 million, the disparity in collective strength between the two extreme groups would amount to a ratio of 1 million to 1 (in reality, grabbing deficits would make the grabbing group’s strength even smaller). This forms the underlying logic of humanity’s information revolution. However, this calculation assumes zero marginal cost for knowledge sharing, which is not entirely realistic. Even in non-ideal conditions, the strength of cooperative groups still dwarfs that of grabbing groups.  

[Bertrand Russell once made a seemingly absolute statement: "The only thing that can save humanity is cooperation." In my view, this is not an exaggeration—if anything, it understates the truth. For the path to saving life and avoiding heat death may lie solely in continuous Cooperative Ascension.]  

For more cases illustrating cooperative dividends, readers may refer to *Super Cooperators* by Professor Martin A. Nowak and *Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny* by Robert Wright, mentioned in the preface. These scholars explore the profound power of cooperative dividends through biological and social phenomena.  


### Cooperative Success: A Selective Read  

While I generally hold a skeptical view of conventional "success theories," I will now discuss a replicable, sustainable, forward-looking, and genuinely meaningful form of success: *Cooperative Success*.  

#### Unlocking Cooperative Dividends: The Most Successful Business Model  

Modern financial tools—currency, banks, savings, credit, stock markets, and even some financial derivatives—what role do they play in societal progress? Or, more precisely, what value do they create for society? (We will set aside their vulnerabilities and the negative consequences of manipulation for now.) Put simply, their function is "optimal allocation of resources"—directing capital to areas where it can generate higher added value and achieve better input-output ratios. This is intuitive: when ordinary citizens deposit excess funds (value created through their labor) into savings accounts or invest in stocks, professionals channel these funds to enterprises or technological upgrades. This effectively means citizens contribute "labor" to support production or innovation, and the resulting asset appreciation from increased corporate profits serves as a return on this labor. At its core, this is a mutually beneficial process.  

This simple mechanism generates incalculable value and is one of the key factors driving the success of market economies. Its essence lies in cooperative behavior that transcends time and space, with lower marginal costs and lower entry barriers, thereby yielding massive cooperative dividends.  

Consider examples of cooperative dividends enabled by internet technologies: Google and Baidu drastically accelerated information retrieval, enabling knowledge and skills to spread more broadly at lower cost, thus generating significant cooperative dividends. QQ and WeChat reduced communication and knowledge dissemination costs, creating enormous knowledge-based dividends. Alibaba and Taobao succeeded by lowering cooperation costs between buyers and sellers, making business transactions easier and generating substantial cooperative dividends. Shared economy models—be it shared bikes, cars, ride-sharing, parking spot sharing, or secondhand trading—derive their value from cooperative dividends. The explosive growth of China’s internet economy stems fundamentally from its inherent cooperative scale as a populous nation, which unlocks greater potential for cooperative dividends than any other country.  

[Throughout human history, any mechanism or platform that lowers the barriers to cooperation and enhances cooperative efficiency has achieved unexpected and monumental success. The degree to which these mechanisms and platforms unleash the potential of cooperative dividends determines the "ceiling" of their success.]  

[All genuinely meaningful success in business models and technological innovation ultimately stems from successful cooperation and the release of cooperative dividends.]  


### Divergent Paths of Adversarial Evolution: Chaos and Order  

In contrast to Grabbingism discussed in the previous chapter, Mutualistic Cooperationism charts a distinct course: it elevates the fitness of both itself and its collaborators by unlocking cooperative dividends. This fitness enhancement is so significant that it creates an evolutionary pressure and trend—driving life toward higher levels of cooperation, or "Cooperative Ascension." Let us term this evolutionary pressure the "Force of Order."  

While this may sound harmonious and ideal, it faces constant threats from the adversarial evolutionary pressure of Grabbingism—what we may call the "Force of Chaos." As seen in phenomena like parasitoidism, brood parasitism, and intersexual grabbing, given even the slightest opportunity, grabbing strategies will evolve over the vast span of evolutionary history.  

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e7a857c-e502-43c4-b857-22bb8ce1f279" /></p>  

Despite this, we still observe numerous examples of mutualistic cooperation in nature. Notably, in earlier life forms—when energy conversion was less efficient and biological energy more dispersed—Mutualistic Cooperationism was more prevalent than Grabbingism. The explosion of Grabbingism coincided with the Cambrian explosion and the flourishing of the animal kingdom. Even so, throughout subsequent evolution, nature, through its ingenuity, has devised sophisticated mechanisms to transcend the eons-long dominance of Grabbingism in the animal kingdom—a topic we will explore in the next chapter. For now, let us examine the diverse forms of cooperation and how they generate "cooperative dividends."
