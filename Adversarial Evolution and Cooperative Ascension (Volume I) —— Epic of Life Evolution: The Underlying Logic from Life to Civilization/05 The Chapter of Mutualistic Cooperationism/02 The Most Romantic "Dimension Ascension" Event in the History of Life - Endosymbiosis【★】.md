# The Most Romantic "Dimension Ascension" Event in the History of Life—Endosymbiosis【★】  
In the previous section, we dedicated considerable space to explaining how mutualistic cooperation yields significant cooperative dividends in human society. Now, let us return to the main arena of Adversarial Evolution—the biological world—to observe how this underlying logic manifests here.  

The earliest life forms on Earth were prokaryotic single-celled organisms. Their first appearance is recorded in fossils dating back 4 billion years. Prokaryotic cells existed for an extremely long time before eukaryotic cells emerged 1.8 billion years ago. This prompts us to imagine that the ancestor of all eukaryotic cells was a prokaryote. However, transitioning from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells required a dramatic increase in cellular complexity. Eukaryotic cells are powered by specialized organelles that function like batteries. All eukaryotic cells contain an organelle called the mitochondrion, which generates energy for the cell. Plant cells possess an additional organelle called the plastid, which, like a solar battery, harvests energy from sunlight. Chloroplasts are a type of plastid.

How did eukaryotic cells evolve to be so complex? Where did these battery-like organelles originate?  

### A Stunning Hypothesis  
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that plastids and eukaryotic cells did not coexist from the outset; they may even have originated from different species. Eukaryotic cells likely evolved when multiple cells aggregated to form a single cell, beginning to live in a relationship we term symbiosis. The theory explaining this phenomenon is known as the "Endosymbiotic Theory." Endosymbionts are organisms that live inside other organisms. Mitochondria and chloroplasts, as organelles, were likely once free-living prokaryotic cells (chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from cyanobacteria). However, they eventually took up residence within other cells (host cells), possibly entering through phagocytosis.

These internal cells were neither digested nor killed the host cell; instead, they survived and grew together with the host cell. This resembles a "landlord-tenant" relationship: the host cell provides a comfortable, safe habitat, while the organelles "pay rent" by generating energy usable by the host. Such events occurred long ago, and over time, the organelles and host cells co-evolved. Today, neither can survive without the other. Although they function as a single organism, careful observation still reveals evidence of the organelles' past as free-living entities.

In 1905, Konstantin Mereschkowsky first proposed that chloroplasts originated from ancient endosymbionts. In the 1920s, Ivan Wallin extended this idea to mitochondria. These hypotheses were revived by Henry Ris following the discovery that these organelles contain DNA. Later, the endosymbiotic hypothesis was popularized by Lynn Margulis, who, in her 1981 work *Symbiosis in Cell Evolution*, argued that eukaryotic cells arose from communities of interacting individuals. [Subsequent research revealed that endosymbiosis occurred not just once but repeatedly, leading to complex multiple endosymbiotic events.]() For instance, similar to aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria, some eukaryotic cells, after being engulfed by larger eukaryotic cells without being digested, formed symbiotic relationships with their hosts. A striking example is the *Mesodinium rubrum*, a ciliate that can cause red tides like certain algae. During red tides, oxygen in the water is rapidly depleted, threatening marine ecosystems; however, *M. rubrum* need not worry about hypoxia. It harbors symbiotic brown algae, which in turn contain symbiotic red algae, and the red algae host symbiotic cyanobacteria—all of which produce oxygen through photosynthesis.

### An Ancient "Love" Story  
In recent years, accumulating evidence has clarified the process of eukaryotic cell formation. However, this "endo"-symbiosis may not have occurred through "phagocytosis" as previously thought, but rather through "entanglement," transforming the narrative into an ancient "love" miracle. Some recent studies suggest that eukaryotes originated from archaea known as "Asgard archaea." Scientists have identified eukaryote-like genomic features in these archaea; however, due to the inability to isolate Asgard archaea in laboratories, research on their physiological and metabolic functions remains limited, leaving the evolutionary transition from archaea to eukaryotes unclear. A Japanese research team reported the isolation of a pure culture of Asgard archaea, named "Prometheus archaeon MK-D1," from deep-sea sediment after a 12-year effort. MK-D1 is a strictly anaerobic, slow-growing coccus with a diameter of approximately 550 nm, capable of symbiotically degrading various amino acids with other strains. Instead of organelles, MK-D1 cells exhibit long, complex, and peculiar "tentacles" differentiated from the cell membrane. Combining features of pure culture, genomics, and lifestyle, the authors proposed a hypothesis for eukaryotic origin: the "Entanglement-Phagocytosis-Endogeny" model.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/899e22ab-8b11-42d8-acf0-42414ee83cb5" />  
</p>  

Initially, the "ancestors" of Asgard archaea lived in oxygen-free deep seas through synergistic interactions with sulfate-reducing bacteria. Asgard archaea degrade amino acids into short-chain fatty acids and H₂, which they supply to sulfate-reducing bacteria, while the sulfate reducers remove hydrogen that inhibits Asgard growth. As Earth's oxygen levels rose, Asgard archaea urgently required endosymbionts to scavenge oxygen and generate ATP. One day, an Asgard archaeon encountered the ancestor of mitochondria—aerobic bacteria. These two independent life forms, belonging to entirely distinct domains on the evolutionary tree, "fell in love at first sight" and formed an "interdomain partnership." [The Asgard archaeon extended its long "tentacles" to enclose the aerobic bacteria, which were rich in organic nutrients. Unlike other protists that directly digest foreign organisms for nourishment, the Asgard archaeon "protected and nurtured" the aerobic bacteria with remarkable "foresightedness," forming a symbiotic entity.]() The "protected" aerobic bacteria "actively" performed aerobic respiration to scavenge oxygen toxic to the Asgard archaeon, while deriving energy from oxygenated acids produced by the Asgard's amino acid degradation. Over time, ADP/ATP transporters developed within the endosymbiont, forming primitive mitochondria, which eventually evolved into modern eukaryotic cells through prolonged adaptation.

</p>  

Thus, through the Entanglement-Phagocytosis-Endogeny model, the most "romantic" Dimension Ascension event in the history of life unfolded. Two independent genetic entities, belonging to two major branches of the evolutionary tree and distant in kinship across domains, reconnected intimately. Archaea and bacteria merged into a novel species (traditional evolutionary trees struggle to describe this composite species, as it has ancestors from two entirely distinct evolutionary branches). [By complementing each other's strengths and compensating for weaknesses, eukaryotic life retained archaeal characteristics while acquiring bacterial capabilities. The union of these distantly related, functionally distinct life forms was both accidental and inevitable: the greater their differences, the higher their potential for complementarity, and the larger the cooperative dividends generated by division of labor.]() Driven by the Law of Cooperative Dividend, Asgard archaea and mitochondria achieved nearly the most widespread success in the history of life over the subsequent billion years.  

<p align="center"><img width="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e75905f4-7590-4429-a978-00b3b36092d0" /></p>

</p>  

These two independent life forms have "stayed together" across generations, evolving into an inseparable whole. So integrated are they that people have long perceived them as a "single" organism.  

### Mitochondrial Eve

Let me provide an example to help you imagine how extraordinary this phenomenon is. The human body contains approximately 50 trillion cells. Traditional perspectives hold that all these cells belong to the "human" organism—since they are all expressed from the DNA of the original fertilized egg. However, the reality is that the mitochondria in each of our body's cells are not expressed from our own DNA but rather replicated from the maternal mitochondrial DNA. Hence, mitochondrial DNA follows a "maternally inherited, non-paternally transmitted" pattern. Even more remarkably, by tracking mutations in this mitochondrial DNA (using the "molecular clock" method), researchers have deduced that all humans share a common maternal ancestor: a woman who lived around 140,000 years ago, known as "Mitochondrial Eve."  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1636b8-f5d2-46ef-b346-31b69c0166d1" /></p>  

Strictly speaking, all mitochondria are symbionts parasitizing within each cell of our bodies. Does this thought send a shiver down your spine? In reality, they have coexisted with our cells for over a billion years, evolving into the most trustworthy partners bound by shared fortune and misfortune. The endosymbiotic phenomenon is a classic case that challenges our understanding of the selfish gene theory. While genes are inherently selfish—sometimes to the point of individual segments or loci acting self-interestedly (e.g., segment A in a genome may replicate at the expense of segment B)—it is precisely the genes that engage in mutual aid and cooperation that make life truly magnificent and awe-inspiring. Among these cooperative examples, the mutualism between Asgard archaea and mitochondrial ancestors (a type of bacterium) has had the most profound impact.  

### The Dimension Ascension of Life  
When multiple prokaryotes coevolved through symbiosis to form eukaryotes, life underwent a qualitative leap. First, eukaryotes grew significantly larger. Typical prokaryotic cells measure around 1 micrometer, while eukaryotic cells generally range from 10 to 30 micrometers. More complex eukaryotes, such as amoebas and paramecia, can reach 200 to 300 micrometers. Eukaryotic cells are 10 to 1,000 times larger than prokaryotic cells, with their cytoplasm developing a cytoskeleton (a network of protein fibers) that enables internal movement of cellular components. As eukaryotes, they acquired a new ability: "mobility." Most eukaryotic cells can move using flagella, allowing them to "actively" navigate toward environments favorable for survival, whereas prokaryotes have limited autonomous mobility and primarily drift passively.  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be25f85-f829-4351-b689-0d95ce9ee443" /></p>  

Second, eukaryotes universally gained another new "skill": endocytosis. Endocytosis can be divided into phagocytosis (cell "eating") and pinocytosis (cell "drinking"). In protozoa, phagocytosis is a critical method for acquiring nutrients from the external environment. Extracellular materials enter the cell via phagocytosis, are digested in lysosomes, and release small molecules for cellular use. Notably, cooperation among prokaryotes is driven by an evolutionary logic of grabbing—they first unite to form a stronger collective, then compete for material and energy against solitary prokaryotes. This pattern of tight cooperation forged for better resource competition is a fundamental mode of life’s evolution, which we will revisit repeatedly.  

<p align="center"><img width="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b34515f8-fb33-4051-997a-e0e231c564d3" /></p>  
<p align="center">The endocytosis process under a microscope</p>  

In higher organisms, phagocytosis is not merely a nutrient-acquisition mechanism but also a vital means of self-protection and defense. It is closely linked to immune responses, neurotransmitter transport, cell signaling, and metabolic balance in cells and tissues.  

<p align="center"><img width="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e4f015-62f1-4e89-9ebe-66f974fdd8b1" /></p>  

Through endosymbiosis, prokaryotes gradually evolved into eukaryotes, which can be seen as assemblages of multiple prokaryotes. Mitochondria are a prime example: some eukaryotic cells may contain hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria, each with distinct roles and interdependent relationships with the host cell. At this point, "multiple" prokaryotes have merged into a "single" eukaryote—this is no trivial Cooperative Ascension but a true Dimension Ascension of life’s cooperative organization (a concept we will elaborate on later). These organelles, with their diverse functions and complementary advantages (e.g., the union of aerobic and anaerobic organisms), work in unison toward a singular "goal": ensuring the genetic inheritance of this symbiotic life community. Their unified purpose and coordinated actions have granted them enormous advantages in interspecies competition. As we know, eukaryotes that succeeded through endosymbiosis later evolved into the kingdoms of Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia—these form the primary components of the vibrant, visible world around us.
