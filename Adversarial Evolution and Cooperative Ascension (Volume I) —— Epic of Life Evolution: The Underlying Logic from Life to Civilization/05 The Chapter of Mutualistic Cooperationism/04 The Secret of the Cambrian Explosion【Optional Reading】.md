# The Secret of the Cambrian Explosion [Excerpt]  
By this chapter, we have already mastered the theoretical foundation to understand the Cambrian Explosion. We can explore the internal logic of the Cambrian species explosion from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution. Before proceeding, it must be emphasized that this is a conjecture synthesized from known phenomena, which may be one-sided and imprecise. However, it should serve as an answer that, under current known conditions, comes relatively close to the truth of the Cambrian Explosion.  

[From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the Cambrian Period, marked by a revolutionary biological explosion, is an unequivocal milestone and a turning point in the history of life evolution that bridges the past and the future.]()  

Let us now delve into this great revolution in the history of life.  

### The Cambrian Period—A Major "Unsolved Case" in Paleontology and Geology  
Since the origin of life, organisms existed in simple unicellular forms for a lengthy 3 billion years. Then, in the early Cambrian, life seemingly crossed a threshold, as multicellular animals with diverse forms and complex structures suddenly emerged in large numbers, filling the oceans with bizarre and fantastical creatures. The Cambrian also resembled a generous testing ground of the creator, where many species were rapidly created and then swiftly destroyed, with one replacing another.  

The Cambrian began approximately 570 million years ago. However, between roughly 542 million and 530 million years ago, fossils of invertebrates from diverse phyla suddenly appeared in the geological strata. In the short span of a few million years after the start of the Cambrian, a large number of multicellular organisms—including ancestors of nearly all extant animal groups—emerged abruptly. These included over a dozen animal phyla such as sponges, cnidarians, priapulids, lobopods, brachiopods, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates. Yet, almost no ancestral fossils of these animals have been found in older strata. In paleoarchaeology, these "suddenly" appearing diverse biological fossils signify that numerous species "suddenly" emerged on Earth during that period, a phenomenon termed the "Cambrian Explosion" by paleontologists. (This "suddenness" is relative to the Earth’s 4-billion-year evolutionary history.)  

<p align="center">

</p>  

Darwin also mentioned this phenomenon in his *On the Origin of Species*. He was perplexed by it and believed it could be used as a strong counterargument against his theory of evolution. He attributed the "suddenness" of these animal fossils and the absence of Precambrian animal fossils to incomplete geological records or the submersion of older strata in the ocean. He believed that new geological evidence would eventually explain this phenomenon. The view of fossil absence was accepted for a long time thereafter. In 1910, American paleontologist Walcott even proposed adding a "Lipalian interval" between the Cambrian and Precambrian to represent the period lacking stratigraphic and fossil records.  

It was not until 1948 that the renowned American stratigraphic paleontologist Cloud first challenged this gradualist perspective, arguing that the fossil records observed by paleontologists truly reflected changes in geological history. He pointed out that the emergence of various multicellular animals in the Cambrian was as rapid as the geological records suggested. He coined the term "eruptive evolution" to describe this rapid Cambrian evolution. In 1956, the famous German paleontologist Seilacher supported the concept of eruptive evolution, and from then on, the term "Cambrian Explosion" was essentially established.  

In reality, although the Cambrian biological explosion was a "fleeting moment" on the geological scale, it spanned tens of millions of years in absolute time. The Chengjiang Biota discovered in China has yielded numerous fossils of early Cambrian organisms, many of which are "intermediate forms." From the perspective of species evolution, the core question we face is: Why did new species evolve so rapidly during the Cambrian? A more precise phrasing of this question might be: Why was the rate of new species evolution so slow during most other geological periods, making the Cambrian rate appear exceptionally rapid by comparison?  

Scientists have proposed various theories to address this question, which we will not elaborate on here. Instead, we will combine some of these scientific theories with the concept of Adversarial Evolution to explain the Cambrian Explosion and explore its underlying drivers.  

### From Empty Ecological Niches to Adversarial Evolution Equilibrium  
A species explosion often follows a mass extinction (including the Cambrian Explosion, which occurred after several biological mass extinctions). The underlying reason is the vacating of ecological niches, creating space for the evolution of more species—particularly the emergence and maturation of multicellular metazoans, a revolution in the biological world. Prior to this, the biological world was dominated by protists, and the potential ecological niches occupied by protists differ entirely from those occupied by metazoans. For the metazoans that emerged en masse during the Cambrian, all ecological niches were entirely empty, providing the maximum evolutionary space for metazoans on Earth—similar to the phenomenon of adaptive radiation discussed later. Early species could interbreed, leading to the rapid generation of entirely new species.

</p>  

Much of the confusion regarding the Cambrian Explosion stems from the thinking of classical evolutionary theory—namely, that life evolves gradually from aquatic to terrestrial, from lower to higher, and from simple to complex forms. This concept creates the illusion that biological evolution follows a predetermined path, proceeding at a steady pace. In reality, this theory overlooks the dynamic interplay of "biological environments" and organisms themselves through Adversarial Evolution. We can recall the process of Adversarial Evolution discussed in the chapter on Self-Cultivationism. This is a complex, long-term, and dynamic process where each organism shapes its surrounding "biological environment" and is, in turn, shaped by it.

<p align="center">Diagram of Intraspecies Group Adversarial Evolution Relationships</p>  

Once Earth’s ecological niches became filled with organisms, and after tens of millions of years of Adversarial Evolution, the food sources and predators of organisms in each niche stabilized. At this point, we can say that Earth’s biota entered an [Adversarial Evolution equilibrium state](). After tens of millions of years of Adversarial Evolution, if neither (nor any) of the conflicting parties became extinct, it indicates that their adversarial state had reached equilibrium. [Neither side possessed a simple evolutionary path to dominate the other.]() Consequently, new species found it difficult to disrupt this equilibrium and survive through their "infant stage" of imperfection—similar to an optimization function becoming trapped in a local optimum. [Once most organisms in the ecosystem entered local optima, the Adversarial Evolution of species entered a stable phase.]() Thus, the macro-level manifestation was a relatively slower rate of new species emergence. This is why we more accurately state that [the rate of new species emergence during the Adversarial Evolution stable phase appears slower]; it is not that species evolved unusually rapidly during the Cambrian. In reality, the rapid emergence of new species during the Cambrian was normal under conditions of empty ecological niches and an unestablished Adversarial Evolution equilibrium. (Some scholars refer to this phenomenon as the "punctuated equilibrium" theory.)  

Let us consider examples: Why did certain animal groups not appear before the Cambrian but emerged precisely during this period? For instance, why were there no shells before the Cambrian (despite many unicellular organisms having shell-like structures)? Because there were no animals feeding on shelled flesh before the Cambrian. Why were there no anomalocarids before the Cambrian? Because there were no trilobites for anomalocarids to prey on. Why were there no trilobites before the Cambrian? Because, upward, trilobites did not need to evolve spiny carapaces to defend against more advanced predators like anomalocarids; downward, they lacked sufficiently concentrated food sources to sustain their large body sizes (relative to protists).  

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6d2e06f-a9b9-41aa-b30f-3e2a448ca437" />
</p>  

In fact, the transition from the late Ediacaran to the early Cambrian was a process of macrobiota extinction followed by the evolution of small shelly faunas. These phenomena reflect that Adversarial Evolution had not yet entered a relatively stable state. Macrobiota lacked any self-defense mechanisms, exoskeletons, or chitinous shells—making them "giant pancakes" for predatory "animals" that had evolved extracellular consumption capabilities through Adversarial Evolution. Thus, they flourished and perished rapidly, with only those that evolved "shells" surviving.

</p>

It was precisely because species in the early Cambrian had not yet entered a stable phase of Adversarial Evolution that new species emerged in an endless stream, with some quickly eliminated by adversaries arising from Adversarial Evolution. A prominent example is *Hallucigenia*. Measuring approximately 1 centimeter in length, *Hallucigenia* had a tiny head and 7 pairs of robust, obliquely upward-growing spines on its dorsal trunk. They were once the most abundant animals on the planet.
<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c2d99be-820d-4879-a6bd-58f35324592c" style="margin-right: 50px;"/>

</p>
*Hallucigenia* inhabited the oceans during the Cambrian Period, approximately 505 million years ago—a time when animal evolution suddenly accelerated, leading to a surge in species diversity and the emergence of many bizarre forms. Alongside *Hallucigenia*, there were *Microdictyon* and *Fuxianhuia*. However, even though these species were highly adapted to their environment and abundant for a time, many of them became extinct shortly afterward.

</p>

### Sexual Reproduction Facilitates New Species Emergence  
Furthermore, people often overlook the evolutionary speed of hybrid mutations brought about by genetic exchange, as well as the acceleration of evolution driven by Sexual Selection (to be discussed in subsequent chapters). This leads to a psychological underestimation of biological evolutionary speed. In fact, multicellular sexual reproduction (in red algae) first appeared as early as the Stenian Period (1.4–1.2 billion years ago). For multicellular animals, the earliest evidence of sexual reproduction is found in the slender, rope-like organism *Fornicia dorothea* dated to 570 million years ago, just before the Cambrian Period.
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e667e4f-1103-442a-a77f-5709ff11960e" />
</p>
<p align="center">Fossil of *Fornicia dorothea*</p>
For multicellular organisms, Earth provided unprecedentedly vast ecological niches during this period. Thus, for Cambrian life forms that had mastered sexual reproduction, the Cambrian Explosion became nearly unparalleled in scale.

### The Essence of the Cambrian Period—A Period of Ascension and Trial for Unicellular Life  

#### The Explosion of Multicellular Cooperative Animals  
It is generally believed that Earth has experienced five major mass extinction events. The Ediacaran extinction pales in comparison to these later events. However, the Cambrian Explosion following the Ediacaran Period was even more thorough and dramatic than the post-extinction radiations of these larger-scale events. This might lead some to question the earlier theory that mass extinctions disrupt existing Adversarial Evolutionary states, vacating ecological niches and facilitating the emergence of new species.
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12ce07f8-85a1-42af-aa89-0283da941ad7" /></p>
<p align="center">The Five Major Mass Extinction Events</p>
In reality, the unparalleled Cambrian Explosion stems from more than this. More precisely, the Cambrian Explosion was an "animal" explosion; even more precisely, it was an explosion of metazoan (multicellular) animals; and most precisely, it was an explosion of *multicellular cooperative animals*. This explosion was premised on the prosperity of primary producers and the high concentration of biological energy. Driven by the forces of group competition, life on Earth witnessed, following endosymbiosis, the largest-scale "Dimension Ascension" event in billions of years—one that remains unmatched to this day. The flourishing of multicellular metazoans, marked by the transition from simple cellular aggregation to complex specialization and division of labor, was completed around the Cambrian Period. This was a revolution in life’s cooperative forms and a Dimension Ascension in life’s structure. Multicellular animals exerted a "dimensionality-diminishing" impact on pre-existing unicellular organisms and protozoans. Most of the macroscopic organisms that proliferated in the Ediacaran Period became extinct; these simple multicellular animals, lacking cellular differentiation and specialization, represented a transitional state in intercellular cooperation.

#### Extracellular Digestion—A Pioneering Feat of Multicellular Cooperation  
The first groundbreaking achievement of cellular cooperation was likely "extracellular digestion." Digestion is an exceptionally efficient means of extracting matter and energy. Before the Cambrian, unicellular protozoans primarily relied on intracellular digestion, which is limited in efficiency and restricted to engulfing organisms much smaller than themselves.
<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f74620b-447b-466b-9374-3ad5de5faaef" />
</p>
Driven by the Adversarial Evolutionary trend toward maximizing extraction efficiency, multicellular cooperative structures for extracellular digestion evolved—an archetypal case of Cooperative Ascension in life’s history. [From this example, we can observe that when life first completes dimensional ascension, it often evolves organs that benefit collective resource-grabbing. Dimensional ascension initially serves to enhance competitive advantage in the next dimension, and when such competition becomes unregulated, mutual resource-grabbing becomes the norm. Only after aeons of refinement do these resource-grabbing organs gradually degenerate, paving the way for cooperation in the next dimension—though this would unfold hundreds of millions of years later.]()  
Mesozoans may represent early models of multicellular extracellular digestion, with *Dicyema* and *Orthonectida* as their representatives. However, this model was not particularly successful: modern mesozoans mostly adopt parasitic life cycles, with limited species diversity and abundance.
<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cc79c5b-764e-4d49-b51f-dade5ea8efec" />
</p>
As multicellular organisms evolved, they developed a more efficient model of extracellular digestion. Their oocytes underwent cleavage to form a blastocoel, eventually developing into a gastrula. One end of the blastula folded inward, transforming the single-layered hollow sphere into a "bottle" composed of two cellular layers. The appearance of the gastrula brought profound changes: embryos now had distinct inner and outer layers, which developed into the endoderm and ectoderm, respectively. These animals are thus termed diploblastic animals. The invaginated "bottle core" (archenteron) eventually developed into the digestive tract, while the "bottle mouth" (blastopore) served as the opening for food intake and waste expulsion.
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24178139-37b0-46c5-85b3-0141b343e91b" />
</p>

</p>
With the emergence of the gastrula, the advantages of multicellular animals gradually became apparent. They could engulf larger prey and digest it using hydrolytic enzymes. Although their digestive systems were primitive—possessing only a single opening for both ingestion and excretion—digestion and absorption no longer relied on individual cells acting alone. Instead, specialized cells within the digestive cavity worked collectively. The earliest diploblastic animals were cnidarians (formerly coelenterates). Large zooplankton, which had eluded the sponges and "pancake-like" organisms of the Ediacaran Period, became prey for these nascent cnidarians.
<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85318e51-f3b2-45c9-b172-afd1f0033cc5" />
</p>

#### The Emergence of Triploblastic Animals  
Diploblastic animals, with their primitive muscular tissues, adopted sedentary lifestyles or drifted passively with ocean currents. Their mouths and digestive cavities aligned with Earth’s gravitational axis, creating a natural oral-aboral axis. Along this axis, an infinite number of planes could divide the animal into symmetrical halves—a form of symmetry known as radial symmetry.
<p align="center"><img width="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3310d88c-d789-4714-b7e7-3db9485c2cfd" />
</p>
Over time, the evolutionary drive for resource-grabbing intensified. Organisms were no longer content with passive resource acquisition; they sought to actively hunt for efficiency. Through various evolutionary experiments, the mesoderm emerged. In subsequent embryonic development, the three germ layers gave rise to distinct tissues and organs: the ectoderm formed the epidermis and nervous system, the endoderm developed into the intestinal epithelium and digestive gland epithelium, and the mesoderm gave rise to bones, muscles, blood, lymph, and other tissues. The advent of the mesoderm opened infinite possibilities for animal evolution. Animals began to evolve diverse respiratory, circulatory, motor, endocrine, excretory, and reproductive systems, adopting bizarre appearances and exhibiting complex behaviors.
<p align="center"><img width="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f89f657-f603-4592-b5fb-cf4448a089a6" />
</p>
<p align="center">Formation of the Mesoderm</p>

These seemingly simple animals represent a breakthrough in evolutionary history: they possessed rudimentary nervous and muscular systems, enabling them to react to external stimuli with movement. The further development and collaboration of the nervous system and muscle cells endowed cnidarians with the strongest motility of their time. They could crawl slowly across the seabed, inchworm-like undulations, or somersault. Some cnidarians developed new lifestyles: they expanded their bodies, drifting in ocean currents, and rhythmically contracted muscles to maintain balance. The earliest jellyfish emerged, and their descendants continue to drift in the oceans even 600 million years later.  

Jellyfish drifting in the waves may appear as translucent gelatinous masses, but upon closer inspection, some exhibit distinct behavioral differences. No longer passively capturing small organisms carried to their tentacles by currents, these active swimmers envelop similarly sized jellyfish whole upon encounter, digesting them slowly—these are ctenophores, which evolved the first feeding mechanism of ingestion. The enhanced coordination of their muscular and nervous systems allowed ctenophores to actively pursue prey rather than drift. Other jellyfish began to face mass predation.  

<p align="center"><img width="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79430da-7656-4f99-a97f-b66580367f59" />
</p>  

The macroscopic organisms of the Ediacaran biota likely provided the initial "capital" for these diploblastic animals to evolve into triploblastic animals—without the energy concentration from these primary consumers, the energy expenditure required for animal motility would have been unprofitable. It was precisely this more concentrated energy source that created the "need" for the functional and structural adaptations required for active motility in metazoans. Structures better suited for active movement, such as the mesoderm, muscles, and nerves, evolved sequentially. Before the Cambrian, most marine organisms were passive drifters; even those with motility organs (e.g., the flagella of protozoans) had highly limited mobility.  

<p align="center"><img width="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ad5e62-e6f1-40aa-82b3-f7a5c86d759c" />
</p>  
<p align="center">Protozoa—single-celled flagellates</p>  

Cambrian animals truly "came to life." Multicellular organisms of the Cambrian evolved three germ layers, and structures and organs specialized for "grabbing"—including muscles and nerves—formed accordingly. These highly specialized, differentiated cells and tissues finally actualized the advantages of multicellular cooperation.  

### Bilaterally Symmetric Animals  

For triploblastic animals, the development of a robust muscle layer transformed motility into active crawling and swimming. Primitive flatworms flattened their bodies, allowing internal organs to spread under gravity, with muscles and viscera aligned along the body's central axis, perpendicular to Earth's gravitational pull. A new form of symmetry—bilateral symmetry—emerged. Along the body's central axis, only one plane of symmetry divides the animal into left and right halves. Over time, bilateral symmetry became the dominant configuration in the animal kingdom (excluding a few echinoderms) due to its numerous advantages.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d62ae75a-19a8-4374-a638-aa3640901107" />
</p>  
<p align="center">The emergence of bilaterally symmetric animals</p>  

These unassuming worms were giants in evolutionary history: they possessed an unparalleled feature—bilateral symmetry. Their bodies had distinct anterior and posterior ends (though no defined head), with muscles aligned along the central axis, enabling directional movement. Though lacking eyes or a brain, their nervous systems were sufficient to distinguish food from sand. When crawling onto *Dickinsonia*, they everted their digestive systems, dissolving prey with digestive juices and sucking out nutrients. The unfortunate *Dickinsonia*, despite growing up to 1 meter in length, had no motility and existed as little more than a large "meat patty," defenseless against worm predation.

</p>  
<p align="center">Worm fossils from ~555-million-year-old Ediacaran sediments discovered in Australia</p>  

### Chordates  

In the early Cambrian, a subset of deuterostomes developed specialized vacuole-filled cells in their mesoderm, forming a rod-like structure spanning the body, encased in a fibrous sheath. This resilient, elastic rod—the notochord—allowed animals to undulate their bodies by contracting muscles to bend the notochord, then relaxing to let it spring back, generating continuous motility. Adjusting muscle tension enabled sudden acceleration and burrowing into sand. Equipped with this elastic body plan, chordates carved a small niche in the hypercompetitive Cambrian oceans. They navigated the edges of predatory jaws, quietly refining their bodies, biding their time for their own epoch.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b5b1f2-ed09-4672-8cd2-8a4403ff9bda" />
</p>  
<p align="center">*Maotianshan shales worm* (a potential early chordate)</p>  

Around the dawn of the Cambrian, multicellular cooperative species emerged and radiated, evolving from macroscopic simplicity to complex specialization. Their shared goal: to more effectively extract matter and energy from other organisms. As they evolved step-by-step, energy concentrated hierarchically, filling empty ecological niches. This almost inevitably precipitated the era of the Cambrian Explosion.  

### What Unfolded Behind the Cambrian?  

Finally, let us contextualize the causes and consequences of the Cambrian Explosion. As previously noted, the proliferation of Grabbingist species hinges on the concentration of producers (the "grabbed"). If producers are sparsely distributed, the energy gained per unit area through grabbing is insufficient to sustain multicellular Grabbingist organisms, which thus cannot thrive. This phenomenon can be simulated computationally: only when resource carrying capacity per unit area exceeds a threshold does Grabbingism become an evolutionarily successful strategy. Prior to this, Self-Cultivationism dominates—with populations too sparse, the energy and resources invested in grabbing organs (e.g., extracellular digestion, limbs, muscles) are unprofitable, as lifetime gains from grabbing are minimal.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b3bb11-b83e-4ead-bd61-08dea6bf7682" /></p>  

Though microscopic ancestors of eukaryotic algae appeared ~1 billion years ago, studies indicate that macroscopic eukaryotic algae (including green algae) only attained ecological dominance in the oceans ~700–600 million years ago, becoming primary producers. Scientists from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS, collaborating with Shandong University of Science and Technology, discovered an algal fossil biota ~1–0.72 billion years old in Shandong. Their analysis suggests algae likely played critical ecological roles globally during this period. These findings were published in the SCI journal *Precambrian Research*.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffa12046-7005-461b-b045-08bbee4f2bdb" /></p>  

The flourishing of these primary producers had two key impacts: first, increasing atmospheric oxygen levels; second, creating space for more advanced Grabbingist strategies. Single-celled protozoans—flagellates, ciliates, *Vorticella*, *Stentor*—lacked the efficiency to exploit increasingly large, unwieldy macroscopic prey. Thus, under favorable conditions and driven by grabbing pressures, multicellular animals evolved. This is a common and fascinating pattern: the primary purpose of multicellular cooperation is often to better protect oneself or grab from non-cooperative organisms.  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8446a02a-bf66-40ac-891b-b9c08f8ef1e4" /></p>  

Notably, global glaciations profoundly influenced the evolution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The Cryogenian period preceding the Ediacaran saw the "Snowball Earth" event. Glaciations serve multiple roles (we will later see that human prosperity is deeply linked to post-glacial conditions), including clearing ecological niches, which provided expanded evolutionary space for Ediacaran macroscopic organisms, accumulating genetic and material foundations for the subsequent Cambrian Explosion. First came Ediacaran soft-bodied macroscopic animals, likely beginning with immobile filter-feeders like *Charnia* and *Tribrachidium*. Though multicellular eukaryotes, these organisms had relatively simple internal structures, lacking organ differentiation. They represented a transitional phase of cellular cooperation. Even so, their filter-feeding efficiency surpassed that of non-cooperative single-celled phagotrophs.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dd99d05-89ff-4475-9d12-f687ad88215d" /></p>  

Later, *Dickinsonia* emerged, a form closer to true animals. Researchers used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to extract hydrocarbon biomarkers—molecular fossils of lipids and other biological compounds—from *Dickinsonia* fossils, detecting high concentrations of cholesterol (93% abundance), far exceeding the 11% in surrounding sediments. Since cholesterol is exclusively produced by animals, this constitutes the strongest evidence that *Dickinsonia* should be classified as an animal.

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acbccfe8-e02d-42e9-a111-36151a46547c" /></p>  
Subsequently, these soft-bodied animals suffered heavy casualties in the face of "natural predators" shaped by Adversarial Evolution. Those that persisted into the Cambrian were primarily small shelly fossil faunas. These faunas exhibit at least 6-8 morphological features similar to the tubular fossils from the late Ediacaran Period, [indicating the continuity of evolution among biomineralizing animals during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition.]()  

Following the onset of the Cambrian, with the emergence of "animal" characteristics such as mesoderm, bilateral symmetry, and notochord, the process of multicellular division of labor and cooperation truly began. It was then that Grabbingist multicellular animals first achieved prosperity in Earth's evolutionary history, opening a new chapter in the planet's biological narrative. From a macroscopic perspective, an unprecedented and unrepeated number of new species emerged within a remarkably short span of time.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3cbc4b5-d58a-434e-9772-bbe27a4e7987" /></p>  

Finally, we can essentially piece together the causes and consequences of the entire Cambrian Explosion:  

<p align="center"><img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/688c872d-efbc-4bf4-837c-5dfcf671e3f7" /></p>  

From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the Cambrian Explosion was no miracle, nor can it be used to disprove evolutionary theory. Superficially, the "evolution" from unicellular to multicellular organisms appears to have taken a lengthy 1+ billion years, only to suddenly succeed and give rise to a profusion of species. In reality, more accurately, the Cambrian Explosion was akin to a multicellular life mode "waiting" for over a billion years. As producers became abundant, oxygen levels sufficient, and the external environment matured, the conditions for Adversarial Evolution were finally met. Driven by the evolutionary force of Grabbingism, multicellular life then emerged.  

Every instance of life achieving Cooperative Ascension and thus Dimension Ascension represents a glorious moment in both the history of life and the cosmos. This is a magnificent process, worthy of being called great regardless of whether it is placed within the context of life’s history or cosmic history. In the next chapter, we will explore another "Dimension Ascension" in the annals of life.  

The transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms also signifies our entry into the main battlefield of evolutionary theory—the animal kingdom, often referred to as the Hobbesian Jungle. Yet even here, we can still find examples of mutual cooperation.
