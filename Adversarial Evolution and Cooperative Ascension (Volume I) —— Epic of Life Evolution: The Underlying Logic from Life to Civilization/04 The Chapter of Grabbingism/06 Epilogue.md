# Epilogue  
Reading the content of this chapter, such as discussions on Parasitoidism and intersexual grabbing, inevitably evokes a sense of unease and chills. I even hesitated to include certain illustrations, like those of the *Cymothoa exigua* (tongue-eating louse). Humans feel an instinctive fear and sincere revulsion toward these diverse grabbing behaviors in the animal kingdom. This is a normal reaction for most people. Yet, this instinctive response is actually quite peculiar—were other creatures to learn of it, they might consider humans the true "aliens," for nearly all animals on this planet adhere to the survival principle of mutual grabbing. The tendency toward grabbing is, in fact, the most natural evolutionary trend in the universe: if you do not grab from others, they will grab from you, and the enemies seeking to grab from you never hesitate for a moment. A species that feels revulsion toward grabbing behavior would likely have been unable to survive from the very beginning.  

[Is this not the underlying logic that compels people to accept such notions as "the law of the jungle" and "a man who does not look out for himself will be doomed by heaven and earth"?]  

Under the dominance of this fundamental evolutionary impetus, humans, like most animals, inherently possess instinctual impulses toward grabbing: taking advantage of others, being lazy and gluttonous, cheating and stealing, robbing by force, and committing crimes are, in principle, the most natural human behaviors, for they are the easiest outcomes of natural selection. Why, then, do humans—the most successful species on Earth—feel revulsion toward these most natural grabbing behaviors? Humans even label these quite natural acts with the stigma of "Evil." What is the secret to human success? These questions will be addressed in subsequent chapters of this book.  

[Whether through Parasitoidism, Brood Parasitism, or grabbing behaviors in the "sex war," grabbists and their targets inevitably engage in Adversarial Evolution. The former devise means to seize the latter’s benefits, while the latter strive to prevent such grabs. In this process, their overall fitness incurs significant deficits.]  

Only by understanding the deficits caused by grabbing can we comprehend why humanity’s Adversarial Evolution later took a different path.  

[The evolutionary momentum of grabbing is extremely powerful, flowing toward lower ground through every crevice, representing the most natural evolutionary direction. Grasping this allows us to understand the origin of "Evil" in human nature; it also enables us to appreciate why the evolutionary path "chosen" by humanity later proved so arduous, unique, rare—or even, one might say, so "great."]
