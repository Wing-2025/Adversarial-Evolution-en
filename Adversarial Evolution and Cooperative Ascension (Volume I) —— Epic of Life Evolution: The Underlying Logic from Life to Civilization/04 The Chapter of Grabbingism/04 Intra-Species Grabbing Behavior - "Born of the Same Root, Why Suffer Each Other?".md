# Intraspecific Grabbing Behaviors—"Born of the Same Root, Why Fry Each Other?"  
Having discussed interspecific grabbing struggles earlier, we now turn to intraspecific grabbing struggles. In Charles Darwin’s words from *On the Origin of Species*, the struggle within the same species is the most intense, far surpassing the intensity of interspecific struggles. This assertion is reasonable: in classical evolutionary theory, the struggle for existence drives species evolution, and competition between species occupying the same ecological niche is often a life-and-death, mutually eliminative process. Additionally, conspecifics share similar material compositions, habits, and life histories; even cannibalism among conspecifics is considered the most "nutritious." Thus, Darwin’s initial conclusion is understandable. However, most observed facts contradict this. For instance, conspecific cannibalism is relatively rare; it occurs only in species under extreme resource scarcity (infanticide is a separate case). In contrast, interspecific predation is ubiquitous. Though less frenzied than interspecific struggles, intraspecific struggles are nonetheless widespread, marked by greater cunning, treachery, and sordidness. Given the pronounced gendered nature of intraspecific struggles, we will categorize them by gender.  

## The Battle of the Sexes【★】  
In studying evolutionary laws, sexual behavior remains an important and intriguing perspective. [For it is the indispensable path for species to perpetuate their genes; no species can afford to be careless about sexual behavior.]() Sigmund Freud even went so far as to posit that "sexual instinctual drives are the inner动力 of all human psychological activities." Owing to the criticality and scarcity of sexual resources, Grabbingism-type genes have gone to great lengths to exploit this opportunity—for regardless of how inferior, crafty, hypocritical, sordid, or even violent an individual’s genes may be, if it secures mating rights and reproduces, its genes will not be immediately eliminated. Moreover, this sexual strategy may be inherited by its offspring and become a winning tactic. The "battle of the sexes" can be divided into same-sex battles and opposite-sex battles. We begin with same-sex battles.  

### Same-Sex Battles—"If Zhuge Liang Exists, Why Must Zhou Yu Exist?"  

#### Sexual Selection  
Here, we first introduce the concept of "Sexual Selection." In many sexually reproducing species, female resources are relatively scarce, granting females the right to choose mates—Sexual Selection. This concept is straightforward: the genes of males favored by females and granted mating rights are more likely to spread widely, while the genes of males "disliked" by females may be rapidly eliminated, even if they are well-adapted to the natural environment. Thus, the direction of Sexual Selection does not necessarily align with狭义 natural selection.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ed3029-76b0-46ce-a1b6-1bb055ada43a" />
</p>  

In the Sexual Selection process of male competition, directional selection for larger body size, powerful weapons, and ornamental traits can trigger an "arms race," leading to extreme sexual characteristics. Among antelopes and their relatives, males with larger horns hold higher status in the population and secure more female mates. Sexual Selection in these species is exceptionally strong. However, if the survival costs of large body size and combat weapons become excessively high, such "upgrades" in sexual traits will be constrained by opposing ecological selection. As Darwin noted, many species have drab-colored females and non-adult males lacking exaggerated displays, indicating that these sexual traits in adult males are ecologically disadvantageous—adapted to Sexual Selection but not to狭义 natural selection.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/660ed3de-ecce-4b2a-8ae2-bccc668f07b3" />
</p>  

Initially, markers of Sexual Selection often align with狭义 natural selection (e.g., larger antlers). Genes favoring larger antlers persist because they accompany the survival advantages of larger antlers. Over time, however, these sexual traits may reduce fitness. A notable example is the Irish elk with its massive antlers—likely driven by extreme Sexual Selection tendencies, it eventually became extinct under the burden of its own traits.  

<p align="center">

</p>  

#### Ritualized Warfare  
This is a common tactic among large mammals competing for mating rights. In polygynous societies such as those of walruses, yaks, monkeys, and chimpanzees, one male monopolizes mating rights with multiple females, and males compete through physical combat to determine who secures these resources. In such cases, males typically evolve larger body size, greater strength, or more robust weapons (at least in appearance). The more intense the struggle, the greater the Grabbing Deficit. Thus, most species have evolved ritualized combat: contests do not end in death but in a clear winner, with some even resorting to posturing and intimidation until one submits.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb691803-3d2e-471c-92c0-91975ca9d68d" />
</p>  

#### Mating Competition  
Same-sex competition takes diverse forms, including not only Sexual Selection and ritualized warfare but also mating competition. Many male birds defend territories to prevent other males from approaching their mates. Males of many frogs, crustaceans, and insects clasp females tightly during mating, preventing other males from accessing them until the female produces fertilizable eggs.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca2f5efe-9015-4e61-929a-579430f41059" />
</p>  

Male competition may persist during and even after mating. In some fruit flies, snakes, and other internally fertilizing animals, male semen forms a plug in the female’s reproductive tract, reducing her attractiveness to other males or her receptivity to further mating (Partridge and Hurst 1998). Despite this, DNA marking studies show that most females in many species mate with males other than their primary partners.  

#### Sperm Competition  
Mating competition manifests in various forms, with Sperm Competition being a particularly common tactic. In many dragonflies, male genitalia are adapted to remove sperm from previous males from the female’s reproductive tract. More commonly, males increase their reproductive chances by producing larger quantities of sperm. This explains why polygynous primates have evolved larger testes than monogamous primates. Sperm precedence—where most of a female’s eggs are fertilized by only one of her mates—occurs in many insects and other species. In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the degree of sperm precedence is determined by genetic variation in females and by male genetic variation in their ability to resist and displace other males’ sperm (Clark and Begun 1998). Sperm competition also explains differences in sperm morphology across species, such as the giant sperm of certain insects. For example, the tiny *Drosophila bifurca*, measuring only 3 mm in length, must produce sperm up to 58 mm long (20 times its body length) to mate successfully.

<p align="center">Sperm of *Drosophila bifurca*</p>  

#### Infanticide  
Infanticide refers to the behavior where a male animal, after gaining access to a female, kills the offspring she has produced with other males. This behavior is widespread across the animal kingdom, occurring in primates, carnivores, rodents, birds, and fish. Solitary carnivores such as lions, tigers, and bears exhibit it prominently; some intelligent marine mammals, including bottlenose dolphins and certain seals, also engage in infanticide. Even humans have documented cases. Researchers such as Dittmar Lukas of the University of Cambridge and Elise Huchard of the French National Center for Scientific Research observed 260 mammalian species and found infanticide in 119 of them.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cdccb38-d50e-4385-bae0-301b64709ec9" />

</p>  

Male rats take this behavior to the extreme. After mating with a female, they become highly aggressive and devour all pups. This aggressive phase lasts three weeks, after which the males suddenly become affectionate and attentive to the pups. However, two months later, they revert to infanticidal behavior. This cycle aligns precisely with the rat’s 21-day gestation period and the two-month timeframe for pups to become independent. Pups outside this window are unlikely to be their own offspring.

</p>  

##### Infanticide by Females

Take, for example, the wattled jacana (*Jacana jacana*), a long-legged waterbird. After the female lays her eggs, she abandons all responsibility, leaving the tasks of incubation and childcare entirely to the male. In this case, infanticide takes a reversed form: idle females will seek opportunities to kill the chicks of other females. Ornithologist Stephen Emlen once witnessed a female jacana ruthlessly tossing chicks about with her beak until they perished. The male jacana, having lost its chicks, will then mate with this infanticidal female, prompting her to lay a new clutch of eggs.  

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/248c32f2-456e-4dcd-a6c1-0c6905b0a679" />
</div>

### Causes of Infanticide  
Infanticidal behavior is attributed to multiple causes. For male animals, the common motive behind killing offspring of other males is clear: similar to other same-sex competitive behaviors, seizing mating rights with females and eliminating their offspring sired by rival males is an effective strategy to secure reproductive genetic benefits. Take monkeys as an example—principles apply broadly across species. The tenure of an alpha male monkey is extremely short, typically around two years. As its physical fitness declines, it will be defeated by more robust males and driven out of the group. Thus, the alpha male must mate with females as soon as possible to propagate its genes.  

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2760546b-b3dc-4c6c-9197-1c39f4678e57" />
</div>  

To the new alpha male, rearing offspring carrying the "old alpha male’s genes" is both meaningless and a waste of resources and time. Only the genes of individuals with higher reproductive success can spread, and infanticide serves as an effective means to increase reproductive rates.  

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c07070-0f07-4728-9c56-79759571eedf" />
</div>  

Infanticide may well be one of the most significant examples of deficit under the *Law of Grabbing Deficit* in same-sex competition. Fortunately, humans universally harbor an innate sense of guilt and revulsion toward this behavior. The question of how humans evolved such a rare (in the animal kingdom) sentiment of "respect for one’s own elders and extending that respect to others’ elders, caring for one’s own children and extending that care to others’ children"—a sentiment that actually reduces individual reproductive success and natural fitness—will be addressed in subsequent chapters.  

### Non-Grabbing Deficit Behaviors  
We observe that grabbing behaviors and their associated deficits do not necessarily occur through overt resource-seizing but may emerge indirectly from unscrupulous competition. This is a critical premise for deeply understanding the concept of grabbing deficits. Notably, not all male behaviors to secure mates result in grabbing deficits. For instance, providing food to the opposite sex, building nests to attract mates, or assisting in rearing offspring do not incur such deficits. Conversely, competitive tactics like sperm competition and infanticide lead to severe grabbing deficits: sperm competition forces species to expend significant material and energy resources on mating; infanticide directly causes a sharp increase in juvenile mortality rates.  

### Adversarial Evolution  
Sexual competition bears profound marks of *Adversarial Evolution*. Many biological traits and functions are clearly not adaptations to narrow sense natural selection but to a biological environment of mutual grabbing—evolved to seize benefits from other males (or the opposite sex) while defending against the loss of one’s own. Without the demands of Adversarial Evolution, dragonflies would not have evolved sperm-removing genitalia; nor would *Drosophila bifurca* produce sperm 20 times their body length for fertilization—a burden too great for their small bodies to bear.  

### Cross-Sex Conflict—"When Will Love and Harm Cease?"  
Male animals competing for the scarce resource of "females" is understandable, but do males and females, who share no direct competitive relationship, also engage in mutual grabbing?  

[Though superficially, males and females should collaborate to reproduce and rear offspring for mutual benefit, widespread mutual grabbing behaviors persist between the sexes.]  

Sexual strategies directed at the opposite sex, though occurring between two individuals, conceal a dilemma akin to the Prisoner’s Dilemma: full cooperation yields significant collective benefits, while mutual exploitation and grabbing result in mutual losses. Consequently, evolution has given rise to a myriad of biological behaviors and sex-specific strategies.  

[It is no exaggeration to say that the Adversarial Evolution reflected in cross-sex conflict is a microcosm of such phenomena across the entire biological world.]  

#### Roots of Sexual Conflict【★】  
From an evolutionary perspective, the root of sexual conflict lies in the "goal" of genes carried by both sexes: to replicate, persist, and spread. Offspring inherit 50% of their genes from each parent (with females contributing more, considering mitochondrial DNA). Thus, both sexes share the goal of maximizing offspring quantity and survival. However, reproduction is easy, but rearing is difficult. The division of rearing responsibilities becomes the root of their conflict.  

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e1974d-fe77-4cc8-b74a-0f5ab33ea445" />
</div>  

The costs of reproductive investment differ between the sexes. Most male sperm provide no food reserves, focusing solely on delivering genes to the egg. At conception, therefore, paternal investment in offspring is less than his fair share (50%). A male can produce millions of tiny sperm daily, whereas eggs are far larger—human eggs are 1 million times the volume of sperm, and ostrich eggs reach a ratio of 1000 trillion. This grants males the latent ability to reproduce with multiple females, producing far more offspring than females, whose reproductive capacity and investment in rearing are limited.  

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b8ecb1e-7ceb-4e9f-84c3-ccdfd2b4c6c8" />
</div>  

<div align="center">Males generally invest far less in gametes than females</div>  

Since all individuals aim to maximize surviving offspring, the less a male invests in each offspring, the more offspring he can produce. The obvious strategy to achieve this is enticing the female mate to invest more than her fair share in each offspring, enabling the male to disengage and reproduce with new mates. While both sexes desire this strategy, females find it harder to execute. Due to their greater investment and limited reproductive capacity, females suffer greater loss if offspring die. Thus, females focus on nurturing a limited number of offspring to maturity rather than seeking new mates.  

Females are not without gain: they need not doubt the genetic relation of their offspring—since offspring are produced by the female, they necessarily carry 50% of her genes (in reality, more, considering mitochondrial and gut microbiota genomes). Certain knowledge of offspring paternity is critical in the biological world: expending time and energy on non-genetically related offspring deprives one’s own genetic lineage of resources, leading to evolutionary elimination. Though organisms may be indifferent to gene replication, their genes latently drive this mission.  

This also explains male "emotional detachment": males are uncertain whether offspring of their mates carry their genes, as female promiscuity is common. For males, investing in seeking new mates and producing more offspring is more cost-effective than rearing offspring. Male detachment further reduces offspring survival rates. Though male genes favor offspring survival, as previously discussed, investing in reproduction is more profitable than rearing. This irresponsibility hinders offspring health, and the unnecessary损耗 to the group stems from males’ drive to maximize genetic benefits. Thus, male irresponsibility is clearly a *grabbing behavior*.  

Because impregnating females is a highly profitable investment for males, they eagerly pursue mating and have evolved diverse organ structures and behaviors to facilitate this process. Females, in turn, have evolved reserved attitudes and physiological structures that make conception more difficult to guard against irresponsible males (another reason: females can extract more benefits from males through such mechanisms, as discussed later). In response, males have evolved deception, pretense, and even coercion to counter these female strategies.  

[In this process of competition and博弈, both sexes incur high costs and significant grabbing deficits under the *Law of Grabbing Deficit*.]  

It must be noted that the narrative of *Grabbingism* aligns closely with the thesis of *The Selfish Gene*. Driven by the evolutionary tendency of grabbing, each organism adversarially evolves various grabbing strategies, and the competition across dimensions among these "selfish" individuals is truly astonishing. The tale of cross-sex grabbing is equally "dramatic."  

#### Male Grabbing【Optional Reading】  
##### Nature’s "Chastity Belts"

The "sexual war" between queen bees and drones is a common phenomenon (drones leave their genitalia inside the queen to prevent her from mating with other drones). Typically, when female animals mate repeatedly, males are destined to be the losing party (queens generally mate with multiple drones and store the sperm). A male that can prevent a female from mating with his competitors will father more of her offspring, and his genes will spread more widely compared to males that cannot prevent promiscuity. Thus, the "chastity belt" represents a universally employed evolutionary innovation!  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58cdbae9-a462-4373-8aef-4e3117f90f2f" />
</p>  

This "chastity belt" strategy is not limited to bees; it is prevalent among bats, mice, nematodes, snakes, spiders, butterflies, fruit flies, guinea pigs, squirrels, and chimpanzees. Most of these animals do not leave their genitalia inside the female but use other forms, such as traditional "plugs," "adhesives," or "glues." For example, many rodents possess a large gland that secretes a strong, elastic plug after mating, which is inserted deep into the female's reproductive tract. The plug left by male house mice is so secure that it can only be removed with a scalpel; attempting to remove it risks tearing the uterine ligaments of the female. In response to such "first-mover" strategies, later males have evolved countermeasures. Take the ghost spider crab (Inachus phalangium), a species protected by sea anemone tentacles. Male crabs produce a special gelatinous substance that seals the semen left by a prior male in a corner of the female's reproductive tract, preventing it from mixing with their own sperm.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b1f5833-9067-4f4a-8ca7-e6a6f4c909dd" />
</p>  

Another example is the dunnock (Prunella modularis), a bird resembling a sparrow dusted with ash. Most male birds, except swans, ducks, and ostriches, lack penises. Mating occurs through rapid contact of the genital openings. Despite this, male dunnocks have a method to remove rival sperm: before mating, they aggressively peck the female's genital area, sometimes causing her to expel sperm left by other males. — Excerpted from *Sexual Conflict*  

<p align="center">

</p>  

### Coercive Behavior (Rape)  
Coercive behavior (rape) is not exclusive to human societies; this direct grabbing of genetic benefits represents an evolutionary predisposition common to males across species. While females generally hold the power of Sexual Selection, male coercive mating can usurp this authority. A study on water striders reveals that males create tiny ripples on the water surface by tapping their legs before mating—ripples imperceptible to humans but often lethal for these insects, as they may attract predatory fish. Males continue tapping until the female submits. Once mated, the male’s position on top of the female increases her vulnerability to predation, highlighting the cruelty of this strategy. Research suggests this coercion evolved in response to the female water strider’s "genital shield"—a controllable flap on her abdomen that allows mating only when she opens it, reclaiming control to trade mating rights for male-provided "benefits" (e.g., food). Confronted with this shield, males escalate their tactics, risking predation to force compliance—a desperate grabbing strategy.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efc3c5a3-d0b4-4b5d-a470-43896aae2df3" />
</p>  

In many species, mating inflicts harm on females. For instance, the genitalia of many male insects are barbed, damaging the female reproductive system and reducing her survival. Male bed bugs pierce the female’s abdominal wall with their genitalia instead of inserting into her reproductive tract. Often, such harm is a byproduct of increased mating or fertilization success, offering no direct benefit to males. The semen of *Drosophila melanogaster* contains toxic proteins that reduce female longevity while defending against rival sperm. These male grabbing behaviors ultimately incur significant Grabbing Deficits for the population, increasing long-term mating difficulties and reproductive costs for males.  

#### Female Grabbing (Optional Reading)  
While females are often smaller and more passive, they too employ grabbing strategies, seizing any opportunity to exploit evolutionary predispositions. Observations of chimpanzee groups reveal that males share hunted meat with estrous females, and females select mates based on this generosity. Scorpionflies exhibit similar behavior: males offer large insects to females in exchange for mating rights.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e45b052-2c6a-4a7d-b881-e71f2b63ac3e" />
</p>  

Many male insects provide "nuptial gifts"—nutrient- and chemical-rich offerings transferred alongside sperm (Gwynne 2008). In the ornate moth (*Utetheisa ornatrix*), these chemicals include alkaloids from larval food, which deter predators and reduce egg predation.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5ff1548-6654-4466-8445-f91792ea6c73" />
</p>  

Extreme examples include "sexual cannibalism" in mantises and spiders, where females consume their mates during copulation to replenish nutrients. This demonstrates how females leverage mating rights to acquire substantial survival resources.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/048c257f-c564-4c6c-b52a-1de1685bb376" />
</p>  

Thus, the optimal female strategy emerges: maximize resource acquisition through mating rights while minimizing immediate pregnancy, deferring conception until sufficient nutrients are accumulated—since each offspring imposes significant costs. This explains a longstanding scientific puzzle: why female animals are "difficult to impregnate," specifically why their reproductive tracts are hostile to sperm. Though sperm and ova depend on one another, reality diverges sharply.  

### Why Is Conception So Difficult? (Optional Reading)  
Take the queen bee: during mating, she receives an average of 102 million sperm but retains only 5.3 million for fertilization. In species without sperm storage, sperm face even greater attrition. Human sperm begin their journey in the acidic environment of the vagina, a lethal obstacle that eliminates over 90% of them. Survivors must navigate the cervical mucus—a barrier that kills over 90% of remaining sperm. The mucus is but one hurdle; the cervix harbors further traps.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db75271-1e9d-42f7-bb86-acd610d88181" />
</p>  

Sperm also confront white blood cells—immune system "soldiers" stationed in the cervix and endometrium, poised to repel invaders. In rabbits, 5.5 million white blood cells gather in the cervix within an hour of mating. In humans, white blood cell counts exceed 1 billion within an hour of intercourse. By the time sperm reach the fallopian tube (where ova reside), their numbers plummet from millions to hundreds. This is why men with 50 million sperm—seemingly ample—may still be infertile. (Excerpted from *Sexual Conflict*)  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679e1cac-28c3-4a34-8a99-a1254f17d362" />
</p>

Since the female's genes also "desire" her own conception—for they too need to be inherited—why does she deliberately increase the difficulty of conception? On one hand, this is the female's way of reclaiming the power of "Sexual Selection"; if females had no choice at all, the species would devolve into a realm dominated by unscrupulous rapists. On the other hand, the difficulty of conception allows female animals to leverage their mating rights to extract greater benefits from males. (I disagree with the traditional theory that difficult conception exists solely to select for higher-quality sperm.)  

To make an imperfect analogy: suppose there are two types of female mantises—one with easy conception, the other with greater difficulty. The former would more likely conceive during a single mating, potentially allowing the male to escape before she can consume him. In contrast, the latter, with greater difficulty in conception, is more likely to consume her mate, gaining more resources. Thus, such mantises with higher conception difficulty would outcompete others in individual competition. This explains why female animals have evolved toward increasing difficulty in conception—though not to the extreme of infertility, which would prevent the "cunning" genes from being passed on. Meanwhile, males have correspondingly evolved genes that enhance their ability to fertilize females, driving this Adversarial Evolution forward in an ongoing game.  

[Similar dynamics occur in human societies. The underlying purpose of most women's promiscuous behavior (not necessarily a conscious plan, but an implicit effect of their actions) is to secure more survival resources from men—by making multiple men perceive her as their mate, she gains "spousal-level" treatment from each, thereby increasing her chances of survival. For instance, Li Wei, a female tycoon who amassed billions, once built a network of connections with multiple provincial and ministerial-level officials—dubbed their "public mistress." Leveraging insider information and political influence, she established nearly 20 companies across Beijing, Qingdao, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and overseas in just a decade, spanning industries like tobacco, real estate, advertising, petroleum, and securities, with related assets totaling nearly 10 billion yuan.]  

While female promiscuity confers significant short-term benefits, it undermines male interests—metaphorically "deceiving" many men's affections. In reality, it appropriates the genetic benefits of men who provide substantial resources or help raise non-biological offspring without receiving reproductive reciprocity. This breeds male suspicion of paternity, indirectly fueling male irresponsibility and igniting chaotic wars between males and between the sexes. For further details on this competition, readers may refer to *The Sex War*.  

### The Devastating Consequences of Sexual Conflict  

What are the outcomes of these sexual wars? Let us examine species that have entered extreme stages of gender conflict. Male stick insects (slender, twig-like insects) exemplify this: to prevent rivals from accessing their mates, they mate for up to ten weeks. Similarly, the Idaho ground squirrel—a rare, burrowing rodent native to Idaho—sees males relentlessly shadowing their mates. If she enters a burrow, he guards the entrance, blocking both her exit and rival males’ entry; he even attacks any male that approaches. [Imagine this scenario in humans—spending most time scheming to poach mates or fending off poachers, leaving little time for productive creation. No wonder such species teeter on the brink of extinction.]  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9774cf8-2ed6-4746-a62b-d951b9c3e345" />

</p>  

Take the sexual cannibalism of female mantises. Adversarial Evolution has not left males passive. Recent studies on the African praying mantis (*Miomantis caffra*) reveal that some males force copulation through aggression, not only completing mating but also surviving. Researchers observed that defeated females sometimes sustain severe abdominal puncture wounds from male forelegs, which later form black scabs. More strikingly, the tiny *Drosophila bifurca*—a fruit fly just 3mm long—produces sperm 58mm in length (20 times its body size). By comparison, human sperm are a thousandth the size of *Drosophila bifurca* sperm; if humans matched this scale, a single sperm would be longer than a blue whale.  

Elsewhere in the animal kingdom, males employ "chastity belts" and sabotage rivals’ belts; they expend massive quantities of sperm or time on mating; they may even invest years rearing unrelated offspring. Females, in turn, endure coercion, injury, and sometimes fatal harm during mating. Evidently, like other forms of Grabbingism, sexual conflict results in profound internal depletion—wasting species’ time and resources on mutual exploitation and defense—greatly diminishing collective survival chances and rendering species vulnerable to extinction by competitors or nature.  

### The Miracle of Human Love  

Contrast this with species that have evolved "fidelity" genes. Many primates mate with only one partner per estrus cycle. Gorillas, for example, have relatively small, simple genitalia—no need for complex structures to counter male rivals—because female fidelity eliminates such competition. Consequently, they allocate more time and physical resources to survival-beneficial behaviors. Among primates, humans have the second-lowest sperm reserve (after gorillas), reflecting our position in a relatively mild sexual conflict—a boon for species prosperity.  

Beyond this, human male-female cooperation surpasses that of any other species. The human spirit of sacrifice and the uniquely biological phenomenon of "love" defy the explanations of *The Selfish Gene*. "Till hills flatten, heaven and earth merge—then shall I part from thee" is a verse only humans can compose; the sentiment of *The Tune of Winter Clothes* is uniquely human:  

*Moonlight fades—who pounds winter clothes?*  
*Gazing afar, longing for you at home.*  
*Overnight, snow clings thin; north wind rages.*  
*A thousand miles apart, hearts remain bound.*  

*Dreams of glory—羌笛 echoes on the frontier.*  
*Wars unprovoked; beacon fires scorch seasons.*  
*Tonight, snow blankets the pass; north wind howls.*  
*A thousand miles apart, hearts remain bound.*  

*Shall we stay together in this life, or cherish in the next?*  
*Why do you never grasp this riddle?*  
*Only in retrospection, the memory lingers.*  

*On the world’s path, a lone shadow—whom to rely on?*  
*Knowing your heart, I send winter clothes across miles.*  
*If I return triumphant, adorned with plumes, homeward bound.*  

*Tonight, frontier sounds surge; urgency mounts.*  
*Blood stains the sand; souls find rest at last.*  

Male responsibility, female fidelity, and this unparalleled, non-grabbing love and devotion are key to humanity’s extraordinary achievements. How humans counter the evolutionary pull of Grabbingism; avoid the "quagmire" of sexual Grabbing Deficit that ensnares countless species; and evolve this most laudable "love" and rarest moral sentiment—these questions will be addressed in subsequent chapters.

## Siblicide: Intraspecific Grabbing  

While "sexual conflict" is a prominent form of intraspecific Grabbingism, it is far from the only one. Intraspecific Grabbingism also pervades sibling relationships, even among blood relatives. Earlier, we mentioned parasitic wasps, which are not only cruel to caterpillars but also to their own kin: within a single caterpillar, larger wasp larvae kill smaller siblings.

Siblicide is routine in certain eagles and boobies. Female eagles typically lay two eggs, but one chick always kills the other (the second egg acts as a "backup" in case the first fails).

Among sharks, this sibling rivalry begins even earlier—in utero. In ovoviviparous species, embryos cannibalize one another in the womb, with the largest emerging victorious.

Does the mention of such acts of sibling rivalry in the animal kingdom evoke images of life-and-death power struggles in royal courts across dynasties, where princes vie for supremacy? "Born of the same root, why must they fry each other so fiercely?" For these top-tier grabbingists, the ability to seize benefits is their survival skill. A species evolving entirely toward a grabbing tendency will generally trend toward fratricide, sibling infighting, abandoning spouses and children, and ultimately becoming isolated loners. Such abilities truly require practice starting from the womb.  

### Is the struggle for existence among individuals of the same species the most intense?  
Darwin, in *On the Origin of Species*, posits: "Struggles among individuals of the same species are almost necessarily the most intense, for they inhabit the same area, require the same resources, and face the same dangers." He cites examples: mixed wheat varieties competing, mountain sheep and their variants unable to coexist, and different leech species kept together resulting in one starving. Intraspecific cannibalism also occurs—for instance, adult perch preying on juveniles of their own species, or males of certain animals engaging in fatal battles over mates during breeding seasons. Does this indicate that intraspecific struggle is more intense than interspecific struggle?  

In reality, intraspecific cannibalism in nature is relatively rare, at least compared to interspecific predation. Many species have evolved ritualized combat to resolve conflicts, avoiding excessive competition. Moreover, among animals ranging from birds to large mammals, territorial, mating, or dominance disputes often take the form of posturing and intimidation; physical confrontations are typically limited, and a fleeing opponent is rarely pursued to the death. From an individual perspective, mating competition benefits species survival—"stronger" individuals secure better resources, and their offspring inherit superior genetic traits.  

From the perspective of absolute evolution, an intense intraspecific grabbing tendency may seem an inevitable evolutionary trend. However, from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the outcome could be entirely reversed. [Since each individual within a species serves as the "survival environment" for others, and they share close genetic relationships, genes possess a degree of operational flexibility. If a gene is "foresighted enough" and "skillful enough," it can avoid the significant deficits caused by intraspecific grabbing and instead establish cooperative relationships.]( ) The Superorganismalism, Tit-for-Tat Mechanism, and Virtue Selection (Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism) Mechanism we will explore later achieve this goal from distinct angles, forging a new evolutionary path in the biological world.
