# Grabbingism – "Better I Betray the World Than the World Betray Me"  

From the preceding stories, we know that predators refer to organisms that plunder material and energy from other living beings. Grabbingism, in turn, refers to such predatory behaviors and survival strategies. It is important to note that the targets of grabbing are energy-rich "life forms"; behaviors that extract material and energy directly from nature do not fall under grabbingism. According to this definition, organisms that obtain material and energy by consuming plants can be considered grabbers, as can higher-level predators that hunt primary predators.  

There also exists a "production-consumption" behavior in the biological world. A typical example is the leafcutter ant, which cuts leaves from trees and other plants to cultivate fungi, then feeds its larvae with the grown fungi. Since these fungi are "produced" by the leafcutter ants and ultimately consumed by them, this behavior cannot be deemed grabbing within the leafcutter ant-fungus system but rather a form of mutualism. Similarly, the relationship between humans and domesticated livestock or cultivated crops also falls under mutualism—for these organisms are "produced" by humans. However, if individuals frequently poach wild animals without assisting in their reproduction to maintain population levels, leading to a decline in these wild species, this does constitute grabbing behavior. Additionally, certain parasitic organisms that extract material and energy from hosts without providing any benefits to the hosts can also be classified as engaging in grabbing behavior.  

[Grabbing behavior has a key characteristic—grabbing deficit.]() This critical concept will be discussed immediately below.  

## Law of Grabbing Deficit – 1+1<2 Model 【★★★】  

### Definition of Grabbing Deficit  

Next, we will explore a fundamental concept that permeates the entire book: grabbing deficit. This concept is both crucial and easy to grasp. To simplify understanding of this model, we can consider "material and energy" as the primary source for enhancing an organism’s broad-sense fitness (though in reality, this should also include territory, mates, etc.). Suppose there are two individuals, A and B, where A adopts a grabbing strategy. When A plunders material and energy from B—for example, by snatching B’s food (or directly consuming B)—both A and B incur costs (in terms of material and energy). This is because grabbers cannot easily seize another’s vested interests without expending material and energy to execute the grab, nor will the target of grabbing passively surrender its interests without expending material and energy to resist. Thus, regardless of who ultimately gains the food, the total value (material and energy) of the group composed of A and B will incur a deficit. It is essential to emphasize repeatedly that grabbing deficit is measured at the group level, not the individual level. We can simplify the Law of Grabbing Deficit as the 1+1<2 model: when a grabbing individual exists among A and B, the total value of the group they form is less than the sum of their individual values.  

Notably, if A succeeds in grabbing, it will obtain the material and energy of the food at a cost much lower than what it would have expended to acquire the food through non-grabbing means—this is the advantage A gains through grabbing. Thus, grabbing can enhance the fitness of the successful individual and increase its genetic propagation probability. Grabbing deficit, however, applies to the group as a whole.  

[From the perspective of long-term biological evolution, nearly all grabbing behaviors are accompanied by varying degrees of deficit]() (excluding behaviors that only claim rightful rewards, which are not considered grabbing). The reason lies in the gradual accumulation of genetic advantages among grabbers, which eventually eliminates non-grabbing individuals. Consequently, the number of grabbing individuals increases, while non-grabbing individuals decline. The Law of Grabbing Deficit is widely observed in both the natural world and human society, and it is nearly the opposite concept of the Law of Cooperative Dividend, which will be discussed later.  

While grabbing does not always result in deficit—for example, humans often raise chickens, cattle, and sheep for food, a process that involves taking material and energy from these organisms but generally incurs little grabbing deficit because humans produce these organisms through farming and rearing, and do not need to engage in energy-intensive struggles to obtain their material and energy—most other grabbing behaviors do incur varying degrees of deficit. This book primarily focuses on such grabbing behaviors that result in deficit.  

### Identifying Deficit from an Evolutionary Perspective  

One critical point requires further clarification to fully grasp the definition of grabbing deficit: [the deficit we refer to includes not only immediate losses but also anticipated losses in evolutionary trends](). For instance, if a person steals another’s belongings, the immediate grabbing deficit may seem minimal—since the victim does not find the thief, no physical altercation occurs. Superficially, this is merely a transfer of benefits without immediate deficit. However, from an evolutionary perspective, the thief’s fitness increases due to acquiring additional survival resources, while the victim’s fitness decreases due to losing resources. Consequently, the gene frequency of value creators in the group will decline, while that of thieves will rise, reducing the group’s cooperative dividend. Thus, evolutionary perspective also reveals a grabbing deficit.  

A key assumption here is that if a thief devotes time and effort to stealing, they are less likely to focus on creating value through cooperation. The time and opportunity costs of stealing represent a grabbing deficit for the group. It must be re-emphasized that while the direct group deficit from such stealing may be small, the thief gains significantly while the creator loses significantly. From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, thief genes propagate more rapidly, while creator genes are suppressed. This deficit grows swiftly as the gene frequency of thieves increases, so even small deficits can quickly accumulate into larger ones through evolution.  

From an evolutionary standpoint, grabbers can incur deficit even without direct contact. A typical example is sperm competition in the "sexual conflict" discussed later, where competition for mates compels some organisms to produce excessively large or numerous sperm to achieve what would otherwise be a simple mating process. When we use terms like "arms race," "infighting," "internal depletion," or "involution," we are essentially describing such grabbing deficit phenomena. Because massive grabbing deficits arise from the presence of other grabbers, the Law of Grabbing Deficit can also be called the "Others Are Hell" Law.  

## The Adversarial Evolutionary Origin of Grabbingism  

If Self-Cultivationism, which adheres to the principle of "cultivating oneself to perfection," represents a genetic type without traces of Adversarial Evolution, then Consumption-Grabbingism already exhibits distinct characteristics of Adversarial Evolution. In essence, Grabbingism is an evolutionary outcome of countering Self-Cultivationism. Without numerous self-cultivating plants continuously improving their photosynthetic efficiency, there would be no animals feeding on plants for energy, let alone higher-level predators feeding on these primary consumers. The concentration of material and energy is the Adversarial Evolutionary condition that drives the emergence of grabbing organisms. The higher the density of material and energy, the greater the net gain from grabbing after accounting for grabbing deficit. If the material and energy consumed in preying on and digesting plants exceed the material and energy gained, no animals would be willing to make a living by preying on them. As we will discuss later, this is also one of the intrinsic causes of the Cambrian Explosion.  

Simulation programs yield consistent conclusions: when the number of Self-Cultivationist individuals per unit area is sufficiently large, the number of Grabbingist individuals gradually increases.

Organisms targeted by grabbing evolve various traits to resist or escape being grabbed, such as faster swimming, running, or flying speeds, harder protective shells, toxin production, and larger body sizes. In response, grabbers evolve countermeasures to improve their grabbing success rates. This interplay between escaping grabbing and enhancing grabbing efficiency leads to a phenomenon known as coevolution between grabbers and their targets. Coevolution can be considered a quintessential example of Adversarial Evolution.  

This evolutionary antagonism has persisted since the early emergence of life, truly guiding the direction of biological evolution. The criteria for this guidance and selection change dynamically with the environment composed of other organisms. While Darwinian evolution emphasizes this relativity less, it is the decisive factor in shaping the evolutionary direction of life forms.  

[In other words, the fate and evolutionary direction of a species’ genes are often determined by the genes of other species with which it engages in Adversarial Evolution, including the species’ own tendency to evolve in opposition to itself.]()  

[Grabbing is the most primitive evolutionary driving force within the framework of genetic variation and natural selection—for seizing is generally more efficient than creating and entails lower risk—thus, grabbing exhibits an evolutionary momentum and predisposition in nearly all organisms under all circumstances.]() Like water seeking every opportunity to flow from high to low, individual evolution will exploit all possible opportunities and means to engage in grabbing. For if successful, the grabber’s genes will gain a significant advantage and spread.

The Grabbing Tendency and the Cooperative Tendency (discussed later) will emerge as a pair of mutually constraining, inseparable fated adversaries throughout the history of life's evolution.  

## Ambiguity in the Struggle for Existence: Grabbing - style Struggle vs. Non - grabbing Competition  

### The Hobbesian Jungle  
Due to the widespread existence of long - standing grabbing and anti - grabbing behaviors between predators and prey in the biological world, the most direct impression of evolution is that of a natural world governed by the law of the jungle—"the strong preying on the weak" and "survival of the fittest" through grabbing struggles. In fact, this ingrained notion predates the formulation of evolutionary theory. As early as the 16th century, Thomas Hobbes had already proposed the concept of the Hobbesian Jungle.  

The Hobbesian Jungle is a fearsome term in sociology. It refers to a "state of nature" envisioned by the sociologist Thomas Hobbes. In this state, every individual's life is "poor, solitary, nasty, brutish, and short." From this, the concept of the "law of the jungle"—where the strong prey on the weak—has emerged. Under the law of the jungle, there is no morality, no compassion, no mutual aid; only a cold - blooded food chain prevails. Relations between people are cold and devoid of empathy, and everyone is willing to sacrifice others to ensure their own survival.  

<p align="center">

</p>  

The Hobbesian Jungle hypothesis posits that in the absence of state institutions, every individual is an enemy to every other. People will go to great lengths to steal or rob others' property and also strive to prevent their own property from being stolen or robbed. Under such stateless conditions, individuals invest significant time and energy in both grabbing others' interests and avoiding being grabbed themselves. As a result, productive cooperative activities cannot develop, and war may break out at any moment.  

### Hobbesian Struggle  
Hobbes argued that self - preservation from violent death is the supreme necessity of humanity, and power stems from this necessity. In the state of nature, while some individuals may be stronger or smarter than others, no one is so strong or intelligent as to be invulnerable to violent death. When threatened with death, people in the state of nature will inevitably exert all their efforts to preserve themselves.  

In the "state of nature" described by Hobbes, everyone has a need for everything in the world and holds the right to dispose of everything. However, since the world's resources are limited, this struggle for power—"a war of all against all"—never ends. Life in this state of nature, according to Hobbes, is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Translating this into evolutionary terms: natural resources are finite, and each biological individual, in order to protect itself and reproduce more offspring, needs everything in the world, thus falling into a "war of all against all."  

<p align="center">  
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e35b3b-70a4-46c0-aeb9-fbfd6d96f59c" />  
</p>  

Hobbes believed that in this war of all against all, there is no such thing as injustice. For in the absence of a common power, there are no laws, and without laws, there is no justice. Although individuals in the state of nature are equal and absolutely free, it is undeniably a state of suffering.  

### The Broad Sense of Struggle for Existence  
The fundamental assumption of the Hobbesian Jungle theory is that every individual is a "Grabbingist," and they engage in interest - grabbing against one another, leading to a war of all against all. Closely similar to the Hobbesian Jungle theory, evolutionary theory, inspired by the animal kingdom, posits that the broad sense of struggle for existence is the main driving force of evolution in classical evolutionary thought. Whether between species or within a species, all evolutionary impetus is believed to stem from the struggle for existence. However, this vague concept has, in fact, misled later generations. In reality, we must distinguish between grabbing - style struggle and non - grabbing competition.  

### Non - grabbing Competition  
Non - grabbing Competition refers to a competitive relationship that arises indirectly among individuals of the same species or different species within the same ecological niche. Due to differences in predation efficiency and skills, more efficient individuals will capture food sources first, leaving less food for less efficient ones, ultimately leading to the elimination of the less efficient. I term this phenomenon "Non - grabbing Competition," which is fundamentally distinct from grabbing - style struggle.  

Non - grabbing Competition often occurs among different individuals of the same species or different species within the same ecological niche. They do not engage in mutual killing; instead, they "each try their own methods" to see who can catch food, avoid predators, and survive. The key point is: [Non - grabbing Competition does not result in Grabbing Deficit] (), nor does it involve grabbing behavior. It merely leads to a bias in the investment of survival and genetic resources, directing more natural resources to offspring with stronger survival abilities, better health, and greater adaptability to the natural environment.  

Non - grabbing Competition is an important pathway for organisms to "improve themselves" and serves as the evolutionary impetus for Self - Cultivationism. It is more akin to a natural "examination," where those with higher "scores" (better survival abilities) survive, and those with lower "scores" may be eliminated. For example, among owls and cats, as well as among different individuals within the owl and cat species, non - grabbing competition takes place in the context of catching mice. Those with better mouse - catching skills will catch mice first, leaving the more difficult - to - catch mice for others. Consequently, individuals with poorer mouse - catching skills may face elimination. However, neither owls and cats nor their different individuals engage in mutual grabbing—owls do not steal mice that cats have already caught.  

Although intense individual competition often leads to a shift from non - grabbing competition to grabbing - style struggle in behavioral strategies; and although in the biological world, especially among animals, grabbing - style struggle is more commonly observed, clarifying the distinction between these two concepts is crucial for understanding the content of subsequent chapters. In what follows, we will discuss the various forms of grabbing - style struggle in the biological world from both inter - specific and intra - specific perspectives.
