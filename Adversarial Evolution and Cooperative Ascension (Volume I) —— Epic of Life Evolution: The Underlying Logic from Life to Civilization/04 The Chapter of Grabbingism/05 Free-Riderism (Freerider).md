# Free-Riderism (Free-Rider)  
Finally, we supplement a form of mild Grabbingism—Free-Riderism. The theory of free-riding was first proposed by American economist Mancur Olson in his 1965 book *The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups*. Its basic meaning is enjoying the benefits provided by others without incurring any costs. Specifically, Free-Riderism refers to individuals who only wait for others to help them, offer no reciprocation themselves, and also refuse to help others when encountering similar situations. This term has now become an academic concept, and the "free-rider problem" is a very common issue in socioeconomic studies. How to avoid the free-rider problem is a key consideration in the design of socioeconomic systems.

What is the relationship between Free-Riderism and Grabbingism? I also draw on the concept from *The Logic of Collective Action*: positive and negative externalities. Externalities refer to the non-market impacts of economic activities (by firms or individuals) on others and society, which are categorized into positive externalities and negative externalities. A positive externality occurs when an economic actor's activity benefits others or society, but the beneficiaries do not incur costs. A negative externality occurs when an economic actor's activity harms others or society, but the perpetrator does not bear the costs of the external damage. For example, if someone sets off fireworks in their yard for personal enjoyment, the fireworks not only bring joy to themselves but also to their neighbors watching the display, who do not pay for this benefit—this is a positive externality, meaning the neighbors are "free-riding" on the fireworks. Another example: a factory discharges sewage during production, polluting rivers and affecting the health of nearby residents. Since the residents have no economic ties with the factory and the factory provides no compensation, this is a negative externality. Free-Riderism falls under the category of "positive externalities," while Grabbingism falls under "negative externalities." However, in this book, I simplify the concepts by collectively referring to both "Free-Riderism" and "Grabbingism" as "Grabbingism." From an evolutionary perspective, their mathematical essences are similar. Free-Riderism does not actively seize benefits, so it generally does not cause direct deficits from grabbing. However, evolutionarily, its deficit manifests in the future. The fitness advantage gained by free-riders (through unearned benefits) will, in turn, eliminate individuals who are more inclined to mutual aid and cooperation, thereby creating greater group value and cooperative dividends. The proliferation of Free-Riderism will lead to the degradation of the entire group toward Grabbingism.
