# Inter-species Grabbing Behavior – "All Living Beings Bustle for Gain"

## "Survival of the Fittest" – Predatory Grabbing Behavior

Predatory grabbing behavior pervades the entire food chain, manifesting in diverse forms from the top to the bottom of trophic levels. Well-known large feline mammals such as lions, tigers, and cheetahs, along with their dietary requirements, are familiar to most, so I will not elaborate further here. From the cycles of the food chain, we can observe that an arms race and life-and-death struggles nearly always unfold between predators and their prey.

</p>

In fact, top predators of every era leave a profound impression, sharing a common trait—their body size surpasses most other organisms of their time. The first large consumers to emerge in the Ediacaran Period were enigmatic "fractal organisms" known as macroscopic life forms (large relative to earlier single-celled organisms but small compared to later large animals), represented by *Dickinsonia* and *Tribrachidium*. These species flourished in the Ediacaran Period but rapidly went extinct.

</p>

True "mobile" animals first appeared in the Cambrian Period, with the over-one-meter-long *Anomalocaris* reigning as the top predator of its time—the first dominator of the animal kingdom.

</p>

Subsequently, the Ordovician and Silurian Periods were dominated by the three-meter-long arthropod *Eurypterus* (sea scorpion) and the seven-to-eight-meter-long cephalopod *Cameroceras*.

</p>

In the Devonian Period, jawed fish rose to prominence, with *Dunkleosteus* and *Titanichthys*—up to eight-to-nine meters in length—as the era's rulers.

</p>

By the Carboniferous Period, organisms had adapted well to terrestrial and aerial environments, with the 70-centimeter *Meganeura* (giant dragonfly) and the over-two-and-a-half-meter *Arthropleura* (millipede) as the era's dominators.

Next, the Permian Period was dominated by sail-backed creatures like the three-to-five-meter-long *Edaphosaurus* and *Dimetrodon*, paving the way for the arrival of archosaurs.

</p>

From the Triassic through the Jurassic to the Cretaceous Periods, dinosaurs reigned as absolute dominators across land, sea, and air, ruling the animal world for 160 million years. Some species reached lengths of up to 30 meters, far exceeding previous dominators. Their reign abruptly ended with the Cretaceous mass extinction. After their demise, dinosaurs vacated ecological niches for mammals, which grew in size as the class flourished. Before humanity's "Great Leap Period," large mammals populated the globe. However, with humanity's rise, these large mammals suffered mass extinctions, and humans became Earth's new dominators.

<p align="center">

</p>

These top predators once enjoyed boundless glory, becoming the icons of their eras. Yet, without exception, these ultimate grabbing beings eventually met extinction—a testament to the adage "to cause one's downfall, first make them reckless." Now occupying this "throne," will humanity follow the fate of past top consumers? Only time will tell.

## "Covert Advance" – Parasitic Grabbing Behavior

People often assume that grabbing beings must possess larger bodies or greater physical strength to subdue their targets. This is not necessarily true. While predatory grabbing along the food chain is relatively overt—with apex predators like tigers and lions exuding prowess, and their arms races with prey driving the evolution of stronger physiques, swifter speeds, sharper weapons, and sturdier shells—such behavior is not the most "efficient" form of grabbing. In Adversarial Evolution, grabbing behavior "pursues" maximal gain with minimal cost. Insidious, cunning, and malicious Parasitoidism exemplifies such a "sophisticated" grabbing behavior. Though animals lack human intelligence, their evolved狡诈 (cunning) often surpasses human deceit. [The no-effort gain of parasitic grabbing yields such high returns that it pervades the biological world. Hosts (parasitized organisms) endure suffering, their fitness drastically declines, and some even die directly, resulting in significant losses under the Law of Grabbing Deficit.]() Of course, some parasitic relationships fall under mutualism and are not included here. The term "parasitoid" (拟寄生) is used because these parasites are excessively greedy, draining hosts to the point of exhaustion. Let us explore some intriguing—and unsettling—cases of this phenomenon, venturing into the "Hobbesian Jungle" of the biological world.

### The Horrifying World of Parasitoidism [Optional Reading]

#### Zombie Ants

A fungus that lived 48 million years ago could alter and control ant behavior through chemical secretions, turning them into puppets until death. Evidence of its horror was first discovered on leaf fossils from the Messel Pit near Darmstadt, Germany, dating to approximately 48 million years ago. These "zombie ants" resembled walking corpses, reduced to mere shells.

<p align="center">
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4a77c12-7422-4323-a6da-3595913d7dfe" />
</p>

Scientists have found that this parasitic fungus evolved the ability to manipulate its hosts in ancient times, even earlier than the uplift of the Himalayas. Wood ants typically contract the fungus while traversing forest undergrowth before returning to their canopy nests. The fungus grows within the ant, releasing chemicals that alter behavior, transforming the ant into a zombie. Some "zombie ants" abandon their colonies, wandering alone in search of fresh leaves. In their final hours, they climb to the underside of a leaf, clamping their mandibles onto the central vein, trapping themselves—and the fungus—on the leaf. After the ant's death, the fungus sprouts from its head, producing spores that launch into the forest undergrowth at night to infect other ants. Like a human plague, it spreads relentlessly, striking fear.

The lifecycle of zombie ants is distinct. Infection begins when spores land on an ant or when they encounter spores on the rainforest floor. Once attached, spores penetrate the ant's body via enzymes, and the fungus begins to grow. After approximately a week, fungal chemicals disorient the ant, causing it to bite a leaf vein or other plant in its final moments. In later stages, the fungus rapidly consumes the ant's nutrients while establishing "colonies" externally. Over time, these growths lengthen and become more visible, maturing into the zombie fungus. In the final infection stage, the fungus erupts from the ant's head; characteristics vary by fungal species. Ultimately, the fungus forms a single stalk, leaving the hapless zombie ant reduced to a forked stem.

#### Zombie Snails

Ants are far from the only victims—neither the first nor the last. The next protagonist is the snail, a common creature often seen in damp corners or after morning rain. The bizarre, cruel, and even terrifying parasitic behavior known as "zombie snails" indeed exists. Though *Leucochloridium* (双盘吸虫) has been scientifically documented for over a century, it was not until 2013 that biologist Tomasz Wesołowski of the University of Wrocław confirmed that this parasite can control snail brains. "Zombie snails" refer to amber snails (*Succinea*) parasitized by *Leucochloridium* species.

When a snail is parasitized by *Leucochloridium*, the parasite invades its digestive system, developing into a long tubular structure filled with hundreds of reproductive cercariae. This tube then invades the snail's tentacles, creating a grotesque, swollen, pulsating appearance to attract birds. When a bird eats the snail, it becomes the parasite's second-stage host. Parasite eggs are excreted in the bird's feces onto plants, where they re-infect other snails, perpetuating the lifecycle.

#### Ichneumon Wasps and *Glyptapanteles* Wasps

Many people are inherently afraid of caterpillars, yet in the face of parasitic grabbing behavior, caterpillars are actually pitiable victims. Wasps of the genus *Glyptapanteles* lay their eggs inside caterpillars, acting like parasites that erode the host until they gain control of its "mind," merging with it. Eventually, when the wasp larvae mature, they cruelly bore their way out of the zombified caterpillar, and even enlist the caterpillar to serve as their guard. Among parasitoid organisms, few are as menacing and eerie as certain species of wasps in the genus *Glyptapanteles*. Female wasps of these species deposit their eggs inside caterpillars. The larvae develop within the zombified host, feeding on the caterpillar’s bodily tissues, and finally emerge from the host’s body once fully grown. Unlike zombie ants and snails infected by 48-million-year-old fungi, the host caterpillar does not die immediately after the wasp larvae exit its body—it survives.  

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a312f7bd-2093-4bf8-8939-230479fe19a2" />
</p>  

By this point, the caterpillar no longer acts of its own volition; the wasp larvae have taken control of its "mind." During the larvae’s cocooning and hatching period, the zombified caterpillar remains motionless nearby, neither eating nor drinking, to protect the parasites. The caterpillar eventually succumbs to starvation, but by then the young wasps have already emerged from their cocoons and flown away. The larvae of these *Glyptapanteles* wasps not only manipulate the host’s behavior significantly but also transform the caterpillar into a "zombie bodyguard." Compared to unprotected larvae, those under the guard of a zombified caterpillar enjoy a higher survival rate. Female wasps locate target caterpillars and deposit approximately 80 eggs inside them. Once hatched, the larvae feed on the caterpillar’s flesh, carefully avoiding critical organs to prevent the host’s immediate death. Within the host, these larvae progress through several developmental stages. As the *Glyptapanteles* larvae mature, the parasitized caterpillar’s body swells increasingly, yet it shows no signs of behavioral manipulation. Even when the caterpillar’s body swells to the point of near explosion, its behavior remains entirely unremarkable.  

Finally, the larvae must exit the host. This process completes within just one hour—they release chemicals to paralyze the caterpillar, and each larva begins boring its way out. Despite this excruciating ordeal, the caterpillar survives. As the wasp larvae cluster to spin their cocoons, the caterpillar assists by using its silk to help construct protective coverings. Once all larvae have cocooned, the caterpillar shifts into a defensive mode, guarding the cocoons and attacking any approaching threats. This "zombified caterpillar" becomes a loyal sentinel, ceasing to move or feed. It stands on its hind legs, thrashing its body to fend off intruders, and even uses its mouth to bite and fling away predators. The capacity of these wasps to exploit other organisms is unparalleled in cruelty—so much so that even Darwin declared a benevolent creator would never design such creatures.  

#### Zombie Bees  
Perhaps because the distant relatives of bees—the *Glyptapanteles* and *Homalotylus* wasps—have committed such heinous acts of grabbing, nature has punished bees with a similar fate (though bees are truly paragons of mutualistic cooperation and industriousness in the biological world). Let us now turn to zombie bees. As their name suggests, zombie bees behave like the undead: disoriented, stumbling, and active at night. Scientific investigations reveal that a parasitic fly is the culprit behind this phenomenon, and it has become a major factor in the decline of bee populations.  

"Zombie bees" were first discovered in California, USA, in 2008. They have since been reported in Oregon, Washington, California, and South Dakota. The parasite responsible is a type of phorid fly, which deposits its eggs into the abdomen of bees. The fly larvae feed on the bee’s brain matter, brutally dissolving its internal tissues. Once parasitized, the bee’s behavior becomes "zombified." After seven days, up to 25 fly larvae emerge from the head and thorax of each infected bee. The zombie bee dies within five minutes of the larvae’s emergence.  

<p align="center">

</p>  

Scientists suggest that bees are likely parasitized while foraging at night. Infected bees, or their colony mates, detect their abnormality, prompting the host to leave the hive either voluntarily or by force. Reports indicate that a beekeeper in a Seattle suburb returned from vacation to find a large number of dead bees and many others flying erratically. Having heard of zombie bees, Mr. Horn placed several dead bees in a plastic bag; weeks later, he discovered parasite pupae, confirming that the phorid fly had infiltrated Washington State.  

#### The Tongue-Eating Louse: *Ceratothoa italica*  
Known colloquially as the "alien parasite," *Ceratothoa italica* (tongue-eating louse) primarily feeds on fish tongues, subsisting on the host’s blood to grow. In March 2012, media reported that *Ceratothoa* had been discovered in the Mediterranean, where it infests the mouths of sea bream, devouring their tongues and replacing them. This parasite spreads most rapidly in overfished waters. While it poses no threat to humans, *Ceratothoa* inflicts catastrophic harm on sea bream, stunting their growth and reducing their lifespan. Moreover, its appearance is truly grotesque. To avoid causing discomfort, I will not include images here, but curious readers may search for them online.  

#### Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Cordyceps)  
The parasitic phenomena described above may be unfamiliar to many, yet China’s renowned medicinal herb, *Ophiocordyceps sinensis* (commonly called "winter worm summer grass"), is itself a product of parasitism. This fungus, belonging to the subphylum *Ascomycota* and family *Clavicipitaceae*, parasitizes the larvae of ghost moths (Lepidoptera: *Hepialus*). The fungus invades the larvae in autumn and winter, and by spring and summer, its fruiting body (the "grass" portion) emerges from the insect’s body, growing upright like a fleshy rod.

### The Cunning of Brood Parasitism [Optional Reading]  
If the stories of parasitoidism above inspire dread, another type of brood parasitism evokes a sense of biological cunning and malice. Take the cuckoo, a well-known brood-parasitic bird. Brood-parasitic birds lay their eggs in the nests of other species, compelling the hosts to incubate and raise their offspring, thereby evading the costs of parental care.  

<p align="center">
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/709258c2-62da-4079-869a-62c9f3bda79e" />
</p>  

In the avian world, approximately 80 species across five families exhibit interspecific brood parasitism, accounting for 1% of all bird species globally. These include cuckoos (Cuculidae), ducks (Anatidae), weavers (Ploceidae), blackbirds (Icteridae), and honeyguides (Indicatoridae). In China, only the large cuckoo, medium cuckoo, small cuckoo, and Indian cuckoo (all Cuculidae) engage in brood parasitism. Not all cuckoos are parasitic "robbers," however; some species build nests, incubate eggs, and raise their young independently.  

Brood parasites typically lay their eggs before the host begins incubating its own. They usually deposit one egg per host nest, though sometimes multiple. If the host’s eggs have already started incubating, the parasite may destroy them—for example, cowbirds puncture host eggs with their beaks and claws, preventing hatching and extending the host’s incubation period. Brood parasitism is often a rapid act; the banded bay cuckoo (*Clamator jacobinus*), for instance, can lay an egg in a host’s nest in just five seconds. To maximize success, some brood parasites target hosts closely related to themselves (e.g., African indigobirds, Viduinae), while others choose hosts with similar ecological habits. Regardless, parasites always select hosts with comparable incubation and nesting periods, as well as similar chick diets.  

#### The Common Cuckoo  
The common cuckoo (*Cuculus canorus*) is the most iconic of the 80+ brood-parasitic bird species, parasitizing at least 125 known host species.  

<p align="center">
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31a9573c-61ce-446d-acf9-53508cb7ec14" />
</p>  

During the breeding season, the common cuckoo neither builds a nest nor incubates its own eggs. Instead, it seeks hosts with similar incubation and nesting periods, matching chick diets, and eggs that are easy to mimic—typically passerine birds. It seizes the brief window before the host begins incubating, quickly depositing its eggs while the host is away. A female cuckoo lays 2–10 eggs annually, relying on species like babblers and reed warblers to incubate them.Remarkably, some cuckoo species, such as the Asian koel (*Eudynamys scolopaceus*), engage in "collaborative parasitism." In this strategy, males first distract the host, luring it away from the nest, while females lying in wait rapidly deposit their eggs.  

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f69634d-c26d-449a-946d-e6ad51d1d156" />
</p>

To ensure successful parasitism, the cunning common cuckoo lays only one egg in each host nest it visits. Before oviposition, cuckoos often remove one of the host's eggs or push all host eggs out of the nest, forcing the host to lay new eggs. Once the brood-parasitic chick hatches, the ruthless cuckoo nestling exhibits a behavior of pushing the foster siblings out of the nest, thereby monopolizing care from the foster parents. When aligned with the logic of Adversarial Evolution, animals can readily evolve such complex behaviors—once anticipated evolutionary benefits emerge, all that remains is for genetic mutations to occur.  

<p align="center">
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea38348-ca56-427d-b85f-828a2b9547a2" />
</p>
<p align="center">The brood-parasitic cuckoo chick hatches first and pushes the host's eggs out of the nest</p>  

In reality, hosts do not passively endure such exploitation. The co-evolution of brood parasitism (a manifestation of Adversarial Evolution) is reflected in the morphological traits of host eggs. As parasitic eggs exhibit indistinct differences in color and size, hosts, driven by natural selection, continuously enhance their ability to discriminate between eggs. Brood parasitism also includes intraspecific nest parasitism (INP) among birds. Due to its covert nature, this behavior was discovered late by ornithologists, with systematic research only commencing in the 1950s. Since 1980, foreign scholars have compiled lists of bird species exhibiting INP, with the current tally reaching as high as 236 species.  

#### Such malicious brood-parasitic behavior is not exclusive to birds; given the opportunity, other species can also evolve it. The cuckoo catfish (Synodontis multipunctatus), a fish species named after the cuckoo, exemplifies this. In Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, these catfish target a very specific host: thick-lipped cichlids that use their mouths as nurseries to rear their young. As the cichlid deposits her eggs and scoops them into her mouth, the agitated catfish pair swiftly dives beneath her and lays their eggs in the same location. The cichlid then scoops both her own eggs and the cuckoo catfish eggs into her mouth for care.  

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">Cichlid</p>  

Cichlids that fail to detect the cuckoo catfish's ruse will hold both their own eggs and the catfish eggs in their mouths. During incubation, the cuckoo catfish eggs hatch rapidly, outpacing the cichlid eggs. They absorb nutrients as much as possible first, then feed on the cichlid eggs' nutrients. Within just a few days, the cuckoo catfish fry devour all the cichlid eggs, and may even cannibalize one another. As soon as the cichlid opens her mouth, the catfish fry dart out and disperse. The cichlid, having fasted for days while diligently guarding, ends up rearing the offspring of her adversary, the cuckoo catfish.  

The various interspecific Grabbingism behaviors described above, while showcasing the endless wonders of the natural world, clearly demonstrate the underlying patterns of Adversarial Evolution. Behind these diverse Grabbingism behaviors, the victims often suffer severe losses, with some even facing the risk of extinction. Parasites that engage in "excessive extraction" cannot survive if their hosts go extinct. Thus, such "extreme" Grabbingists will ultimately perish alongside the "fitted" victims they exploit. Consequently, the evolutionary paths of both parties have diverged entirely from "adaptation to nature."  

[In reality, some "overly sophisticated" Grabbingism behaviors prove unsustainable, as they disrupt population balance; conversely, "clumsy" Grabbingism behaviors may endure over time. As the saying goes, "draining the pond to catch fish leaves no fish next year." From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, the ultimate fate of such "extreme" Grabbingists is rarely favorable.]
