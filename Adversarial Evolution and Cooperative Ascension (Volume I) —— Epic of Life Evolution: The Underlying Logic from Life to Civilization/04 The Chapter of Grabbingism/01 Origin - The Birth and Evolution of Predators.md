This chapter will gradually introduce the basic concepts and mathematical models of "Grabbingism" and "Law of Grabbing Deficit". They will serve as one of the fundamental theories running through the entire book. Before proceeding, I will first introduce the underlying rules governing all life mechanisms based on genetic materials (such as RNA and DNA) in nature, which determine the developmental patterns of Adversarial Evolution:  
- The replicability and expressivity of genes (expressing the gene's own replication container)  
- Gene replication and expression require material and energy resources  
- Changes occur during gene replication (replication errors, gene mutations)  

Among these, "expressivity" refers to the ability of gene coding to act as an assembly blueprint for biological individuals, used to "produce" biological individuals, which can be understood as the "replicators" of genes—i.e., the containers for gene replication and expression. We must recognize that this is an infinitely cyclical rule: the purpose of gene expression is to produce gene replicators, and gene replicators seek to collect material and energy resources to carry out gene replication. [Although abstractly, the material and energy required by genes are extremely low (analogous to a computer's storage disk), gene containers require material and energy to replicate more genes and even more gene containers. Thus, acquiring material and energy becomes the most important "purpose" and "motive" of life.]  

Most of the various strategies of life individuals are related to more efficiently acquiring material and energy. Material and energy are scarce and their distribution is dispersed. Preying on biological individuals rich in material and energy is a highly efficient means of material and energy intake in nature, forming the basis for the evolutionary strategy of "Grabbingism" genes. This is also a primary characteristic of the life world from an individualistic perspective, particularly prominent in the animal kingdom.  

# Origin—The Birth and Evolution of Predators  
Students who have studied high school biology are not particularly unfamiliar with the concepts of producers and consumers. Producers refer to green plants, which can convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis and transform inorganic substances into organic matter, providing not only for their own growth and development but also serving as a food and energy source for other biological groups. Consumers are biological categories that directly or indirectly utilize the organic matter produced by producers as a food and energy source, generally referring primarily to animals but also including certain parasitic fungi.  

### The Earliest Predators  
Sometimes we give consumers a more vivid name—Predators (occasionally called hunters or predators). In fact, predators emerged later than producers and have relatively smaller population sizes. The earliest predators may have been cells that abandoned producing organic matter necessary for their own survival. They extended their cell membranes to enclose other cells, disassembling the bodies of these other cells as raw materials and energy sources for their own growth. These shape-shifting protoplasmic masses became Earth's earliest predators.  

### Tonian Period (1–720 million years ago)  
Predators did not exist from the start. The most ancient organisms were almost all producers, with their energy sources primarily from the sun. However, by the end of the Proterozoic Eon, during the Tonian Period, the first stage of the Neoproterozoic Era, primary consumers began to emerge in scale. *The Earth's Saga* contains a vivid description of this, which I excerpt here:  

> "Beneath the serene moonlight on the sea surface, a silent slaughter unfolds: animals are sharpening their metaphorical knives, ready to feast. Single-celled flagellates and ciliates dart up and down deftly, their rapidly beating cilia stirring currents that funnel bacteria and single-celled algae into their oral grooves. Vorticella and Stentor attach themselves to red algal thalli with sticky stalks, setting up trap-like arrays to devour passing microscopic prey. Amoebas lazily flow their cytoplasm, constantly changing shape while enclosing any small organisms they encounter; the victims' bodies slowly dissolve in food vacuoles, becoming nourishment for the amoebas. Early multicellular animals also eagerly join the feast. Placozoans resemble amoebas in form and movement but are composed of multiple cells, with larger appetites and stronger predatory capabilities. Mesozoans are like scaled-up ciliates, faster and more voracious. The ancient sponge *Otavia antiqua* anchors itself like a Stentor, acting as a small pump: through the beating of inner ciliated cells, it drives seawater through its porous body, filtering out small organisms to digest intracellularly."

The existence of predators drives the Adversarial Evolution of prey, leading to the development of various defense mechanisms. Most notably, some single-celled plants and animals began to equip themselves with armor on their surfaces. These rigid shells vary in composition—some are simply sand grains glued together with mucus, while others are chitin, calcium carbonate, or silica secreted by the cells themselves. These diverse shells not only protect the cells from attack but also increase surface tension and water resistance, making their hosts more buoyant in the ocean. After the death of single-celled organisms, their tiny shells sink to the seabed. Over time, these form fossils known as Acritarchs.  

### Ediacaran Period (635–540 million years ago)  
During the Ediacaran Period, macroscopic biota emerged as the advanced predators of the time. The seawater teemed with bacteria, single-celled algae, protozoa, eggs and larvae of multicellular animals, spores of algae and fungi, and detritus from dead plants and animals. Abundant food and the highest levels of dissolved oxygen in history allowed multicellular predators to gradually evolve into macroscopic organisms.

Macroscopic organisms first transformed their body shapes. Since food and oxygen were dispersed in the seawater, a larger contact area with seawater meant greater access to food and oxygen. Before the evolution of respiratory and digestive systems, flattening themselves into thin discs became the most successful survival strategy for multicellular animals, allowing each cell to directly contact seawater for filter-feeding and respiration. Thus, on the shallow seabed, *Trilobozoa* and *Dickinsonia* spread their bodies calmly. *Swartpuntia* and *Rangea* rose like seaweed, extending their body walls. However, compared to later animals, these macroscopic organisms had much simpler functional differentiation, resembling sponges and not yet fully realizing the potential of multicellular life.

### Cambrian Period (540–480 million years ago)  
A prominent feature of the Cambrian Period was the emergence of more advanced predators. In fact, this trend began in the late Ediacaran Period. Jellyfish drifting in ocean currents, appearing as translucent gelatinous masses, randomly captured small animals swept onto their tentacles. They swam actively, and when encountering jellyfish of similar size, they would enclose them entirely and digest them slowly—these were ctenophores, which evolved the earliest swallowing function. The further coordination of muscular and nervous systems enabled ctenophores to no longer drift passively but actively pursue prey.

During the Cambrian, mesodermal organisms evolved, providing muscle tissue that allowed organisms to no longer drift passively but actively attack. Subsequently, typical animal features such as eyes, teeth, appendages, and notochords evolved sequentially, and apex predators (Apex Predators)—animals that hunt primary predators—also took the stage. Almost all undefended macroscopic organisms from the Ediacaran Period went extinct. The apex predator dominating this era was the *Anomalocaris*, a species exceeding 1 meter in length. *Anomalocaridids* were Earth's first large predatory animals. They established their dynasty in Cambrian oceans, persisting until the early Ordovician Period.

In response to the rampant evolution of apex predators, lower-level predators also developed various defense mechanisms through Adversarial Evolution, with exoskeletons and their diverse evolutionary forms becoming their primary defense. Bivalved arthropods include several groups with no close phylogenetic relationships; their shells evolved independently. However, the evolutionary process was largely similar. Initially, their ancestors were elongated, soft-bodied segmented animals with partially fused segments and emerging heads, with gill appendages for respiration and swimming concentrated in the mid-body. To protect their soft bodies and internal organs, exoskeletons began to calcify and harden. The exoskeleton of one segment extended and expanded, forming two broad discs enclosing part of the body. *Nereocaris exilis* is a representative of this type.

Shells, on the other hand, belong to another route of Adversarial Evolution. Compared to exoskeletons, although shells are cumbersome, they offer several distinct advantages: First, they can grow synchronously with the animal's body. As the animal's body grows, the mantle can continue to secrete calcium at the edge of the shell, enlarging and thickening it. This eliminates the need for a tedious molting process, making shells particularly suitable for slow-moving benthic animals. In addition to mollusks, brachiopods and hyoliths have also evolved shells, and they are often confused with one another. The fact that taxonomically distant animal groups have evolved such similar structures sufficiently demonstrates the success of this design.
