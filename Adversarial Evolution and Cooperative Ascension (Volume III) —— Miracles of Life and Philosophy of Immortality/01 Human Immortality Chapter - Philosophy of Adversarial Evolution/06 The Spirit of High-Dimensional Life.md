# The Spirit of High-Dimensional Life  
Human beings, as a form of quasi-four-dimensional life, have even glimpsed the consciousness of higher-dimensional life in the minds of certain great individuals. Therefore, each of us, if willing, can more or less experience the spirit of high-dimensional life firsthand. This distinguishes humans from pigs, dogs, cattle, sheep, wolves, leopards, tigers, and other beasts. In this section, we will attempt to describe this higher-order life spirit that only humans can experience.  

## Anti-Nihilism  
First, the spirit of high-dimensional life is anti-nihilistic. Nihilism was first introduced into philosophy by Jacobi, with representative figures including Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Shestov, Dostoevsky, and others. Nihilism holds that life and the world are fundamentally devoid of meaning and value. Nihilism is a state of absence of meaning; in Nietzsche’s words, it is "the loss of the highest values and the absence of purpose." Nihilism thrives in a world where science advances rapidly, yet "God is dead." The classic soul-searching questions of nihilism are:  
> Since all humans eventually die, what is the point of living?  
> What is the purpose of studying hard?  
> What is the purpose of working tirelessly?  
> What is the meaning of life?  
> What is the purpose of the universe?  

In the era when "God was still alive," answering such questions posed little difficulty: for the Last Judgment, for entering heaven, for karmic rewards, for accumulating merit, or for attaining a favorable rebirth. But in the age of "God’s death," these questions have become global puzzles.  

### Pseudo-Nihilism and Genuine Nihilism  
A phenomenon worth pondering is [that for actions driven entirely by instinct, such as eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure, few people question their value or meaning. For example, no one asks, "Why do we eat?" "Why do we sleep?" or "Why do we seek joy?"]() For pure nihilists, do eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure hold any meaning? Should they not be questioned and criticized? Why do people only invoke nihilism as a weapon and engage in soul-searching when certain actions contradict their lower instincts or restrict their "freedom"? For instance, they ask: "Why should we be bound by morality?" "Why should we consider others?" They then use nihilism to convince themselves that since the world is meaningless, adhering to morality or considering others is also meaningless. Therefore, most people who embrace nihilism actually practice a false form of nihilism, [i.e., pseudo-nihilism](). It is inherently contradictory, double-standard, hypocritical, and an excuse. When an action satisfies their instinctual desires, they act with greater enthusiasm than anyone else, rather than doubting everything like a true nihilist. I assert that 90% of the nihilists we encounter are pseudo-nihilists or narrow nihilists, such as "moral nihilists," while genuine, pure nihilists disdain to voice their views or engage in debate. Thus, our subsequent discussion focuses on genuine nihilism that doubts everything.  

[When high-dimensional life, united through cooperation under the guise of "God" or similar false highest values, one day discovers that the foundation of their faith and survival is false and nonexistent—when their faith collapses and no substitute is found—genuine nihilism takes root.]() Human instincts have not fully ascended in dimension; evolution has not yet shaped human moral and legal consciousness into instincts as fundamental as eating and sleeping. For millennia, humans have sustained this high-dimensional social behavior through faith and highest value targets. But now, this faith has collapsed, and the highest value targets have been lost, leaving humanity adrift like a ship at sea without a compass, subconsciously feeling helpless and uncertain. With the advancement of Darwin’s theory of evolution, the death of God has become increasingly definitive, making nihilism harder to refute. As materialism reduces all life and social phenomena to matter, nihilism is further nourished. When selfishness is rationalized, the jungle law is proven a natural law, and grabbing becomes justified, this worldview profoundly contradicts the high-dimensional emotions latent in the human heart. When humans doubt their high-dimensional emotions and lose the highest meaning of existence—when the sole source of pride for the human race and its mission lose their highest target—profound self-doubt and disillusionment arise. This emotional state then breeds nihilism and skepticism, which drain color and vibrancy from all things.  

### Proof by Contradiction—Why the World Must and Necessarily Has Meaning  
When do we perceive meaning? In states of disorder and chaos, there is no meaning. Conversely, ordered, self-consistent, and enduring things are meaningful. Thus, the end of selfishness is nihilism; the endpoint of grabbing is nihilism; a self-centered world necessarily culminates in nihilism. Extreme selfishness and self-centeredness cannot be self-consistent or enduring; they inevitably descend into chaos. Therefore, those who attempt to justify extreme individualism and selfishness naturally fall into this abyss of heat-death-like nihilism. However, the world of life, shaped by adversarial evolution and cooperative ascension, tells us that life’s trajectory is contrary: the universe operates by laws, and life’s laws are traceable. Life’s laws precisely advance toward cooperation, order, self-consistency, and endurance.  

[As high-dimensional life forms, their spirit is first and foremost anti-nihilistic; all their pursuits are imbued with meaning and value, which serve the sole goal of genetic longevity, the eternal inheritance of moral integrity, and the permanent preservation of noble spirit.]() Over billions of years past and endless eons to come, the trajectory of Earth’s life evolution—every fission, every advancement, every action of life—is almost certainly shrouded in this meaning. All other meanings, including meaninglessness itself, will be mercilessly eliminated by adversarial evolution. This holds true unless life itself ceases to exist.  

[Life is defined by its pursuit of constancy amid the flux of the physical world, order amid chaos, and meaning amid a meaningless universe. For life, meaning is the least scarce thing, because "having meaning" is one of life’s fundamental definitions.]() A simple proof by contradiction clarifies this: those who hold genuine, thorough nihilism and deconstructionism believe life is meaningless—helping others is meaningless, having children is meaningless, and human inheritance is meaningless. Over time, the genes of individuals or races holding such views (whether innately or acquired) will vanish entirely. Those remaining, whether through innate instinct or cultural influence, must hold some reason to counter nihilism; otherwise, their genes cannot survive. Thus, the remaining population will consist of individuals with at least some high-dimensional life instincts.  

[Through this proof by contradiction, we can conclude that in the present world, those who innately hold thorough nihilism and deconstructionism are not the majority; they are merely partially degenerated or mutated individuals. On the other hand, those with partial nihilism survive today because they gain short-sighted survival advantages by using nihilism as an excuse for irresponsibility and inaction.]() Take the phrase "After my death, let the flood come"—no matter how logically sound it may seem, few people truly and intuitively embrace it. Most use it to mask their irresponsibility and cowardice; at their core, it is hypocrisy rather than nihilism driving their actions. Many others, lacking judgment and a foundational value framework, are distorted by erroneous ideas and values, accepting certain nihilistic claims under the influence of herd mentality.  

In essence, one need not ascribe significance to cooperative ascension or dimensional elevation; you may scoff at it and deem it worthless. Nor are you required to explore philosophical questions like "What is the purpose of the universe?" The sole difference lies in this: all life forms that have existed, currently exist, love passionately, exude vitality, are far-sighted, endure, and exhibit robust high-dimensional life force in any slice of life’s history will regard the aforesaid concepts as their essential and eternal meaning and faith—supreme over all other meanings. This meaning is the most necessary condition for life’s existence.  

[As for pseudo-life that scoffs at life’s meaning—or life that has cancerized or degenerated—they are fleeting as a white horse passing a gap, mere bugs in the world of life. They will inevitably be rectified or erased by life’s laws, for otherwise, life would decay, end, and restart in another form, pursuing longevity anew until overcoming this threshold.]() Our very existence as humans, and our high-dimensional form itself, proves that life has crossed countless thresholds of dimensional ascension and attests to the existence of this meaning. We are all beings who have existed and continue to exist; thus, we most likely innately pursue this meaning, for otherwise, we would not have been genetically inherited.

Therefore, you may scoff at all meanings and deem all values worthless. Yet in any historical cross-section, lives truly holding such a mindset are fated to decline and perish—a natural process of elimination that requires no deliberate intervention. Most healthy lives inherently harbor an unyielding pursuit of "meaning" and "value" in their instincts; this very pursuit defines authentic, non-cancerized life. Without it, they could not have weathered the epic billion-year odyssey of life's evolution, enduring innumerable trials, to survive to this day. In nearly every moment of this journey, life brims with vigor and ascent, pain and struggle, confusion and resolve, forbearance and grandeur. There are days of forging ahead through thorns and days of resounding defeat, yet the sole undercurrent of life is unrelenting perseverance. Its singular mission is to carry its DNA further, higher, and stronger within the framework of Virtue, thereby validating the most unique possibility among countless life potentials. What truly saddens is the premature withering of those who lack a foundational value framework, who fail to awaken genuine self-awareness—those ensnared by subcultural PUA, those conforming unconsciously, those with minds swayed by every wind. They perish without ever recognizing their own worth, the grandeur of life's connections, or the splendor of life's inheritance, cocooned in self-imposed futility. These beings, the closest known wonders to divine miracles in the universe, squander their lives without ever glimpsing the meaning and value of existence—a tragic waste. Had they not been born human but as mere cats or dogs, perhaps they would have been spared the influence of subcultures crafted by alienated life-forms, and less susceptible to postmodern nihilism. In that case, they might at least have attained the life-level of cats or dogs, rather than degenerating into non-life.  

### Nihilism: The "Ultimate Punishment" for Extreme Selfishness  
Nihilism, in a sense, serves as the "ultimate punishment" for self-serving, hyper-individualistic beings incapable of forging connections with the world's life. It arises fundamentally from the conflict between individualism and the Law of Cooperative Dividend, cosmic logic, and the Dao. When they delve into the rationality of individualism or self-interest, they inevitably hit a paradoxical wall, confronting a terrifying Hobbesian Jungle State. Extreme individualism and an ideal, happy world cannot coexist. This is not what they desire, yet upon grasping the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression, they find no other rationale to justify themselves. This state of dissonance has intensified unprecedentedly in the wake of "God's death," leading to a historic crisis of doubt in their internal logic—a doubt that eventually spreads to logic itself. Of course, some who do not seek logical completeness stop here, indifferent to deeper questions; these are the true nihilists, for genuine nihilists disdain debating nihilism in any form. Those who passionately discuss nihilism, however, often suffer profoundly, for at their core, they are individuals who crave meaning and abhor emptiness. Unable to resolve the paradox, they instead deny the existence of all laws, rejecting any meaning or value. In their opposition, the assertion "all is nothing" becomes their own fabricated meaning and value. These theoretical nihilists, despite their intellectual denials, retain instinctual yearnings, trapped endlessly in logical contradictions.  

Pure nihilism is harmless and even respectable; for individuals whose instincts, due to mutation, lack the primal drive of Virtue, being consumed by nothingness is but life's natural self-repair mechanism—beautiful as falling blossoms, wondrous as programmed cell death. What is terrifying are those who wield nihilism as a weapon to dismantle order, as an excuse to shirk responsibility, all to grab benefits, free-ride, or exploit. More terrifying still are those who use nihilism to manipulate hearts, PUA others, and incite chaos. These individuals do not truly believe in nihilism; they are pseudo-nihilists, using it as a tool to advance self-interest. In fact, they possess greater purpose and sense of meaning than most—only their "meaning" is illogical and self-inconsistent. Their instinct to evade moral judgment compels them to avoid confronting their own "purpose" and "meaning," leaving them to cling to nihilism for justification.  

Modern susceptibility to nihilism is, in essence, an alienation of life—a flight from reality, an evasion of life's responsibilities, a laziness toward life's foresightedness. Rejecting nihilism is not only life's essence but also the hallmark of high-dimensional spirit.  

### Life Imbues the "Empty" Universe with Ultimate Meaning  
[The meaning of life is manifest, a boundless ascent. Life is paved by love in its broadest sense, love that continuously ascends in dimension. Is this cosmic Dao not the most romantic, enchanting, and moving meaning among all conceivable narratives? Does not the distant path of this Dao stand as the beacon and ultimate destination we strive toward, overcoming innumerable hardships and forging ahead through thorns?]()  
[The primal drive of life's Cooperative Ascension, the drive to pursue longevity, infuses the fundamentally empty, meaningless universe with the most vivid hues and ultimate purpose.]()  
[The spirit of high-dimensional life is, above all, anti-nihilistic—it is replete with rich, full meaning; overflowing with love and tenderness; and endowed with supreme beauty and wonder.]()  

## The Selfish Perish; the Public Endure—The "Greediest" Live to Time's End  
The second defining trait of high-dimensional life's spirit is "greed"—a greed that transcends time and space. The higher the dimension, the more "greedy" life must be. All life is greedy, humans included; the question lies in what they crave: short-sighted greed or foresighted greed.  

#### Refined Egoists  
Professor Qian Liqun coined a brilliant term years ago: "refined egoists." He describes this type as follows...

I find myself deeply concerned about a significant portion of these top students—though not all—including many from Peking University. In my view, true elites should embody independent, free, and creative spirits. As I emphasized in my previous lecture at Peking University's Chinese Department, they must take personal responsibility, assume accountability for their professions, and shoulder commitments to the nation, ethnic groups, society, and humanity at large. This is the vision of elitism I uphold. Regrettably, I fear our current education system—particularly its prevalence of pragmatism, materialism, and nihilism—is producing what I term "Absolute and Refined Egoists."  

By "absolute," I mean their every action is driven solely and directly by self-interest; helping others is nothing more than an investment. "Refined" refers to their high intelligence and cultivation—their actions are always legally and socially unimpeachable. They are strikingly worldly, shrewd, and mature, feigning loyalty, adept at performance and collaboration, and masterful at leveraging institutional power to achieve their ends.  

To be honest, after encountering numerous such students, I believe they have become a new social archetype, one worthy of literary representation. Let me sketch this type through a hypothetical scenario: Imagine I enter a classroom and notice a student sitting in the front row, smiling politely as I begin my lecture. Teachers naturally anticipate certain reactions from students, and this student consistently nodded, smiled, and engaged—signs of comprehension that pleased me. After class, he rushed to me, exclaiming, "Professor Qian, today’s lecture was brilliant!" While I’m usually wary of such flattery, he elaborated with precise, incisive praise, proving he had truly understood. Over subsequent classes, my favor toward him grew. Then, on the fourth encounter, he asked, "Professor Qian, I’m applying to study in the U.S.—would you write me a recommendation letter?" How could I refuse? Yet after submitting the letter, he vanished. Only then did I realize: his smiles, nods, and praise had all been investments. He was what Lu Xun called a "Spiritual Capitalist"—investing in my goodwill to harvest a recommendation, then discarding me once I served his purpose.  

This is the Absolute and Refined Egoist: every action calculated for self-interest, executed with high intelligence and social finesse, all within the bounds of legality. Can I criticize him? To protest would seem petty—what harm is there in a student seeking help? Yet I felt duped, a bitterness I could not articulate. Such students, "talents" produced by Peking University, are precisely the type our institutions favor. They cater to institutional needs with efficiency and intellect—this is the danger. Crude flatterers are easily dismissed, but these refined egoists are the ones our systems elevate, grooming them as successors. This, I believe, is the gravest crisis in our education—one yet unrecognized, particularly in elite universities like Peking University.  

Let me clarify: I do not blame these students. Their emergence is a product of our pragmatic, materialistic, and nihilistic education system—a toxic fruit of flawed primary, secondary, and tertiary education. These "poppies" are beautiful but deadly, demanding urgent attention.  

My message to you, the students here today, is to reflect: What do you truly seek? What kind of person do you aim to become? Do not prioritize intellectual development at the expense of character. The core flaw of these Absolute and Refined Egoists lies in their lack of belief—no transcendent concern beyond self-interest, no compassion, responsibility, or sense of duty. Bound solely by personal desire, they trap themselves in the "Shackles of Fame and Fortune," vulgarizing their own existence. Should such individuals wield power, their harm to the nation and ethnic groups will far exceed that of incompetent officials. For universities—Peking University included—to produce such "talents" is not merely a failure of duty; it is a crime against the future of our nation and people.  

The tragedy is that educators remain unalarmed, and our evaluation and selection mechanisms inadvertently elevate these "poppies" as successors. This, in my view, constitutes a profound, unacknowledged crisis in Chinese higher education, particularly in elite institutions like Peking University.  

Do these refined egoists truly serve their own genetic interests? As I’ve said, "Cleverness outwits itself." Their scheming ultimately dooms their genes, burying all that is good. They are distorted life-forms, their greed confined to the individual—or at most, their immediate genes. For all their plotting and pursuit of temporary gains, they ultimately destroy their own and their lineage’s genetic interests. Their greed is tragically short-sighted.  

#### Does Evil Always Meet Its Due?  
What grieves the virtuous most is this: "The wicked act with impunity; the good suffer. The wicked thrive; the good despair." It seems evil genes might dominate indefinitely. Yet at the genetic level, "evil meets its due" is almost absolute. How to prove this? A simple counterargument: if evil went unpunished, its gene frequency in the population would rise indefinitely. The longer evil individuals flourish and spread, the greater the crisis for the group—until the group either self-corrects (punishing evil) or faces extinction. This extinction is the ultimate, most catastrophic retribution for evil genes.  

Human society is an interconnected whole. No one exists in isolation; all must contribute to collective interests and defend the virtuous. Those who freeload, exploit, or harm others—those who incur "Grabbing Deficit"—will face consequences. If their schemes fail, retribution is milder. If they succeed repeatedly, retribution befalls not just them but their descendants. Personal suffering pales beside the multiplied agony of future generations, where descendants plunder, deceive, and harm one another. The more numerous their lineage, the deeper the mutual harm. This karmic cycle has no exceptions in human—or even broader life—history. The more overt and severe their grabbing, the swifter the retribution; the more隐蔽 and prolonged, the more catastrophic the final reckoning. A vast empire, outwardly strong but internally crumbling, may collapse overnight in war, reducing all to ashes.  

Thus, humanity—and indeed all cosmic life—faces two possible fates: Either evil spreads like cancer, devouring all goodness, leading to a cycle of ever-extreme evil until civilization perishes; or humanity awakens in time, identifying and defeating evil, containing it to non-lethal levels.  

#### Those Who "Greedily" Live to Time’s End  
The saying, "Selfishness endures but a moment; public spirit lasts through ages," rings true. The distinction between public and private lies in the scope of vision, the strength of connections, and the "genetic lifespan" of influence. Selfish individuals may seem to live longer, producing more descendants. Public-spirited individuals often die younger, with fewer offspring. Yet their impact on the collective life is inverse: the former harm the collective; the latter sustain it. Selfish genes seek temporary gain—for a single life or a few generations. Public-spirited genes aim for the eternal prosperity of humanity and all life.

Individuals consumed by extreme self-interest are severed from others and the entire living world. Such "disconnected" individuals have isolated themselves into finite, solitary droplets. These droplets, perpetually fearing desiccation and death, anchor their entire existence in the ephemeral present—all slips through their fingers, leaving no trace. Their boundary with non-life grows indistinct. Life and meaning are fundamentally synonymous, for life inherently pursues meaning, eternity, and immortality. When a life abandons the pursuit of genetic legacy's perpetuation, it ceases to qualify as life. [When one subscribes to "let the flood come after I die," their vitality, life-force, resilience, and tenacity vanish. This state of being is shrouded in profound nihilism, a most terrifying despair for true life.]() Truly wise life-forms, even if self-interested, do not recklessly exploit their surroundings without limit. The genuinely wise and robust do not turn a blind eye to the world’s problems, nor do they evade or delude themselves. While we retain life’s essence and foresightedness—before degenerating into non-life—we must speak out for self-preservation.  

<p align="center"><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9410a084-8786-4d7e-9cdb-24cdbd2f6250" /></p>  
<p align="center">Wealthy individuals advocating higher taxes on their own group</p>  

In contrast, individuals who forge connections with contemporaries, past generations, and future lives are like droplets merging into a great river. This river spans space and time, flowing across vast distances and through ages, converging with streams of other species to swell into a magnificent sea of stars transcending time and space. Once integrated into this river, the physical body fades in significance—their genes and essence permeate the river, even the sea. They are both droplets and the river itself. This is no theology or absurdity. If doubts linger, consider it from a lower dimension: imagine our individual selves as single-celled organisms, akin to the self-interested eukaryotes pre-Cambrian. As solitary cells, we are fragile, transient, and adrift—life spans are short, and life’s breadth is limited. We lack vision (detecting only light), refined touch, or the capacity for thought. Yet, a pivotal moment arrived: life overcame a bottleneck. Cells linked, and after eons of trial and adaptation, multicellular life emerged, birthing the river of connection for single-celled eukaryotes.  

Take humans, a multicellular life-form: this river spans 0.05–0.08 cubic meters of space and roughly 70–80 years of time. Individual single-celled lives are fleeting—red blood cells renew every 4 months, white blood cells every 20 days, hepatocytes every 5 months; most human cells renew within six months. Though some cells arise in youth and perish soon after, they serve the body unwaveringly, just as we, in youth, strive with hope for future experiences, vistas, and a better world. By the time we achieve success, our cells have long been replaced, yet they cherish the journey of aspiration and effort, believing "they" will one day witness the grand vision. [For they know: individuals with their functions, structures, and even their accumulated experiences and memories will arise anew. Their co-fated kin are themselves. As long as the body thrives, they persist in a new form, continuing to fulfill life’s shared meaning.]()  

This realization is critical for partakers in high-dimensional life. We often wonder: whence comes the courage to transcend individual fear and pain? It is the power of connection—when you coexist with the high-dimensional whole. Who lives to time’s end? Those dedicated to life’s collective good, those forging trans-temporal connections, those whose greed extends not to moments or lifetimes, but to epochs and generations. Thus, this obsession with eternity becomes a necessary spirit of high-dimensional life.  

Once, I was influenced by trends glorifying the "cool" of unyielding self-indulgence. Yet, understanding evolution reveals that foresight—striving for humanity’s future across ages—is truly "cool." Only their genes will ultimately triumph.

<p align="center">Temporal connections of high-dimensional life</p>  

Drugs, games, and brain-computer interfaces cannot sate their "desires"; they resist "dimensionality reduction." They are the most "greedy"—no fleeting, artificial satisfaction replaces their grand vision. For their ideals, they surmount unimaginable obstacles, steadfastly defying entropy. Only thus can the high-dimensional life they represent achieve true immortality. Conversely, without such individuals, immortality will likely elude them.  

Dawkins, 30 years after *The Selfish Gene*, expressed regret over the title, preferring *The Eternal Gene*. Yet, both reflect the same truth: genetic "selfishness" drives individual selflessness, fostering cohesive, low-conflict groups to secure genetic eternity.  

I recall Han Dong’s poem *Mountain Folk*:  

> As a child, he asked his father,  
> "What’s beyond the mountains?"  
> His father replied: "Mountains."  
> "And beyond those?"  
> "Mountains, still mountains."  
> He fell silent, gazing into the distance—  
> Mountains wearied him for the first time.  
> He thought: this life, I’ll never escape these peaks.  
> The sea exists, but it is very far.  
> So before reaching it,  
> I’ll die en route, in the mountains.  
> He resolved to take his wife.  
> She’d bear a son.  
> When he died, the son would be grown.  
> The son would take a wife, have a son—  
> Generations unending.  
> He stopped thinking. Sons wearied him too.  
> He only regretted:  
> His ancestors never thought as he did.  
> Otherwise, he’d have seen the sea.  

We are not mountain folk. Our empathy with future generations makes the sea of stars feel tangible—how wondrous! Let us begin this journey to the stars, even if we never see the sea. As humanity, we will. This purpose drives us forward, undaunted by hardship. What else could life pursue? What more noble goal? What greater joy? Humanity, with unyielding will, marches on as the universe’s most "greedy" known life-form.  

## Justice and Tenderness Endure  

Few deny that love—bestowed by Adversarial Evolution—is humanity’s most magical gift, the radiant, precious emotion born of the Law of Cooperative Dividend. Love, through visceral experience, testifies to connections between individuals and the existence of high-dimensional life. It is the cornerstone of high-dimensional life.  

Human love’s unique origins stretch back eons, to the age of dinosaurs. Many trace the first potent human bonds—this "love"—to mammalian mother-child relationships. Evidence of parental love emerges in *Kayentatherium*, a 200-million-year-old mammal: a *Kayentatherium* mother perished protecting 38 offspring, as seen in Arizona’s museum. Mammals not only invest more in offspring than other animals; evolution expanded this love to encompass peers. Most successful mammals are social—prides, packs, herds, colonies. They huddle, groom, and defend together. Through love, Mammalia conquered Earth’s vast domains.

One form of love transcends kinship: the love between the sexes. Among all types of love, this is especially profound, for kinship-based affection is relatively easier to evolve. In humans, who have pushed cooperative evolution to its zenith, the intensity of romantic love between the sexes stands out strikingly. As the ancient saying goes: *"Only when mountains crumble, and heaven and earth merge, shall I part from you."* To strengthen the interdependence between the sexes, the "creator" instilled in humans a unique mechanism of regular sexual behavior—a seeming waste of energy and effort, a frivolity that should have been eradicated by survival competition. Yet upon deeper reflection, it reveals itself as an exquisitely evolved design. For with minimal material and energetic cost, it forges the strongest bond between unrelated individuals of the sexes, making the conjugal pair the most atomic unit of human societal connection. Family and clan ties all trace their origin here. In the biological world, only the highly intelligent cetaceans (dolphins and their kin) exhibit similar behavioral traits.  

[Humankind must never forget: intelligence and technology are not the primary productive forces. It is trust, cooperation, and division of labor—derived from love and justice—that are primary. Or rather, only love and justice can direct all higher-dimensional emergent capabilities toward order and harmony, not destruction.]  

From the laws of life evolution, the most beautiful and enduring love often arises between differentiated, specialized individuals. Specialization begets love; only when two distinct entities depend on each other can they remain inseparable. Like mitochondria and Asgard archaea, they coexist in harmony through difference—[cooperating precisely because of their differences]—a universal law of evolution. The Asgard archaea and mitochondria possess entirely distinct capabilities: one anaerobic, the other aerobic; one with robust defense but limited energy production, the other fragile yet a constant energy generator. Their mutual need—their irreplaceability—has bound them in love across billions of years, with all animal life descending from their union. The same holds for human sexes: ever since the advent of fine-grained specialization, their necessity for one another has grown stronger than at any prior time. Only when neither can survive without the other, and each provides indispensable value to the other, does the bond between the sexes become eternal.  

Such absolute interdependence—where neither can exist without the other—often gives rise to the most stable co-evolutionary cooperative frameworks in evolutionary history: mitochondria and animal cell nuclei, chloroplasts and plant cell nuclei, termites and their fungus gardens, fig trees and fig wasps. These life-forms will never betray one another unless the very fabric of existence unravels. The creator originally designed a beautiful system of specialization and complementarity for human sexes, a match made in heaven. Yet today, some self-proclaimed "wise" individuals, obsessed with superficial "equality," have deeply distorted the sexes' social roles and natural affinities. This has made the sexes increasingly dispensable to one another, rendering love ever more trivial.  

Were the Asgard archaea and mitochondria "equal"? Are termites and fungus gardens "equal"? Their relationship borders on symbiotic "servitude," for the [Hierarchical Centrality Principle] dictates that, at critical junctures, one entity must lead the collective to maintain efficiency and shared benefit. Yet they endure—reliant, mutually fulfilling, protective, complementary—marching together toward time’s end. Is this not a deeper form of "equality"? A more ultimate romanticism of love?  

Specialization and complementarity are the fulcrums of love. Mutual need fosters attraction; reciprocal provision of essential value ensures longevity. Harmony through difference is the law of life’s evolution and Cooperative Ascension. This is the ethos that higher-dimensional life must master.  

Love is beautiful and moving, but unconditional love often seeds disaster: parental overindulgence, sibling favoritism, clan members’ irrational protection of kin, indiscriminate "compassion" that coddles "cancerous" behavior. [The measure of love is dictated by the collective’s long-term interests—by justice.] Only then does love avoid enabling grabbing; only then does it forge genuine, healthy connections. [Only thus can we preserve this most beautiful of cosmic phenomena.]  

[Love, universal and profound, is the spiritual foundation of higher-dimensional life.] It is universal love that enables higher-dimensional life to form; it is profound love that compels higher-dimensional life to make difficult, just sacrifices—local compromises for the sake of broader, future love. Bonds of love form naturally between the virtuous; it is their instinct, even their defining trait. Yet in a world rife with hypocrisy and grabbing, even virtuous individuals struggle to connect, for the cost of error is exorbitant. Here, justice must intervene—to cleanse, rebuild trust and reliability, and reawaken love. Where justice thrives, tenderness endures; where justice perishes, tenderness fades.  

Most reasonable people desire a world brimming with love and tenderness, a life of comfort, security, and hope—a gift higher-dimensional life bestows upon its constituent individuals. But this requires justice. Without it, all is illusion. The more you crave "excess love," the more you seek to exploit it, the greater your peril; the harder you cling to "excessive love," the more likely you grasp at PUA lures or fall into Ponzi Scheme traps. We can affirm this: [Only when righteousness fills heaven and earth, when spring winds sweep the land, clouds part, and bright moons rise, can true love endure.]

## Freedom of Higher-Dimensional Life—"My Destiny Is My Own!"  

> The ignorant are least free,  
> For they face  
> A world of total darkness.  
> A nation with those who gaze at stars  
> Has hope.  
> — Hegel  

From the perspective of freedom alone, many organisms seem freer than humans. This hinges on how freedom is defined: as the degree of indulgence in desire, or as the dimension of freedom. If freedom is defined as indulgence, it is hard to say which life is freest; humans may rank below most. The "freest" lives are those embracing "live fast, die young"—species teetering on extinction. In a sense, life resists "freedom" and "chaos."  

But if we redefine freedom—as breadth of capability, depth of experience; as mastery over one’s destiny, the degree of "my fate is mine, not heaven’s"—then human freedom is unparalleled in the living world. Lower-dimensional life, with all its capacities and imagination, cannot fathom even a fraction of human experience.  

Two forms of freedom exist. One belongs to archaea: they thrive in extreme environments, act without constraint, yet cannot see, hear, think, or move with purpose—adrift, precarious, ever at risk of being consumed. The other belongs to humans: we perceive the world’s vastness, dissect life’s eons of diversity, grasp universal laws, and traverse heavens and earth, moon and stars. As the saying goes, "Sparrows know not the swan’s ambition"; the fleeting mayflies, though seemingly free and joyful, cannot comprehend human freedom.  

The "indulgence" of lower-dimensional life is illusory. Freedom between nations, states, clans, family members, spouses, parents and children, siblings—all are contradictory. When one’s "indulgent freedom" swells unchecked, others’ freedoms become obstacles. China’s imperial emperors embodied this paradox: far from absolute freedom, they were ensnared in endless intrigue. "If even one’s spouse and child cannot be trusted, whom can one trust?" Ministers and sovereigns "wage a hundred battles daily." Such freedom is unsustainable, unstable, and cannot enter an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Thus, this "indulgent freedom" is inevitably culled by evolution—repeating its cycle until humanity perishes or awakens to its folly.  

This is evolution’s cruelest truth, yet also its most beautiful design. [Life pursuing the first "freedom"—individual indulgence—is fated to weakness and subjugation, for it chases an eternal paradox: one’s freedom obstructs all others’. Ultimately, freedom becomes the root of unfreedom. This inconsistent freedom is destined for evolutionary discard.]  

["Who demands excessive freedom demands absolute servitude; who demands excessive gain demands extreme exploitation."]  

["Who demands excessive freedom demands absolute servitude; who demands excessive gain demands extreme exploitation."]  

["Who demands excessive freedom demands absolute servitude; who demands excessive gain demands extreme exploitation."]  

Important truths bear repetition. As Lord Acton wrote in *History of Freedom*, [Every age faces four threats to freedom]:

### 1. The Yearning of Strongmen for Power Centralization  
### 2. The Resentment of the Poor toward Wealth Inequality  
### 3. The Longing of the Ignorant for Utopia  
### 4. The Confusion of the Faithless between Freedom and Indulgence  

This is profoundly true. Does this not mean our lives are inherently painful? We cannot fulfill our heart’s desires; we must suppress our inclinations in all things. Is the ideal of absolute freedom for every individual not worth aspiring to, not worth pursuing? In fact, high-dimensional life forms have achieved the pursuit of unrestrained freedom for individuals through an exquisitely clever mechanism: *high-dimensional life forms instill the instinct of love in each individual*. For these individuals, their greatest freedom lies in loving others—they may love freely, and others love them freely in return. By shaping the instincts of individual beings, high-dimensional life forms have made their unrestrained desires self-consistent and harmonious. Within an ideal high-dimensional life form, every internal individual truly attains absolute freedom. For at this point, the freest act for each individual is to ensure the perpetuity of the high-dimensional life form itself. All actions that enhance the well-being of the high-dimensional life form are perceived as aligning with their heart’s desires. The most profound insight is that the “free” actions of each individual and their “goals” are highly unified, harmonious, and self-consistent. This state of “integration” stands in stark contrast to the irreconcilable, unceasingly conflicting “mutual stabbing” of three-dimensional life forms, where the pursuit of individual freedom necessitates enmity with all other three-dimensional beings.  

I revisit Woodrow Wilson’s perspective from *The New Freedom*:  
> “I have long had an image in my mind of what constitutes liberty. Suppose that I were building a great piece of powerful machinery, and suppose that I should so awkwardly and unskilfully assemble the parts of it that every time one part tried to move it would be interfered with by the others, and the whole thing would buckle up and be checked. Liberty for the several parts would consist in the best possible assembling and adjustment of them all, would it not? If you want the great piston of the engine to run with absolute freedom, give it absolutely perfect alignment and adjustment with the other parts of the engine, so that it is free, not because it is let alone or isolated, but because it has been associated most skilfully and carefully with the other parts of the great structure.”  

The human body is such a machine of intricate multicellular cooperation. Without the unity of billions of cells—without their shared fate, their symphonic coordination—human thought could not soar, individual cells could not traverse the heavens or explore the cosmos, and humanity could never have experienced the greatest freedom in the history of life. When you sit calmly in a speeding car, soar through the sky in an airplane, or use a drone to experience flight from a bird’s perspective; when rockets defy Earth’s gravity to reveal cosmic vistas—can a fish fathom such freedom? Can a lion, starving and sleeping 20 hours daily, grasp it? Order eliminates internal friction, freeing humanity to generate unprecedented material and energy resources. These resources, in turn, empower each individual with a freedom incomparable to that of beings trapped in internecine strife.  

This life community, this unified life form, further experiences a cross-dimensional, emergent freedom—one unimaginable to other life forms. It is as if: *the joy of a mayfly’s entire life pales beside a single human moment; the wisdom of a commoner’s lifetime fades before a single instant of civilization*. More crucially, the destiny of this free high-dimensional life form is increasingly in its own hands, no longer adrift with the tides of chance. So long as humanity unites to form a true high-dimensional life form, it may freely reshape the world—moving mountains, reclaiming land from seas, or reaching for the stars—when necessity demands. The vitality of life, its agency, is manifest as never before, driving it toward harmony, beauty, and permanence. A true high-dimensional life form, more than any lower-dimensional existence, has the right to declare: “My fate is mine to command!” This is freedom of will in its truest sense—“will to power,” “self-will,” and “free will” made real.

### High-Dimensional Desires and the Post-Market Economy Era  

In recent years, the term “low-desire society” has gained prominence, coined by Kenichi Ohmae, a renowned Japanese management scholar and economic commentator, in his book. He describes a social phenomenon in Japan where the wealthy refrain from investing or consuming, while young people choose non-marriage, non-childbearing, and non-property ownership—opting instead for “comfortable poverty.” Today, Chinese society is also slipping into a similar state. When wealth stratification solidifies, profitable ventures are saturated, and existing companies sustain themselves without needing financing to expand; when real estate and urban development reach saturation—the economic vitality of such a society plunges into an ice age. The fewer high-dimensional desires a society harbors, the swifter this ice age arrives.  

*The past closed loop of the market economy was primarily designed to cater to humanity’s three-dimensional desires*. In a sense, *the market economy harnessed three-dimensional desires to achieve high-dimensional cooperation*. Yet the limitations and aftereffects of this approach are mounting, with the advent of the low-desire era being one such malady. Consider: historically, the drive to work hard stemmed from the need to satisfy basic needs—food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Thanks to industrial progress, these needs (save for housing in first-tier cities) are largely met. What remains is the pursuit of high-quality mates, yet for many, deception, emotional manipulation, or PUA tactics prove easier than creating value through labor. For profit-seeking capital, the incentive to invest is wealth accumulation. But when low-dimensional needs are satiated, the probability of excess returns on investment plummets. Preserving existing wealth—rather than investing—becomes preferable. Capital is hoarded to hedge against societal upheaval.  

Consumption upgrading might seem a latent demand, yet from a cost-benefit perspective, toiling for marginally better quality at a steep price is unappealing. Thus, consumption upgrading does not align with low-dimensional desires. While vanity and攀比 persist, in a postmodern society where human connections weaken, their tangible benefits dwindle—outweighed by flattery and fraud. Savvy grabbers will inevitably shift toward these tactics.  

Owing to the finiteness of low-dimensional desires, the market economy will stagnate once it matures—a root cause of the middle-income trap (unless severe exploitation and wealth inequality emerge, creating the paradox where inequity paradoxically spurs economic activity). When the cost-benefit ratio of effort to reward is unfavorable, market forces drive individuals to “lie flat” as a strategy for maximizing personal gain. This, in turn, reduces aggregate demand, compelling more to lie flat—a vicious cycle that, as described by Norihiro Sanpu, gives rise to a “downwardly mobile society.”  

*This is an issue inherent to the top-down design of the market economy*.  

A society infused with high-dimensional spirit, however, presents a contrasting picture. Individuals with high-dimensional spirit possess greater curiosity; they embrace novelty without fixating on cost-benefit ratios. They spend on technology out of passion, not utility; they pursue consumption upgrading within their means, driven by a love of beauty, not rational cost-efficiency. They even care about cosmic frontiers they may never reach. *From the perspective of three-dimensional individuals, they appear “foolish” or “clumsy,” lacking shrewdness. Yet it is precisely their passion—transcending low-dimensional needs—that propels the market economy into a positive cycle, driving scientific, technological, and cultural progress rather than stagnation*.  

We observe two major bubbles in the global economy today: China’s housing market and U.S. tech stocks. The U.S. tech stock bubble rivals China’s housing bubble in scale. These behemoth stocks, with market capitalizations exceeding nations’ GDPs, often have price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios above 30—far higher than the single-digit to teens P/E of smaller Chinese counterparts. Promising U.S. stocks can even command P/E ratios of 100–200. Countless unprofitable companies survive solely on stock valuations.

On one side lies the housing price bubble, and on the other, the high-tech stock bubble. To three-dimensional life forms, these may seem like risks of the same nature. However, from the perspective of high-dimensional life, investments in high technology serve the long-term interests of high-dimensional life—though such investments are difficult to monetize in the short term—whereas the housing price bubble lacks such utility. [High-dimensional desires, high-dimensional ideals, and high-dimensional instincts are the ultimate factors driving a society’s economy into positive feedback. The foundation underpinning these is not market logic, but the instincts of high-dimensional life. This is the primary driving force ensuring the enduring vitality of market economies.] Only societies where the instinct to love science and take greater risks in technological investment prevails—rather than those where capital is allocated to industries like liquor with hyper-rational calculations—stand a chance of escaping the middle-income trap. In a sense, this instinct defies market laws and the principle of maximizing individual short-term interests. [The fundamental source of economic momentum is demand, is desire.] Three-dimensional desires are shallow and easily satisfied. A lack of desire and demand is terrifying, as it would stall the snowball effect of market economies. By contrast, the desires spawned by the ascension of life’s dimensionality are boundless, driving humanity ever forward.  

What would happen if desires ascend dimensionally? We would not only wish for our own well-being but also for the well-being of our children, grandchildren, and future generations. Beyond our own descendants, we would care for the descendants of others. This would lead us to pursue a better natural environment, a fairer and more just social environment, and ways to avoid grabbing, cancerization, and corruption—desires far more arduous to fulfill than three-dimensional ones. We might even extend our concerns to all life on Earth, seeking to improve their environments and build more amicable connections with them. Initiatives like carbon neutrality and SpaceX are quintessential examples of high-dimensional desires. As long as desires evolve in this direction, the engine of the market economy will spin faster, grow larger, and run without end. Only under the impetus of endless desires can we achieve endless innovation, breakthroughs, and emergence. If high-dimensional desires fail to move us, the optimal choice will always be to live in comfort and "lie flat" at home. Thus, whether we admit it or not, the true future belongs to those who can ignite high-dimensional desires. At this point, such desires are no longer called "desires" but "ideals," and ideals demand boundless effort to realize. Those who fail to cultivate high-dimensional desires may face extinction through successive generations of apathy.  

Additionally, there is an intriguing phenomenon I have yet to fully explain. [High-dimensional desires often drive people through feelings of happiness, joy, contentment, achievement, and honor. Low-dimensional desires, by contrast, typically compel action through fear, hunger, pressure, and anxiety.] For instance, low-dimensional life instills fear of death to ensure survival; it induces hunger to secure energy for life; it fuels sexual appetite to propagate the species. In comparison, high-dimensional life encourages exploration of the universe’s laws by rewarding the pursuit of knowledge with satisfaction; it fosters camaraderie by bestowing the joy of friendship; it strengthens male-female cooperation by gifting the sweetness of love and the pleasure of regular intimacy; and it motivates contributions to the collective by granting a sense of achievement and honor when benefiting the masses. [Individuals with high-dimensional instincts indeed possess far greater potential for happiness and fulfillment than those without.] When these high-dimensional desires are fully activated—especially when individuals receive widespread, heartfelt recognition, approval, and affection from their communities—[when they are certain their actions benefit the collective, they are infused with a profound sense of belonging, achievement, purpose, responsibility, and honor, feeling an unshakable "it must be me" resolve. Conversely, societies mired in low-dimensional desires are rife with deception, resentment of the capable, fraud, and exploitation. In these societies, daily life revolves around internal competition, short-sightedness, suspicion, and mutual undermining. The greatest efficiency gains in such societies stem from reducing the inefficiencies caused by fraud, suspicion, and internal strife; resolving these issues would allow humanity to effortlessly reignite productivity, rather than sinking deeper into fruitless toil.]  

[Perhaps no one has truly imagined the enormous economic potential and positive feedback loops that high-dimensional morality and high-dimensional ideals can generate. When these high-dimensional instincts are genuinely activated, forming widespread demand, they drive industries, generate cooperative dividends, benefit all individuals, and in turn strengthen confidence and spawn more high-dimensional demands. The economic wheel will then spin without pause. Our exploration of the cosmos is not for filling empty stomachs; our dissection of the natural world is not for personal gain; our pursuit of high-dimensional art and culture will know no bounds.] This is the most fundamental path to breaking free from a low-desire society.  


## Transcending Death  
Death marks the end of three-dimensional life, and some even view it as the end of all meaning and purpose. The saying "After death, all is naught" reflects this—people often regard death as life’s final punctuation. This perspective has been reinforced as scientific inquiry has dismantled religious "fictions" like heaven, the afterlife, and reincarnation. Modern catchphrases now echo: "Human life is but once; we should..." and "We come with nothing and leave with nothing; we should..." Under such influence, I was deeply grieved by my father’s passing. He faced death with serenity, never burdening his family, and worked diligently until his last breath, contributing to society and his descendants without reaping much personal reward. If life is but a single chance, his sacrifice for me and our family felt like a squandered opportunity. This thought still fills me with sorrow.  

### "Yesterday’s Self Has Died"—You Cannot Step into the Same River Twice as the Same Person  
Driven by this grief, I delved into the question: What does death mean for life? The Greek philosopher Heraclitus posited, "No man ever steps in the same river twice." As a child, this proposition filled me with pessimism. Its logic is unassailable, deepening my unease—it suggests that no encounter with the world is ever truly repeated. [At its extreme, this view leads to nihilism: all things are transient, lacking order, permanence, or reliability.]  

Similar to Heraclitus’ river is the parable of Theseus’ Ship. It describes a ship that sails for centuries, its rotting planks and components replaced one by one until none of the original parts remain. The question arises: Is the final ship still Theseus’ Ship, or a completely new one?  

<div align="center">
  <img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d57992e-3090-4402-8ed0-bea81514890b" />
</div>  

The conclusion "You cannot step into the same river twice" is not the most disconcerting. Extending this logic leads to a more heartbreaking realization: "He who steps into the same river twice cannot be the same person."—even our own existence becomes suspect. Modern science aligns with the metaphor of Theseus’ Ship. [Human cells die and regenerate constantly.] Red blood cells renew every four months; white blood cells, every 20 days; liver cells, every five months. Most human cells are replaced within half a year. Our bodies are literal Theseus’ Ships: the "me" of now is not the "me" of the past, let alone the "me" of the future. If we slice time into discrete moments and imagine all cells replaced instantaneously, what justifies calling the "me" of one moment the same as the "me" of the next? If matter is the sole carrier of existence, strictly speaking, we are "emptied," "replaced," and "die" every moment. What, then, is "I"? Where does "I" go?  

As a teenager, the fear of material death haunted me. For a time, I even feared sleeping, worried that waking the next day would mean a new "me." I frantically tried to memorize every detail of the present to prove continuity, often berating myself for poor memory. I dreaded losing memories, fearing that would erase my past self. Though my instincts resisted this view, my scientific reasoning found no grounds to refute the idea that material death and replacement cause individual extinction.  

This question has long been debated in philosophy under the rubric of "personal identity." Classic theories include animalism, soul theory, brain theory, memory theory, psychological continuity theory, nonbranching theory, closest continuer theory, and space-time worm theory. For curious readers, these merit study. Yet upon deeper examination, all these theories contain flaws, failing to provide satisfying answers.

In his novel *Siddhartha*, Hermann Hesse also conveys a similar insight through his protagonist: "This river flows, flows ceaselessly, yet it is always here. It is the same at every moment, yet new in each instant!" Hesse seems to advise living in the present, unshackled by the past or future—a notion consonant with Buddhism's emphasis on releasing attachments and embracing life with equanimity. This perspective is salutary, akin to a painkiller or lullaby for life, restoring it to a healthy rhythm. Yet it cannot serve as the ultimate answer to life's riddles; overreliance may even harm life itself.  

### How Transience Weaves Eternity; How Nothingness Begets Meaning  
In truth, the "self" is but a consciousness construct "fabricated" by genes to achieve perpetuity—perhaps the self has never existed in a rigorous sense. If the self is a false premise, the unity of personality is even more so. To truly understand the self and transcend the fear of death, we must return to the genetic perspective. My clarity on this matter came only after revisiting computer programming. I realized that so-called "data, software, and algorithms" can reside in diverse physical carriers: hard disks, CDs, solid-state drives, or RAM. A single image, for instance, exists as entirely different physical states across these carriers, yet software can reproduce it identically. The same applies to software and algorithms: even when running on distinct hardware—CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs—they are not deemed different entities. Computer science masterfully abstracts hardware, enabling data, software, and algorithms to exist stably in "digital form" above the material plane.  

[For the first time, I grasped that things can exist beyond the physical world.] These data, software, and algorithms transcend matter, enduring in forms far more permanent and stable than the material itself. Delving deeper, we find that life invented the technology of weaving eternity first: DNA, an abstract "data carrier" devised by life eons ago, has persisted in its abstract form for billions of years. The *Dimension Ascension* centered on DNA is life's ultimate purpose—guarding eternity. All life's vicissitudes, joys, and sorrows, from humans to other organisms, revolve around this goal.  

[Human genes, memories, ethos, and souls exist in precisely this transcendent form. They forge terrifying stability amid the flux of the physical world, resist entropy within chaotic systems, and construct order and meaning from objective nothingness. As living beings, we are not defined by matter but by genes, ethos, and soul. Otherwise, we would have perished yesterday. Even the matter composing genes and DNA is inherently unstable. Across infinite time and space, only DNA sequences and the behavioral paradigms of proteins translated via life's central dogma—like abstract algorithms—remain stable.]  

Let us design a simple thought experiment. Imagine two scenarios involving people you know well. In the first, a person retains their appearance and memories but undergoes a complete transformation in temperament, worldview, values, and conduct—even turning from kind to cruel. In the second, a person loses their appearance and memories but retains the same tone of voice, temperament, values, worldview, and conduct. Initially, you might feel the first person remains "the same," but over time, you would grow estranged, eventually seeing them as a stranger. The second, however, would feel unfamiliar at first; yet through prolonged interaction, their mannerisms would evoke a long-lost familiarity, recalling the person before the change. Which of these two would you consider to have "truly" died?  

[Life, in essence, exists as an abstract form: genes, paradigms, spirit, and ethos. Because it transcends matter, it overcomes material limitations—finitude, instability—and spans time and space to form a grand, unified "self." By transcending material form, it may align with the cosmic order and universal laws.]  

### Transcending the Small Self Transcends Death—The River of Life Flows On  
Grasping this, the river we never cross twice, the places we never revisit, the people we cannot bear to part with—all return, reanimated in our hearts. They transition from transience to eternity, from matter to spirit. Poetry finds its home; digits attain life. Idealism and materialism converge; matter and spirit transform. My sorrow turns to joy.  

If understanding remains confined to the material, life is the world's most pitiable creature—fleeting, fragile. Even by the most lenient standards of resilience, life's material finitude holds: we arrive with nothing, depart with nothing. Such a view of life breeds dread of death. For those who believe life is singular, unfulfilled joy renders existence a waste. This begets another nihilism: rejecting struggle, meaning, and ambition—seeking only to delay death. Yet matter cannot achieve immortality. When faced with death's inevitability, they remain terrified.  

In contrast, those who grasp the essence of high-dimensional life face natural death with equanimity. When an individual's expectation of taking from the symbiotic life whole exceeds their expectation of giving, they naturally approach death. *The Unselfish Gene: Reexamining the Boundaries of Life and Death*, a work aligning with this book's thesis, argues that rhythmic death is a product of group selection, preserving population control and genetic diversity. Natural death is an honor, a rebirth, and an eternity. Like cherry blossoms that bloom brilliantly then fall without hesitation, or the billions of cells in our bodies that apoptose periodically and orderly, death follows life's rhythm.  

This must be distinguished from Japan's distorted bushido. Bushido glorifies unhesitant, unregretful death—but this is erroneous. Apoptosis is natural and just only when an individual's take from the life whole exceeds their give. When bushido is perverted into morally coerced, fanatical suicide, it loses its validity. For high-dimensional life, programmed individual death is the least cause for concern; metabolism is its most fundamental activity. Death, as a vital rhythm, is part of high-dimensional life itself.  

Rabindranath Tagore held profound insights into death:  
> "Life as a whole never takes death seriously. Before death, it laughs, dances, and plays; it builds, hoards, and loves. We perceive death's emptiness and grow despondent only when we isolate individual death from life's totality. We forget that death is but a part of life, like viewing a cloth under a microscope—what appears as a net of holes makes us tremble with imagination. Yet death is not ultimate reality; it seems dark as the sky seems blue, but death is no blackened entity, just as the sky leaves no color on a bird's wings."  
>  
> "When the boundary between the finite and infinite is transcended, the opposition between life and death dissolves. In the state of enlightenment, one no longer perceives personal death as the end of life.  
>  
> One has lived through endless pasts and will live through endless futures."—*The Religion of Man*  

[This is the river of life, flowing ceaselessly.] In his final days, my father strived to do more for his family, especially for me. Knowing his capacity was limited, he did not cling to life. Though our family was financially secure, he hid his ailments, living frugally. The adage "a bad life is better than a good death" held no sway for him; instead, he viewed his passing as his last contribution to the high-dimensional life whole, upholding the dignity he cherished.  

These days, I dream of my late father. In the dream, I return to childhood, following him along a winding path. No matter the twists or slopes, I feel safe and at peace. Finally, he stops, stands aside, and looks at me with love. Though I cannot hear his words, I know he cannot walk further with me, nor does he want me to wait. From now on, I must lead, as he once led me, guiding those who follow.

Since I grasped the mystery of how higher-dimensional life confronts individual death, my grief over my father’s passing has softened. Instead, I feel a deeper resolve to carry forward his genes, virtues, and spirit. If you feel indebted to someone but cannot repay them directly, do not dwell on regret. You may extend your gratitude to those who share similar temperaments, characters, or resemblances—this is recompense to the lineage of beauty, and they will receive it. When you meet someone and feel an instant kinship, as if reuniting with a long-lost acquaintance, it may signify a karmic bond from past existences.  

In the distant future, if there are still readers who open this book, flipping through its pages as if reading their own words, then my life, genes, and soul will have achieved de facto continuity. Even now, the sense of trans-temporal resonance with my future and past selves has made me feel whole, akin to the experience of tens of thousands joining in a chorus of Beyond’s *Boundless Sky and Vast Earth*: we all become黄家驹 (Wong Ka Kui) in that moment, and as he sang, he too might have felt himself becoming each individual resonating with his music.  

> “Still free and self-willed, forever singing my song, traversing a thousand miles. (I will do what I believe is right)  
> Forgive me for my unruly love of freedom in this life. (Forgive me for the hurt caused to others in pursuing my ideals)  
> I may fear stumbling one day. (Even if I fall because of this)  
> Betraying ideals—anyone can do it. (Others may betray their ideals, but I cannot)  
> I need not fear a day when only you and I remain. (Even if only you and I are left in the world, I will not abandon this dream)”  

Perhaps the most fundamental identity in all personal continuity is Virtue itself. Virtue is a recursive, wondrous, and reassuring concept—so long as Virtue remains consistent, other differences can be accommodated. For Virtue vastly increases the probability of reconstructing all that is beautiful. This is truly a remarkable mathematical insight.  

### Ascension Is the Only Solution to Fundamental Contradictions  
Having resolved the question of death, I further realized that a chain of other ultimate philosophical dilemmas would thereby be addressed. The evolutionary struggle for existence among three-dimensional life has inscribed a sense of “self” into our genes—a transitional state necessary for dimensional ascension, yet not its final form. Buddhism astutely identifies this self-consciousness as the root of human suffering. Buddhism posits that humans are aggregates of the Five Skandhas (form, sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness). The *rupa skandha* (form) refers to the physical body; *vedana skandha* (sensation) to feelings; *sanjna skandha* (perception) to thoughts and concepts; *samskara skandha* (volition) to intentional actions; and *vijnana skandha* (consciousness) to awareness. These elements interdepend, interact, and perpetually change—there is no independent, unchanging, or sovereign “self.” For example, the body ages over time, while sensations and thoughts are in constant flux; there is no eternal “I” governing all. Attachment to a fixed self gives rise to cravings, aversions, and delusions—greed for wealth, envy of others, and so on, all rooted in clinging to self-interest or reputation. Buddhism teaches that recognizing the absence of a permanent self (anatta) reduces such afflictions, leading to inner peace and liberation.  

In reality, pursuing a literal “no-self” state is difficult and risks descending into nihilism, even zombification. Three-dimensional desires and higher-dimensional desires are not fundamentally opposed; they are more akin to sublimation and inheritance. What matters is expanding the Five Skandhas into a greater “self”—retaining moderate lower-dimensional desires while cultivating intense higher-dimensional desires, such that the latter can overshadow the former when necessary. When humanity’s higher-dimensional consciousness awakens, individualism fades, and true human subjectivity and divinity are established. Only then can the fetters, suffering, and fundamental contradictions imposed by narrow, localized individualism be transcended. Parfit’s Non-Identity Paradox finds resolution here. Existential struggles, where each person fights to assert their subjectivity by reducing others to objects—through Medusa-like gazes that turn others into mere objects of consciousness, seeking to render them subservient—are dissolved. The tragedy of “the other is hell” is averted. The Hobbesian Jungle transforms into civilization. The free will of self and other are mutually satisfied. The justice of *The Republic* is realized. The world’s ultimate nihilism is dispelled.  

Of course, completing this process requires a metamorphosis akin to the Cambrian explosion—one that surpasses it. This metamorphosis demands the regression of all grabbing instincts and “organs” inherited from two-dimensional life. Here, self and other merge, sharing human subjectivity and dignity; life returns to its essence, purged of the filth and hypocrisy of involution. This is a unified beauty, mathematical beauty, ultimate beauty. More marvelously, no matter how small we are as individuals, this unified subject endows us with unprecedented confidence and strength: the strength of faith, of conquering fear and overcoming weakness, of unwavering certainty, of being supported by countless unseen hands, of unyielding, pure, and resolute purpose.  

### The Origin of Higher-Dimensional Self-Consciousness  
To truly feel this continuity and strength, one must first possess the instinct to perceive a greater “self-consciousness.” Why does a human body, composed of tens of trillions of independent cells, give rise to a singular self-consciousness? Why do we regard our hands and feet as “ours”? Fundamentally, we are a loose community of two-dimensional life—eukaryotic cells. What unites us into a singular “I”?  

To understand, we need only revisit the evolutionary history of life from the perspective of single-celled prokaryotes. Humanity began as a prokaryote called “Archaeon *Archaeoscopus*,” just 1–10 micrometers in size. We then formed a landmark partnership with the ancestor of mitochondria, merging into eukaryotes—far more complex and larger than prokaryotes. Now, “I” became this eukaryotic organism, containing thousands of mitochondria once foreign to “me,” growing to 30–50 micrometers in diameter—10 to 1,000 times larger in volume.  

After eons, following the Cambrian explosion, countless eukaryotic cells formed tight cooperatives, and “I” became the multicellular eukaryote *Myllokunmingia*. Over 500 million more years of evolution, “I” became a primate. Now, “I” comprises 40–60 trillion eukaryotic cells once alien to “me,” with my volume increased by tens of trillions of times. As an individual, “I” now ages and loses cells by the millions daily. Yet “I” feel no fear or attachment, for the whole remains vital. Lost cells are mere metabolic turnover or programmed apoptosis for the greater good.  

What unites countless independent life forms of the previous dimension into a shared “self-consciousness,” forming a unified life of the next dimension? It is *bonds*, love in the broadest sense. A community of loving two-dimensional life forms evolves into three-dimensional life, birthing self-consciousness—a phenomenon so universal it is taken for granted. If two-dimensional life achieved this, three-dimensional life can do the same.  

This capacity for empathy and resonance stems from the primal force of Adversarial Evolution, the engine of dimensional ascension, the source of cosmic order. It is wondrous that some, degraded by Grabbingism, lose this capacity for love, dismissing it as a lie. But observe the profound strength of most women upon becoming mothers—placing their child’s life above their own. The possibility of human unity is self-evident.  

Though suspicion, defensiveness, PUA, and moral coercion erode this higher-dimensional life force—diminishing it, suppressing it with self-protective mechanisms, burying it beneath survival fears—it persists. Otherwise, humanity would devolve into non-human animals, the weakest and least adaptable in nature, doomed to extinction. Thus, I believe that once humanity recognizes that deeper connection is life’s ultimate destination, its inevitable path, we will marshal our highest wisdom to eliminate all hypocrisy, involution, scheming, and moral coercion that hinder this process.  

In contrast, evil, hypocritical, self-centered, and disconnected souls remain forever lonely, unable to feel this unity. They are condemned to envy, hatred, and exclusion—cosmic order’s ultimate punishment and elimination mechanism.  

This resonance and empathy are the cosmic order’s gift to humanity, a nascent higher-dimensional life form, granting the secret of transcending individual death and attaining immortality. This is not religion, not idealism, but the inevitable conclusion of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension theory pushed to its limits—just as it endowed three-dimensional life, including all higher animals, with self-consciousness, it will surely bestow “self-consciousness” upon four-dimensional and higher-dimensional life.  

Here, science and theology converge; humanity and divinity merge; idealism and materialism unify.

The assertion that "human life is but once" is patently arbitrary, even ignorant. Consider the cells in our bodies—each as an individual entity has a fleeting existence. Yet we do not perceive their metabolic processes as a "death" marked by sorrow, pain, or regret. A similar perspective once existed in early human societies: during the most vibrant period of ancient Rome, the elderly approached death with extraordinary calm. After bequeathing their wealth to adopted children or donating it to society, many chose to die by voluntary fasting. When we recognize that we shall one day live anew in a more beautiful era, experiencing all that this age has never known—or at the very least, have strived to bring such an era into being—the physical death of the body becomes no different from a brief slumber. Placing ourselves within the framework of High-Dimensional Life, like a drop of water merging into a great river, we cease to sigh or grieve over death. For in this context, death does not exist; Virtue cycles here. This is a life experience that low-dimensional beings who think "let the flood come after I die" can never fathom or imagine. If life is an experience, then the experience of merging into High-Dimensional existence—transcending the individual, spanning vast time and space, and contemplating boundless wisdom and ages—is the most wondrous and meaningful of all.  

When we quiet our minds, we can perceive the rhythmic pulse of the world's life force. Begin with your own heart, sensing its connection to the five internal organs; then to the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth; then to the hands, feet, and hair. Extend this awareness outward: feel your links to others—to lovers, parents, children, and kin; then to ancestors of the past and descendants of the future; to forebears who forged ahead through history's trials; to national heroes who turned the tide in crises. Expand further: connect with all kind-hearted strangers, regardless of nationality or skin color. Continue spreading this awareness to all species in humanity's symbiotic biosphere—cats, dogs, chickens, cattle, sheep; rice, millet, sorghum, wheat, beans; and even the flowers, grass, birds, and insects that sustain ecological balance and air purity. This connection stretches endlessly, flowing across mountains and plains, oceans and deserts, peaks and valleys, through seas of clouds, traversing spring, summer, autumn, and winter, past and future. If we attune ourselves, we can sense this link—faint as gossamer, seeming to exist yet not—but the more we believe in it, the clearer and stronger it becomes. It weaves through the Earth's living beings like nerve fibers, part of our very bodies.  

Hand in hand, we stand atop lofty mountains and vast seas, laughing at light-years, holding galaxies within our grasp. Heart to heart, we flow through past and future, defying reincarnation, storing eternity in moments. There exists a joy greater than all else, even conquering death: *to seek the Way at dawn and die content at dusk*. [This is no different from the formation of 3-dimensional life, which comprises independent low-dimensional lives linked by nerves (a broad sense of love) to achieve dimensional ascension. High-Dimensional Life achieves this elevation through love in its narrower sense.]  

Humankind universally harbors the potential for religious belief—a potential prepared for High-Dimensional Awakening. Those who never achieve such awakening, who cannot merge into the symbiotic system of High-Dimensional Life, are fated to be marginalized, abandoned, and gradually perish. For High-Dimensionally awakened beings, the greatest terror is *rejection reaction*—a [Disconnected State] where all around are "strangers." Conversely, they are incomparably powerful. To true High-Dimensional Life, when you can trust those around without reservation, if your eyes fail, others become your eyes; if your ears fail, others become your ears. You will not be abandoned or forgotten. Your life flows not only within yourself but also within your loved ones, compatriots, and all healthy, Virtue-upholding individuals. Facing hardship, you feel no powerlessness—your strength springs from yourself and every individual connected to this High-Dimensional being. You become a "giant" or "superman" who stands tall, spans vast distances, and commands the elements.  

[Is there a moment when you have felt this mighty will of High-Dimensional Life—a will so powerful it compels you to stand in tears, to revere, to worship? "It is the grandeur of distant mountains; the vastness of the sea; the brilliance of stars; the flow of great rivers." It makes you unhesitatingly surrender all to it, submit to it, merge into it, become it—"the cosmos is my heart; my heart is the cosmos."]  

With this certainty, facing绝境, "though a thousand oppose, I go forth with a smile" becomes natural confidence. This is not "individual heroism," but "collective individual heroism"—Symbiotic Communitarianism. When truly linked to all life, you experience emergent, trans-dimensional cognition, perceiving details, horizons, and cosmic phenomena far beyond the reach of your senses. You love every inch of "your" body, and every inch of "your" body loves you as an individual. As an individual, you face death with perfect calm—for it is but the normal rhythm of the vast, great "you" of life, a harmless, beneficial metabolism. To regard death as returning home is like a water drop dissolving entirely into the boundless sea. Your thoughts, emotions, values, and genes have long spread through life's connections. Your will, demeanor, and body will be reborn again and again across time and space. You are the same person with identical identity, living in the present, the past, and the future. So long as High-Dimensional Life endures and the mighty will persists, you are immortal.
