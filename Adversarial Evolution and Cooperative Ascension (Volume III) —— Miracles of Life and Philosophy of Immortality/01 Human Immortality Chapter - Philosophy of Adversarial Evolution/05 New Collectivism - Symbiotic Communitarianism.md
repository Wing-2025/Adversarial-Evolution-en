# New Collectivism – Symbiotic Communitarianism

## Thinking About One’s Interests Like High-Dimensional Life

Earlier, we defined virtue and justice as ["actions beneficial to the long-term interests of the community as a whole"](). Upon reading this definition, some friends who are acquainted with the histories of utopian ideals, religions, utopianism, and social contract theory but have not fully grasped the core ideas of this book might exclaim: Is this not just the oldest cliché of collectivism in human society? Yet when has collectivist systems ever achieved true success? Are the tragedies of the French Revolution, the failures of utopian experiments, and the lessons from the collapse of the former Soviet Union 30 years ago not painful enough? Among these, there are even more than a few cult organizations that take collectivism as their doctrine. Hayek referred to this series of ideological trends as the "fatal conceit." The crux of the problem, therefore, lies in the interpretation of this statement. In particular, when one forcefully links so-called universal values like equality and freedom to collectivism, it becomes easy to fall into erroneous value judgments. Malicious individuals may then exploit such value judgments to mislead and morally coerce others. [I dare say that nearly all fallacies of purely purposeful collectivist ideologies in human society stem from a shallow understanding of the definition "beneficial to the long-term interests of the collective"; while nearly all other fallacies in human society result from the failure to properly implement genuine collectivism.]()

To fully comprehend the phrase "actions beneficial to the long-term interests of the community as a whole," one must first focus on understanding what "long-term" represents and what "interests" refer to. Here, "long-term" does not denote immediate or short-sighted interests. The "interests" mentioned here pertain to the interests of the community’s genes—actions that are beneficial to the genes capable of long-term survival—not the present-day happiness of each individual. To clarify this issue, two key distinctions must be understood:  
1. The distinction between being beneficial to the current collective interests and being beneficial to the long-term collective interests.  
2. The distinction between the collective genetic interests and collective desires (there are rare instances where realizing genetic interests and satisfying collective desires or collective happiness run counter to one another).  

[Although this statement is simple, the inclusion of the term "long-term" renders it complex and uncertain.]() Yet this is precisely the challenge humanity currently faces and must overcome, placing new demands on human intelligence, institutions, and innovative capacity. [Essentially, it also requires humanity to truly ascend to a higher dimension in thinking about the question of "oneself."]() Momentary prosperity for humanity is easy to achieve, but without resolving these issues, great decline and tragedy will be inflicted during the extended period of civilization.  

There is a fallacious yet often politically correct notion: the belief that the world will become better if everyone simply acts for the good of others, or if technological progress infinitely satisfies everyone’s needs. This is the fundamental reason why many political systems ultimately encounter problems. Such a world may seem idyllic, but it will quickly collapse—it is a world most beloved by cancer cells, whose desires are insatiable, and no technology can ever fully satiate them. Like the Roman Empire in its heyday, which could not sustain the corruption of Rome even with the wealth siphoned from half the world. Must we then endure asceticism daily to sustain it? If so, it would be better to let the world collapse.  

In fact, the laws of cosmic life have already designed an ideal path for us—one that is extremely close to the aforementioned "everyone’s happiness" path but can enter an evolutionary steady state and achieve sustainability. This is also the grand trend that Earth’s life world has been advancing for billions of years of evolution—enabling all to live happily, except for degenerate grabbers. [Neither Athenian direct democracy nor Rousseau’s idea of surrendering individual rights is feasible. Without sound institutions and virtuous peers, no one truly cares about others’ rights. To put it cruelly, nature grants no rights, and humans are not inherently endowed with rights. Rights are a product of human nature and collective virtue. Past collectivist ideologies were overly simplistic and naive; we need to establish a new collectivism, which I term Symbiotic Communitarianism. Symbiotic Communitarianism, in essence, involves thinking about one’s long-term interests like high-dimensional life forms.]()  

In the past, people assumed that genes only act in the interests of individuals, but this greatly underestimates nature’s "wisdom." The "wisdom" with which genes calculate for the long-term interests of their kin is something humanity has only just begun to recognize. The distinct difference between Symbiotic Communitarianism and traditional collectivism lies in its greater focus on evolutionary trends and evolutionary gains, rather than absolute fairness and equality. A correct collectivist perspective is more akin to a hybrid and organic integration of collectivism and individualism. However, are collectivism and individualism not opposing and contradictory worldviews? Can they truly coexist harmoniously?  

Traditional collectivism often entails two principles:  
1. Collective interests supersede all else; individuals should sacrifice everything for the collective.  
2. Resource allocation among individuals should be as fair and equal as possible.  

Individualism, on the other hand, often involves two principles that seem diametrically opposed to collectivism:  
1. Individual interests are of paramount importance; let competition determine survival of the fittest.  
2. Nearly all human achievements stem from capable individuals; such individuals should receive increased rewards and resources to enable them to make greater contributions and gain more genetic opportunities.  

In what follows, I will demonstrate that these four principles are fundamentally non-contradictory, compatible, and mutually reinforcing, thereby revealing the framework of genuine collectivism.  

## Is It Desirable to Sacrifice Individual Interests for Collective Interests?  

If we do not think deeply enough, we may sometimes arrive at conclusions that seem reasonable but are potentially erroneous. For example, we have consistently argued that humanity is the winner of group competition—does this mean we should always sacrifice individual interests for collective interests, or that we should avoid competition among individuals? [Such errors often stem from short-sighted perspectives that fail to consider issues from an evolutionary and long-term standpoint.]()  

On one hand, from an evolutionary perspective, the expected value of a virtuous individual’s contribution to collective interests is extremely high, particularly due to the genetic propagation effect of their offspring, who are more likely to be virtuous. The short-term gains from their sacrifice must be objectively compared with the long-term gains of propagating such virtuous genes. On the other hand, the question of "which collective’s interests" must be carefully considered. For instance, if cancer cells already constitute the majority of a collective and virtuous individuals are nearly extinct, sacrificing oneself for such a collective would indirectly accelerate the spread of cancer cells, potentially even contributing negatively to the collective’s long-term interests.  

Regarding competition among individuals, I have previously likened human groups to a human body to illustrate the futility of infighting. However, this analogy was solely for the purpose of helping understand the drawbacks of excessive emphasis on individualism and is inaccurate. In the long term, unreservedly sacrificing individuals for the collective would only lead to the state of superorganisms like ants and bees, not the more unique and rare form of humanity. Humanity is a species that has enjoyed unparalleled group advantages from cooperation while [retaining the evolutionary acceleration and anti-cancer properties derived from individual competition. (Indeed, internal competition is a highly sophisticated anti-cancer mechanism, and anti-cancer efforts are precisely the most critical actions for collective long-term interests.)]()  

[The evolutionary benefits that virtuous and outstanding individuals bring to the collective often far exceed the limited benefits that such individuals could create by sacrificing themselves in the present.]() For example, if a good person like Lei Feng could balance doing good deeds with maintaining personal health and leave more virtuous descendants for future generations, the evolutionary value he creates would surpass the value of burning himself out prematurely for the collective. The long-term benefits of his gene for courageously sacrificing are immense and incalculable. Sacrifice only yields genuine long-term benefits when it occurs at the right moment, such as Huang Jiguang’s sacrifice—only in such necessary and critical moments is sacrifice required. This is the eruption of high-dimensional vitality, the blooming of pure high-dimensional connections, an unyielding, cherry-blossom-like, and splendid conclusion akin to ants forming a cluster to escape a fire.  

Of course, considering the era’s need for the Lei Feng spirit, his sacrifice also generated positive and significant long-term benefits for the collective, but this is premised on not arbitrarily exploiting such a spirit for moral coercion. [We must never overlook that an individual’s contribution to the collective often manifests in the propagation of virtuous genes.]()  

We now have a clear criterion to determine which decision is more desirable—[that is, in the long term, whichever choice is more conducive to the collective’s virtue enhancement, de-cancerization, emergence of capabilities, and generation of cooperative dividends is generally more beneficial to the collective, rather than simply assuming that sacrificing individual interests to obtain short-term excess gains for the collective is correct.]() [Therefore, blindly sacrificing individual interests to fulfill the collective’s short-term interests is often undesirable and even harmful to the collective’s long-term interests.]()  

## Vigilance Against Cooperation Evolving from Symbiosis to Parasitism

Both collectivism and individualism contain positive elements. Individualism, under certain circumstances and in a specific sense, can even be a more far-sighted form of collectivism. Why is this the case? We often fall into a misunderstanding: that allocating the same resources equally to two individuals and having them collaborate to solve a problem will necessarily yield better results than assigning those resources to a single individual. A more general formulation of this misunderstanding is the belief that two individuals working in seamless cooperation will always create greater value with the same resources than a single individual. This is an erroneous perception—one that requires clarification even after the book’s overarching emphasis on the Law of Cooperative Dividend.  

Unwavering cooperation indubitably generates dividends, whose potential even follows a power-law growth pattern, with their value emerging as an emergent property. However, this process is inseparable from the extreme self-optimization of each individual participating in the cooperation. The realization of individual value, the maximal exertion of individual capabilities, pushing each "core" to perform at its peak, and granting exceptional individuals excessive allocation of immediate benefits—especially genetic benefits—are precisely what genuine collectivism demands. If collectivism instead fixates on egalitarianism; morally coerces individuals in the name of collective interests; allows free-riders to repeatedly profit; lets grabbing parasites siphon resources; and exhausts those who make primary contributions—*such collectivism will only breed deep-seated revulsion, incur irreversible losses to the collective’s long-term and authentic interests, and may even prove inferior to the extreme individualism of non-cooperation*.  

The 1980s TV drama *A Place Far from the Crowd* poignantly illustrates the flaws of this narrow, superficial collectivism—flaws that continue to recur in reality. The *Eupatorium adenophorum* repeatedly mentioned in the drama metaphorically underscores the peril of parasitic, cancerized individuals.  

Furthermore, while cooperation holds immense potential, forcing superficial collaboration atop flawed mechanisms and the innate propensities of human evil often backfires. It may spawn parasitism rather than symbiosis. Symbiotic Communitarianism emphasizes maximizing each individual’s value, mutual assistance, and seamless integration; yet within this state, some individuals in the symbiotic whole may easily degenerate into parasitic, cancerized entities. In the long term, such "cooperation"—born of good intentions—can fatally harm the collective. Drawing appropriate boundaries may actually enhance cooperation and the generation of cooperative dividends. Fundamentally, improving mechanisms and shaping human nature to cultivate a "cooperative environment" is the most urgent and essential task.  

On the other hand, we encourage—and even require—individuals to take responsibility for themselves and consider the billions of "fellow beings" within their own bodies. If a person lacks the capacity for self-aware self-interest, they are unfit to construct four-dimensional life forms. Thus, our desires for fine food, comfortable homes, moderate material indulgences, love, and physical health are not merely three-dimensional urges but also high-dimensional aspirations and the very desires of collectivism.  

"Gentlemanly," "Spring and Autumn ritual-style" competition between individuals, groups, and super-groups is also to be encouraged. This is fundamentally a form of Non-grabbing Competition. We should wholeheartedly commend and bless the winners of non-grabbing, non-cheating competition, increasing the likelihood of their genetic inheritance—a process that carries forward our own genes. Losers in competition should not be mocked or scorned. If they accept defeat gracefully, remaining calm in loss, they embody a supreme virtue of high-dimensional life and represent a revered genetic form. Excessive reverence for a small subset of competition winners risks falling into Rule Overfitting, eroding diversity and Robustness, and bringing disaster to the collective—this is also unwise.  

Focusing on maximizing individual value and potential, pushing each "core" to peak performance, preventing parasitic cancerization, and prioritizing the collective’s long-term, evolutionary interests over immediate gains—these distinguish Symbiotic Communitarianism (this "true collectivism") from old-fashioned collectivism.  

A far-sighted collectivism must consider not merely the benefits of a single generation but the enduring interests of successive generations. This is where the dangers of egalitarianism—especially genetic egalitarianism across generations—become strikingly apparent.  

### The Origin of Inequality: Hierarchical Local Intensification and the Core-Periphery Structure  

Why does pursuing equal resource distribution often yield lesser collective benefits than relatively centralized allocation? For large, complex systems, after sufficient division of labor and cooperation, energy, matter, and resources tend to form a **phenomenon of hierarchical local intensification**, also known as the **core-periphery structure**. This structure, which maximizes overall efficiency, has been preserved and refined by Group Selection.  

This phenomenon is familiar: in a nation, though there are many cities, resources and talent flow first to a few core regions—think of first-tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, along with their surrounding areas. Centralized resource allocation here represents a compromise toward maximizing overall efficiency. Within regions, distribution remains uneven: in Guangdong, resources radiate outward from Guangzhou and Shenzhen, encompassing Foshan, Dongguan, Zhuhai, and then Zhongshan and Jiangmen, forming the Guangdong core—the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Beyond this, cities in northern, western, and eastern Guangdong remain underdeveloped, even within China’s most economically robust province.  

Within cities, the pattern persists. Take Guangzhou: resources are not evenly distributed, adhering instead to local intensification. The most concentrated area is Zhujiang New Town, followed by the Financial City, Pazhou Commercial District, Yuzhu Business Zone, and Baietan, with outer areas like Wanbo, Science City, Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, and Nansha Sub-Center. Other major cities similarly feature one or more core areas. At every level—urban agglomerations, core cities, and core business districts—central regions siphon population, commerce, education, and medical resources, forming an intensified structure. Nowhere is distribution average or dispersed.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/012595a6-a4f4-43aa-8061-d6fb42c1d2a6" />
</p>  

Consider a familiar microcosm: the most intricate human-made object, the computer. A personal computer comprises power supplies, motherboards, hard drives, and memory, but its core computational tasks are executed by the CPU—with other components serving as extensions and auxiliaries, coordinating via buses to support the CPU efficiently.  

Within the CPU, the basic operational units are transistors (a modern CPU may contain over 10 billion). The most critical part is the computational core (Core), but the CPU also includes auxiliary regions: shared Level 3 caches between cores, Ring Interconnects, Memory Controllers, and communication chips. All other components serve the Core, aiming to prepare input data as quickly as possible, output computational results, and store them efficiently. Thus, computers exhibit local intensification: even memory, hard drives, and motherboards contain intensified regions. Despite their size, a computer’s energy and resources concentrate in these highly intensified areas—spatial compression drives temporal compression, boosting efficiency, reducing costs, and lowering power consumption. While the number of transistors determines a CPU’s computational potential, scaling up single cores is rarely effective; instead, improving manufacturing processes (reducing transistor size) remains the viable path to enhancing computational power.  

The speed of light—the fastest known velocity—also imposes limits on information transmission. This introduces a cost that life cannot ignore: **spatiotemporal cost**. In a sense, life "designs" itself around this cost; otherwise, evolution might proceed from large to small, not small to large. The constraints of speed dictate that greater intensification reduces spatiotemporal costs and amplifies local cooperative dividends. Yet, cores cannot concentrate infinitely; thus, cooperation forms multi-centric, complex systems where transportation hubs siphon auxiliary resources, mirroring symbiotic forms. A CPU—or the entire computer—resembles a city with high-speed networks, a three-dimensional, core-intensive urban landscape where data acts as "human resources commuting to work."

Through Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity, we often uncover isomorphic phenomena across dimensions. The fundamental drivers behind these phenomena are the objective physical laws that govern the world at every moment—this is the essence of the "Dao."

The human brain operates in a similar manner. For the brain to achieve maximum energy efficiency, it must first develop toward intensification. [This means that survival competition drives the "process upgrade" of the human brain, which serves as the prerequisite for the entire human race to engage in efficient cooperation and technological innovation.] Owing to genetic mutations, among thousands of individuals, there will always emerge some with more advanced brains—brains better suited to serving as centers of intensification, generating new ideas or creating new systems. Hayek touched on this when extolling individualism. As AI tools grow increasingly powerful in the future, the gap between "super-individuals" and ordinary people may widen. Therefore, focusing on individual capabilities, providing all possible conditions to maximize the potential of exceptional individuals, and appropriately increasing their genetic benefits inherently serve the long-term interests of the entire symbiotic community—a strategy nearly all mature symbiotic systems adopt. For instance, many great pioneers of the Communist Party embodied this awareness. During the Liberation War, Marshal He Long, upon capturing a fine horse, intended to present it to Chairman Mao. Since Chairman Mao rarely participated in frontline battles, some advised Marshal He to keep the horse for himself. Marshal He replied: "Chairman Mao is our head; we are merely arms. If we lose an arm but save the head, life endures. If we lose the head, what use are the arms? Only with Chairman Mao's safety can we secure victory." [Is this elitism? Yes, but it is also an astute form of collectivism. Conversely, forcibly equalizing resources in the name of partial, so-called fairness or equality—thereby stripping the system of intensification and enforcing "eating from the same big pot"—ultimately harms the system's energy efficiency, acting against collective interests.]  

The law of resource intensification manifests repeatedly in the evolutionary process of life, often achieved through primitive accumulation via grabbing methods. For example, humans initially completed resource intensification through grabbing. Though this involves deficits from grabbing, the dividends generated by resource intensification offset these losses. Of course, [the ideal scenario is for different individuals to complete resource intensification through rational cooperation, rather than passive or forced intensification. The former entails partnerships; the latter, servitude.]  

## Parallel Computing—Breaking the Bottleneck of Excessive Intensification  
If intensification is so crucial, why not concentrate all resources into a single individual? Would this not maximize intensification, rendering cooperation and dimension ascension unnecessary, with a single "superhuman" accomplishing all tasks? To answer, we must look to the evolutionary history of all things. Why do we not consolidate all computing resources into a single chip, endlessly expanding its size? Because as a single chip grows larger, its cost-effectiveness diminishes significantly. This is a challenge all manufacturers have considered and attempted to solve, but objective laws impose limits, driving the development of multi-core, multi-core grouped (GPU), grid-based, and distributed multi-level hierarchical architectures. NVIDIA essentially bet on this trend: that single-core processor performance had reached its bottleneck, and future progress would depend on multi-core cooperative performance. Multi-core cooperation is not merely the aggregation of single cores; it requires solving issues of inter-core communication and collaboration, energy consumption and heat dissipation, and multi-core programming and parallel algorithms. This, too, constitutes a dimension ascension process, simplified only by the absence of genetic mutation and grabbing degeneration.

<div align="center">Typical multi-level hierarchical distributed architecture</div>  

The evolutionary laws of the narrow biological world mirror this exactly. Once individual optimization and expansion reach a certain threshold, dimension ascension through inter-individual cooperation becomes necessary. Single-celled organisms, such as *xenophyophores* (giant amoebas) with cells exceeding 10 cm, attempted to maximize size. Among multi-celled organisms, species like dinosaurs also strived for size. Yet all are constrained by the physical limits of cooperation within their dimension; further expansion within the same dimension leads to sharply reduced cost-effectiveness—akin to the impossibility of infinitely enlarging a single-core CPU. [Thus, life must ascend through hierarchical dimension elevation, continuously cooperating to expand the scale of cooperation, achieve scaling laws, and generate greater cooperative dividends.]

</div>  

In the macro world, we cannot invest all resources in a single city. Beyond a certain concentration threshold, efficiency gains plateau, and excessive centralization begins to harm long-term collective benefits. This stems from the relationship between the central hub and its supporting modules, constrained by spatial-temporal costs. Higher concentration demands highly efficient energy supply, heat dissipation, data transmission, and storage architectures for CPUs; for cities, it requires efficient transportation, dining services, and living environments. These supporting modules often become system bottlenecks, sometimes more critical and challenging than the core itself. Symbiotic Communitarianism reveals a truth: resource allocation may be regionally or even individually concentrated, but every individual within the cooperative system is vital—whether the central computing unit or auxiliary units. Those with greater resources compete to convert benefits for the collective most efficiently; those with fewer resources compete to provide maximum auxiliary value with minimal resources. [Their relationship is not one of strength versus weakness, but mutual dependence, complementarity, and symbiosis.]  

[Excessive equality and excessive concentration are both inefficient. Only an architecture with multiple intensifying components at each hierarchical level, alongside numerous hierarchical layers, constitutes the successful design blueprint for life. This blueprint applies not only to narrow carbon-based life but also to all artificial life forms, including computers. This is why excessively egalitarian utopian systems and overly centralized capitalist systems inherently tend toward failure.]  

[Inequality does not equate to unfairness. Reasonable, well-calibrated resource concentration achieves optimal overall efficiency. If the pursuit of equality overrides maximizing collective benefits and cooperative dividends, a servile society may even prove more efficient than an absolutely equal one, leading to the latter’s elimination. In that case, we would have chosen servitude ourselves—an excess as harmful as its opposite, with no one to blame but ourselves.]  

[Thus, only by reunderstanding the principles of collective benefits can we construct a society that is both universally happy and globally efficient, integrating the strengths of elitism and collectivism. This is a genuine form of collectivism that maximizes the long-term interests of the symbiotic community.]  

## The Exquisite Fusion of Individualism and Collectivism  
This was analyzed in essence in the previous volume, "The Ant Cult vs. Human Philosophy": "[Humans enjoy both the evolutionary speed brought by individual competition and the enormous fitness advantages of mutually beneficial group cooperation.] From this perspective, it is no exaggeration to say humanity is the most divinely favored species—this evolutionary mechanism has been realized in humans alone."  

[Dimension ascension is an economic issue concerning maximizing global computational power.] Drawing again on the computer analogy, its development trajectory progresses from single-core to multi-core. Single-core factors such as cache hit rate, bandwidth, branch prediction, and manufacturing processes must first be optimized to the extreme before multi-core, multi-thread, and distributed systems can deliver greater value. Disregarding individuals or neglecting their capabilities is akin to weak single-core performance or outdated manufacturing processes—ineffective. Science emerges from large-scale human cooperation, but scientists are products of individual intellectual capacity maximized through societal investment, support, and institutional bias. Concentrating resources on single cores—on the strongest brains—is often superior to distributing them among mediocre ones. This mirrors the logic of computer processor development: first optimize single-core performance to the extreme, upgrading manufacturing processes to maximize individual computational density, as single-core space is most concentrated, enabling the fastest data exchange via cache. For tasks that cannot be parallelized, 10 or even 100 cores are less effective than a single powerful core. The same applies to GPU single-card performance: for tasks ill-suited to multi-card parallelization, 100 average cards may yield less efficiency than one powerful card, due to slow inter-card data transmission (spatial-temporal costs at play). Similarly, allocating memory to one card can, in extreme cases, process tasks 10 to 100 times faster than distributing it across two. The exceptional capabilities of individuals, like the edge of a blade, rely on vast collective support, yet the critical turning points often stem from great individuals.

Individualism, in essence, is the collectivism of the previous dimension. As this book has repeatedly emphasized, an individual's strength stems from the continuous rise in cooperation among cells within multicellular life since the Cambrian period. Over time, these cells have become so integrated that they are indistinguishable from one another, forming a cohesive whole and even giving rise to self-awareness—a singular consciousness of "I." The strength of each individual, rooted in the high-degree cooperation within their internal systems, inevitably contributes to the strength of the next-dimensional collective.  

Before Moore's Law for CPU单核 performance was exhausted, even in cluster computing, improving the performance of each single core remained highly cost-effective. However, once Moore's Law is depleted, clinging to single-core performance will subject it to a dimensionality reduction attack by GPUs. The trajectory of Moore's Law for single-core performance is inherently less sustainable than that of multi-core development. Adhering to individual value at the expense of timely dimensional ascension after reaching the bottleneck of low-dimensional cooperation is akin to CPU manufacturers clinging to single-core performance and advocating individual value—an approach that will inevitably be superseded by GPU manufacturers. Similarly, cooperation among human individuals will ultimately surpass the highly advanced cell-level cooperation seen in large mammals and reptiles.  

Enhancing individual capabilities is a critical pathway to improving overall capacity, yet it has inherent limits. At this juncture, parallel cooperative capabilities become necessary. The advantage of GPUs over CPUs exemplifies how group cooperative capabilities deliver a dimensionality reduction attack on single-unit capabilities. However, this requires more advanced algorithms, software, and hardware architectures suited to "cooperation" to address complex synchronization issues. Otherwise, parallel capabilities remain underutilized, leading to inefficiency, high power consumption, and intractable heat dissipation problems. Here, the algorithms and software suited to parallel processing correspond to social mechanisms, while the hardware architectures optimized for cooperative parallelism equate to "moral instincts." Unlocking the dividends of parallel cooperation hinges on innovations in parallel architectures and algorithms—much as large-scale community cooperation relies on innovations in social institutions, such as law and market economies.  

This process of dimensional ascension is marked by setbacks, regressions, and moments of confusion, yet its trend is inexorable. Harmonious families, ethnic integration, and international collaboration, akin to multi-core computing, cluster computing, and cloud computing, represent the inevitable trajectory of cooperative dimensional ascension and efficiency enhancement. Symbiotic Communitarianism unifies collectivism, elitism, and individualism, redefining the goal of maximizing the long-term interests of the collective through the lens of evolutionary trends. Every component of the whole is vital, though their priorities and resource allocations differ, all converging toward the ultimate aim of maximizing the long-term interests of the entire system.  

### Excess and Deficiency: Both Are Malignant Tumors  
Distorted collectivism easily degenerates into a tool for PUA and exploitation, where virtuous individuals are denied just rewards. In response, we "awake" and arm ourselves with individualism to resist. In this era of rampant individualism, people now think only from their myopic self-interests, excessively validating values that serve their own positions while neglecting the fairness of others and the collective good. Those holding differing positions "argue vehemently" over their perceived truths, even fostering mutual resentment. What they fail to realize is that all forms of partiality toward one's own position—ultimately harming the interests of others—will almost certainly boomerang. Such actions damage the collective interests of the cooperative group, undermine the symbiotic life form itself, and compel others to adopt more covert and destructive means to defend their own interests, leading to a cycle of greater injustice countering injustice, and more irrationality balancing existing irrationality.  

In such circumstances, their resort to self-serving acts is a necessity, in a sense, to salvage the symbiotic life form. Otherwise, if they are eliminated by injustice, the symbiotic life form would be left with nothing but extreme, unbridled grabbingists. Thus, the first instigator of large-scale injustice, sparking a chain reaction of inequity, bears "tremendous responsibility" for the collapse of civilization. My pessimism and powerlessness toward modern humanity stem from this very phenomenon—the blindness imposed by human emotions and positional biases. Take gender antagonism: when conflict arises, women attack men, and men seek to blame women, yet neither reflects on their own role. Simplistic ideologies, such as the pursuit of excessive freedom as self-beneficial or absolute equality as a panacea, have profound deleterious effects.  

In reality, all human strife, fragmentation, internal friction, and mutual oppression arise from the overinflation of the self—placing one’s own interests above those of spouses, families, clans, nations, and humanity itself. We pursue our own freedom while disregarding the shackles of others; we demand fairness and equality only when we ourselves suffer injustice, yet remain indifferent when others’ freedoms are trampled or they face inequity. At best, we empathize only with those similar to ourselves, often within the same social stratum. This is the root of most human tragedies and a testament to humanity’s regression from the realm of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism to the Tit-for-Tat mechanism.  

Humanity must integrate the essence of both individualism and collectivism to forge a better future. Without the theoretical framework of Adversarial Evolution, the specter of grabbingism will infiltrate every crevice: collectivism will be weaponized for moral coercion, advocating altruism while ignoring the need to combat evil; individualism will be used to justify grabbing behaviors, emphasizing freedom, equality, and human rights while evading responsibility, obligation, and contribution. These perversions, steeped in grabbingism, are malignant tumors growing from originally sound principles.  

A common misconception is that Western pursuit of individualism, rooted in self-interest, has led to unparalleled achievements and the most brilliant civilizations in history, while Eastern nations, emphasizing collectivism, decorum, harmony, and ideals of great unity, have declined into "sick men of East Asia." The truth is that Western nations are relatively "young," simpler, and "less capable." They possess fewer hypocritical and grabbingist tactics, and lack the servile flattery and covert scheming of older cultures. A simple test: place a Westerner in a dysfunctional Eastern collective, and they will struggle to survive—precisely because they are insufficiently individualistic, hypocritical, or adept at political maneuvering.  

Paradoxically, Western individualism mitigates two fatal tumors for the collective life form: moral coercion under pseudo-collectivism and small-group grabbingism. In reality, the Chinese people, statistically, are more self-interested than younger nations, with lower public moral standards—though they are more adept at masking their self-interest. Western nations, having undergone the dual influences of Christian ethics and market economies, have seen unprecedented improvements in their cooperation degrees. The Chinese, often labeled "a sheet of loose sand," are not being denigrated here; rather, this observation reflects the opposite conclusion.  

The Chinese nation is ancient, with cancerous cells pervading its "body." Westerners, being "younger" with fewer such "cancer cells," have thrived under more advanced mechanisms. Yet these mechanisms cannot fundamentally resolve the "Chinese problem," and Western nations will soon face the same challenges that have plagued China for two millennia—challenges they will be ill-prepared to address. What makes the Chinese nation truly remarkable is its survival despite such "cancerization." Its individuals excel in intelligence, resilience, and adaptability, ranking among the world’s top. Nurtured by Confucian values, there are many with high-dimensional consciousness. With careful discernment, China’s traditional spirit is the closest to that of high-dimensional life. For millennia, this tradition has resisted the degenerative forces of grabbingism and hypocrisyism. Like a gold ore of exceptional purity mixed with sand, the Chinese nation holds boundless potential to shine once more.  

### True Collectivism: Symbiotic Communitarianism  
In essence, the goal of true collectivism—Symbiotic Communitarianism—is to maximize the long-term computational capacity of the whole. Key here are three concepts: "whole," "long-term," and "maximizing computational capacity" (another articulation of the definition of Virtue).  

- *Whole*: The evaluation criterion is collective, not individual.  
- *Computational Capacity*: Every unit must operate at peak efficiency, with complex cooperation and division of labor among units—roles akin to central processors, registers, high-performance caches, memory units, coprocessors, and specialized high-performance processors. Each role in the symbiotic system has its distinct function and excels in its domain.  
- *Long-term*: The system eschews short-term gains, prioritizing the maximization of future, long-term computational capacity.  

Maximizing long-term computational capacity requires the emergent capabilities of the whole, not endless optimization and internal competition within known systems that trap it in local optima. Thus, achieving this goal demands patience, acceptance of temporary setbacks, and tolerance for trial and error. True collectivism opposes excessive competition and internal friction. Competition should serve to strengthen cooperation at the previous dimension and allocate resources to more cooperative components, never for grabbing. When competition is necessary, we must engage with a sense of mission; once the outcome is determined, we should cooperate intimately, with mutual respect and admiration.

On the other hand, genuine collectivism also opposes inefficient, parasitic, conjoined-twin-like cooperation. Efficient cooperation is by no means egalitarianism, nor is it the collective corruption resulting from the "big pot" system (where resources are distributed equally regardless of contribution). Harmony does not equate to whitewashing conflicts, nor does it mean "the louder the complaint, the more benefits received" or "the more tears shed, the more rice obtained." Whether seeking victory in competition through cheating, unjust means, or unsustainable methods; or taking advantage, jostling for positions, claiming lucrative roles, or free-riding in cooperation—all these are forms of grabbing behavior, contradicting the original intent of high-dimensional life forms. When one views different individuals as distinct components of the same living entity, one naturally adopts the mindset of Symbiotic Communitarianism.  

Symbiotic Communitarianism represents a more far-sighted form of collectivism, focusing on the long-term stakes each part of the collective contributes to the whole, rather than fixating narrowly on immediate interests. If we consider cells—two-dimensional life forms—as individuals, all cells in animals are remarkably adept at the "mentality" of Symbiotic Communitarianism. For instance, if you are a brain cell in the body and discover a promising cell, you should act in its interest, striving to elevate it to benefit the entire human body, which in turn benefits every cell. Suppose you find that motor neurons in the body have exceptional athletic potential. You would then prompt other cells in the body to invest significant time and energy to support these motor cells—developing muscle, formulating systematic plans to allocate bodily resources to enhance athletic ability—so as to maximize their strengths. Even if this means brain cells, prioritizing physical exercise over mental activity, might produce fewer offspring or experience diminished logical thinking, you would not feel anxious; instead, you would take pride in the body’s athletic achievements.  

Even under the symbiotic mindset, cells are not absolutely fair or equal. Resource allocation follows principles of need and importance, generally adhering to the maxim: "Those with greater ability take on more labor; those who labor more receive more; those who receive more bear greater responsibility."  

Moreover, combating cancer remains a critical challenge that all high-dimensional symbiotic life forms cannot afford to neglect at any dimension or generation of evolution. This means that simply being kind to everyone does not equate to benefiting the symbiotic entity as a whole. Within a symbiotic organism, not all cells coexist in affectionate harmony. For problematic, harmful, or deceptively disguised cells, the organism may initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death), deploy macrophages to engulf them, or even drive the body to drastic "self-injury" such as tumor removal to survive. This does not contradict collectivism, for these corrupted parts are no longer "self" but "other." This is a principle that all high-dimensional life forms must thoroughly grasp. Struggles against grabbing-degenerate individuals permeate every facet of life’s evolutionary journey—a key distinction between Symbiotic Communitarianism and old-fashioned collectivism.  

All human value judgments must adhere to genuine collectivism—i.e., high-dimensional Symbiotic Communitarianism—to approach true beauty, reasonableness, and justice. This avoids the pitfalls of prioritizing trivialities over essentials or overstepping the mark. Genuine collectivism abounds with dialectics and the Doctrine of the Mean; only a profound understanding of the principles of Adversarial Evolution can reveal its subtleties.  

### May Each Maple Leaf Display Distinct Hues to Adorn the Kaleidoscope of Life  

Earlier, we emphasized the principle of Local Intensification. Does this mean the core should siphon all resources from the periphery? The answer is unequivocally no. Next, we address the principle of **Diversity of Functional Division of Labor**.  

We have repeatedly noted that life at all dimensions evolves through stages: from individualism to loose cooperation, then to division of labor, and finally to tight integration. This pattern is evident in numerous organisms undergoing dimensional ascension. Early cooperation is often loose—for example, Ediacaran macroorganisms, where each "cell" performs similar functions, and none is interdependent. Later, Volvox and choanoflagellates began to exhibit minimal functional specialization, though they remained largely self-sufficient, more akin to groups huddling for warmth without significant sacrifice for one another. By the Cambrian Period, true multicellular organisms emerged with highly specialized divisions of labor. The pseudo-three-dimensional Ediacaran life forms were swiftly outcompeted by more committed, true three-dimensional life forms. Thus, the laws of Dimensional Ascension and cooperative division of labor have completely overturned the old evolutionary framework’s definitions of "strength" and "weakness."  

In the past, strength and weakness were viewed as unipolar, fixed, and quantifiable metrics—typically intelligence, physical strength, etc. However, the demands of cooperative division of labor have subverted this unipolar perspective. Judgments of strength and weakness now become multi-dimensional, diverse, and outcome-oriented, as the strongest capabilities and combinations cannot be pre-defined; they emerge. This is simple to understand: anyone who has played DOTA-like games knows that a team cannot have too many "cores." In the early stages, many players favor marksman heroes, each appearing to have late-game potential and a seeming guarantee of victory. Yet in reality, such teams often fail, as every "core" suffers from insufficient resources, while lineups with seemingly weaker but cooperatively specialized individuals dominate. For true high-dimensional life forms, division of labor and hierarchical differentiation are indispensable.  

Take the human body: we cannot function without any organ. Individuals missing critical organs face near-certain death. While the brain and heart occupy central ("C-position") roles, limbs, eyes, nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, liver, gallbladder, and bones are all vital, each demanding excellence. In emergencies, we prioritize protecting the heart and brain; we may resort to "chopping off an arm to save the body" or "scraping bone to heal a wound." Yet no part of the body is neglected, unimportant, or unworthy of care. Instead, "deep bonds between limbs" and "the teeth feel cold when the lips are gone" are the most instinctive reactions of a qualified high-dimensional organism.  

Through such cross-dimensional analogical analysis, we recognize that human society, though it has cores and resource allocation biases, must serve the collective good. There should be no so-called "superior individuals," especially those who squander resources without commensurate contributions—these are akin to cancerized cells. Furthermore, different roles in human society have no strict hierarchy of superiority. The success of core functions often aggregates the successes of numerous supporting functions. In some cases, supporting roles are rarer than core roles and may hold greater potential value for the high-dimensional organism.  

Thus, the core of a high-dimensional organism must constantly express gratitude to its supporting parts—those who silently sacrifice time, opportunity, and resources to amplify the core’s achievements. They are "uncrowned kings."  

Core parts, having earned more applause, recognition, and emotional value, and thus enjoying greater initiative and convenience to seek personal gain, must also be subject to stricter constraints and assume greater responsibilities. Otherwise, everyone would scramble to be "flowers" rather than "leaves"—a gulf between human society and truly ascended high-dimensional life forms.  

Conversely, supporting roles should, guided by the maximization of collective interests, provide as much assistance to the core as possible to fulfill their life’s mission. From childhood, we must uncover each person’s true potential; in adulthood, they should pursue work they excel in, where they can enter a state of flow and realize holistic value. Misaligned division of labor—for example, assigning a scientist to manual labor—may make them appear a free-rider or grabbing individual. Forcing a manual laborer to become a scientist, against their inclination, may also lead them to act like a free-rider or grabbing individual. Society, schools, and families bear the responsibility to help each person fully explore and realize their diverse potentials.  

Every unique individual possesses unique potential value, which cannot be judged by rigid criteria. **The greater the diversity of humanity, the higher the likelihood of achieving optimal cooperative combinations**.  

Consider eye cells: initially, they may have been mutated, "diseased" cells. We must maintain a tolerant, open, and inclusive attitude, putting them to use. Over time, their light-sensitive function may be discovered, evolving into a visual center. Only through such tolerance can three-dimensional life forms one day first glimpse the vast earth, sun, moon, and stars. Evolution requires patience for unsightly intermediate stages, and revolutionary innovation is often unpredictable, emerging from trial and error. This demands that high-dimensional life forms possess an instinct for universal benevolence.  

In an environment of hyper-competition fixated on short-term gains, cells that might one day become eyes, wings, or brains could perish prematurely, stifling emergence and ascension. The organism then becomes trapped in infinite内卷 (involution), unable to evolve or ascend dimensions.  

Moreover, biodiversity serves as multiple insurance policies for the longevity of high-dimensional life. While high-dimensional, highly dependent parts possess strong agency, they are less resilient to environmental shifts; in times of great change, lower-dimensional life forms are more likely to survive. Only by preserving sufficient biodiversity and upholding the Great Path of Virtue can lower-dimensional life rebuild higher dimensions even if high-dimensional parts perish entirely.

We advocate for chivalrous competition, yet we must also avoid single-criterion competition. Within a highly specialized high-dimensional life form, the functions of its constituent individuals are diverse—vibrant and varied. The competition model we aim to construct is one of *multi-dimensional and frequency-divided competition*. A scenario where all "horses" (metaphorically, individuals) are forced to cross a single narrow bridge in silence is deeply lamentable. We must not pit intellectual workers against manual laborers in intelligence comparisons, nor vice versa. Similarly, we should not compare damage output between support roles and carry roles in a team. Just as we cannot ask soft tissue cells to compete with bone cells in hardness, or bone cells to compete with muscle cells in explosive power, we must reject rigid, uniform standards.  

We must not define so-called "talent" through homogenous exams; we must not determine the superiority or inferiority of genes based on intellectual prowess; we must not measure human worth by the amount of wealth; and we must never judge individuals by appearance or power. *Every non-grabbing component of the symbiotic whole is critically important and brims with infinite potential. It is precisely this diversity of potential that gives rise to the emergence of holistic capabilities. The whole cannot rely solely on the solitary strength of a single component.* These are the fundamental reasons why past versions of eugenics failed to hold.  

I am particularly fond of the metaphor in *The Lord of the Rings*. Within the Fellowship of the Ring, a company of heroes, there is Gandalf the wise, Aragorn the heir of kings, Legolas the elven archer, Gimli the dwarf warrior, and Boromir, the valiant human captain of Gondor. The hobbits Frodo and Sam, who seem to lack any outstanding abilities, appear entirely unworthy of the monumental task of carrying and destroying the One Ring. Yet, it is they alone who can complete this perilous quest. This is a profound metaphor: even small individuals possess immeasurable value. Wisdom, strength, agility, defense, and glory pale in comparison to an uncorrupted heart. Sam’s inability to bear the Ring himself, yet his capacity to carry Frodo, further reflects the author’s deep understanding of the value of supportive roles.  

We must deeply examine the potential of every type of social division of labor through the lens of the division-of-labor model of high-dimensional life forms. There is no hierarchy or inferiority among these roles—each is either an indispensable component of the high-dimensional life form or a component with future potential. Every role must avoid grabbing, resist corruption, and continuously transcend itself through competition within its own domain. We should strive unceasingly in our respective roles, embodying the spirit of "striving with heaven brings boundless joy; striving with earth brings boundless joy; striving with others brings boundless joy."  

Win with integrity; lose with grace. Individual wins and losses matter little—all individual competitions serve the group’s victory. For the group, there are no failed individuals. Losers are not shameful or pitiable. The genes of more suitable individuals will carry forward the genes of life as a whole, leading them toward a future brimming with infinite possibilities.
