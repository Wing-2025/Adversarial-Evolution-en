# Learning to Think Like Genes: Quantitative Moral Science  

Past moral judgments were overly intuitive, subjective, fragmented, superficial, localized, simplistic, and dichotomous. The greatest challenge facing contemporary human society lies in the contradiction between low-dimensional moral outlooks and the rapidly expanding scale of human groups, as well as the increasingly complex adversarial relationships. Humans, caught in this situation, inevitably feel confused, trapped, and helpless. On the one hand, there is a desire to reconstruct moral order; on the other hand, the intuitive moral system is found to be riddled with flaws and even contradictions, making this process futile or counterproductive. The individualist trends under the market economy and its rules have alleviated, to some extent, the lag of intuitive morality behind the times. However, it has failed to fundamentally replace morality and has even brought greater risks. In the context of major changes in the Adversarial Evolution environment, expecting intuitive morality to guide human behavior is akin to carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword or climbing a tree to catch fish—futile efforts that may lead to losing sight of the greater good and prioritizing trivial matters over essentials. [(Injustice caused by localized moral dogmatism may trigger severe moral degradation in other localities to compensate for losses, resulting in dual harm. Essentially, it is the partial fallacies of intuitive morality that have eroded the authority of rational morality.)]  

## How Morality Is Quantified  

[(Fundamentally, it is not that morality has become ineffective, but that we need to advance with the times and construct a moral paradigm suited to the new era and new environment.)] The form of intuitive morality has lagged behind, but the core and spirit of morality remain unchanged. To put it plainly, we must first clarify: What is morality? Why should we be moral? Only then can we address how morality should be practiced and quantified in the current era. [(The essence of morality is to shape a culture and instinct that facilitate large-scale social cooperation and the ultimate goal of Dimension Ascension. This goal can also be viewed as achieving the long-term survival of the genes of the life community.)] Morality, in essence, is the projection of the long-term interests of high-dimensional life forms onto immediate instincts and culture. With a clear understanding of this essence, we gain a yardstick to quantify morality.  

First, almost all past tenable moral outlooks can be validated through this framework. Examples include "good and evil are recompensed," "reward the virtuous and punish the wicked," "honesty and trustworthiness," "modesty and prudence," "loyalty and responsibility," "gratitude and reciprocity," "shame and self-reflection," "respect for the elderly and care for the young," "no theft or robbery," "no deception," "aspiring to greatness," and "devotion to the nation." However, whether certain moral outlooks consistently align with this ultimate paradigm or may change with macro-environmental shifts remains debatable—for instance, the pursuit of absolute freedom, demands for absolute equality, absolute democracy, and private property. [(This serves as a "mirror to expose falsehoods," capable of measuring all Virtue and Evil and laying bare Hypocrisyism.)]  

Take, for example, the criticism of China's "acquaintance society" and "banquet table culture." Superficially, assisting others in emergencies and reciprocating kindness appear as virtuous acts, and mutual gift-giving and gratitude are moral paradigms recognized by all successful nations worldwide. However, from the perspective of the long-term interests of the high-dimensional life community, showing favoritism to acquaintances, granting favors to bribers, and practicing discrimination are acts of injustice. Though seemingly trivial, such injustice inflicts significant harm. It prevents optimal resource allocation, shifts evolutionary trends toward bribery rather than creativity and constructive capacity, indirectly supports Free-Riderism,亏待s creators, and imposes substantial losses on the long-term interests of high-dimensional life. This is particularly true when public power and public property are used to show favoritism and reciprocate bribers—at their core, these are acts of collusion between bribers and bribed to defraud public interests and wealth, rather than the superficial mutual gift-giving and gratitude. [(Kinship and friendship are moral values, but from a holistic perspective, the efficiency of the community is a more critical moral value. In most cases, the priority of overall efficiency surpasses personal sentiment. Clarifying this helps us extricate ourselves from extensive PUA behaviors.)]  

Another example is Individualism, which has dual aspects. At times, it manifests as self-respect and self-love of central individuals, benefiting the long-term interests of the collective and thus qualifying as Virtue. More often, however, Individualism triggers self-serving Grabbingism, which constitutes Evil. Consider also Egalitarianism: on the surface, universal harmony does not violate morality. This is due to the "experience deficit" in human genetic instincts regarding Hypocrisyism and Grabbingism degradation, allowing Egalitarian trends to often evade criticism from intuitive morality. Yet Egalitarianism is frequently the environment sought by Free-Riderism genes. Hypocrisyism genes advocate Egalitarianism among poor individuals, using it as moral coercion; when born into wealthy classes, they seek to exploit. This is not difficult: they need only be prone to gambling—winning makes them heartless exploiters, losing allows them to advocate Egalitarianism and demand moral individuals cover their losses. Thus, they secure a safety net through Egalitarianism and social charity when they lose, while reaping massive profits when they win—a gene strategy that always prevails. [(A profound understanding of the antithesis of life—Individual Cancerization—may completely overhaul your perception of life and human society. Only by recognizing this can one make judgments aligned with Quantitative Moral Science.)]  

In fact, overly arbitrary and dogmatic moral judgments are extremely dangerous, which is why many believe humanity no longer needs "morality." [(Dogmatic, intuitive moral judges are, in essence, perpetrating Evil—and often incubating great Evil. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions," where "good intentions" refer to such dogmatic, intuitive morality.)] For humanity to progress further, the refinement and quantifiability of moral judgments are of utmost importance. This is also the issue that Utilitarianism has sought to address historically. As analyzed in the earlier section on criteria for measuring Virtue and Evil, however, Utilitarianism lacks long-term considerations, which will not be elaborated here.  

## The Relativity of Morality  

Quantitative Moral Science can even infer that moral standards and requirements vary across societies with differing degrees of Virtue and Evil. This aligns with the actual conditions of human society. The average level of collective Virtue and moral standards determines the cost-benefit ratio of an individual making sacrifices for the collective or strangers. This is also a mathematical calculation. If the average moral instinct of the group is lower than that of Individual A, the expected return on any sacrifice Individual A makes for the group is negative. If Individual A's moral instinct exceeds that of most others, his sacrifice—unless it generates significant long-term value for the group—may result in losses to the group's long-term interests from A's diminished inheritance, which could far outweigh the immediate benefits of his sacrifice.  

From this, we derive a corollary: an individual's subjective assessment of the collective's moral instincts and degree of Virtue significantly influences their willingness to contribute to the collective. If a person believes most of the world is populated by "bad people," their genes will "hint" that self-preservation is paramount. If everyone in a collective thinks this way, the collective will enter a ["vicious cycle of inherent Evil expectations"]. Even such self-suggestive mindsets can be exploited by Hypocrisyism. [(One typical way Hypocrisyists self-suggest is to convince themselves the world has no good people, making it easier to harm others with a clear conscience. They claim there are no good people or great individuals—everyone is self-serving.)] Under this perception, everyone becomes wary, reluctant to help others, and the community's cooperation degree plummets, entering a vicious cycle.  

It is worth noting, however, that if we reverse this by using public opinion and propaganda to make everyone believe others are good, thereby stimulating altruism, would this lead to a "benevolent cycle of inherent Virtue expectations"? In most cases, no. This approach is similar to the earlier "advocacy of Virtue": it can短期内 activate the contribution of virtuous individuals, increase cooperative dividends, and achieve short-term collectivist goals—useful as an emergency measure during wars or disasters. However, it rarely fosters a benevolent cycle [(because it overdraws on the power of Virtue)].麻木的Grabbingists and Hypocrisyists, with their strong "shielding abilities," continue grabbing as usual, accepting help without contributing, becoming the greatest beneficiaries of this period. As the proportion of virtuous individuals diminishes relative to these groups, the collective's long-term interests are severely damaged.  

## Quantitative Moral Science from a Holistic Perspective  

Moral outlooks must avoid dichotomization and solidification at the individual level—commonly referred to as avoiding being too "binary." We must abandon moral dogmatism. Overly dogmatic moral outlooks are, in most cases, the initiators of great Evil. We must transition from moral dogmatism and moral intuitionism to moral rationalism, realizing holistic moral outlooks and Quantitative Moral Science.  

Humans are complex, and events involving many individuals are even more so—akin to a game of "Werewolf." This requires us not to label or dichotomize individuals. Instead, we must find relatively quantifiable methods within these complex elements. Through careful analysis and comprehensive judgment over a longer time frame, we can identify differences in degrees, thereby distinguishing between good and bad individuals.

For instance, consider the use of political stratagems. Emperor Wen of Han, the founder of the Wen-Jing Reign of Prosperity, also employed stratagems in curbing the rise of regional powers and consolidating central authority. There are two motives for upholding central authority: one is to safeguard personal interests, and the other is to maintain national stability and collective welfare. His motive clearly leaned toward the latter. Owing to this distinction, his stratagems were generally kept within appropriate bounds, differing from those of Liu Bang and Empress Lü. After eliminating fiefdoms, Liu Bang and Empress Lü replaced them with their own sons and relatives; by contrast, Emperor Wen, after weakening fiefdoms, typically retained their descendants but further subdivided the territories to disperse their power.  

[Presently, a critical flaw plagues human intuitive morality and even legal systems: they easily fall into the local observation trap, leading to a failure to see the forest for the trees. Imagine two forests: someone hears a "crack" and notices one tree falling in the first forest, while no trees have fallen in the second. They might arbitrarily conclude the second forest is healthier. Little do they know, the second forest is rife with deadwood, whereas the remaining trees in the first forest thrive. This illusion—preferring a single fallen tree to an entirely withered forest—often pervades legal and moral judgments.]()  

"The one who carries firewood for the masses should not be blamed for faltering steps, let alone left to freeze in the snow." This epitomizes a simple holistic moral perspective. When an individual undertakes a great good, they may err in minor matters. Those who fixate on trivial flaws to morally coerce, ignoring the greater good, are themselves incarnations of evil. Such evil stems either from an inability to prioritize or distinguish right from wrong, or from jealousy, resentment, or a desire to harm through proxy—evils that cannot be easily forgiven.  

Take many cases of courageous intervention: legal rulings often follow the approach of "whoever strikes first is in the wrong; whoever is more injured is in the right," aiming merely to pacify conflicts. This rigid application of legal clauses lacks holistic, comprehensive, objective, and fair consideration, compounded by some law enforcers' tendency to bully the kind and fear the ruthless.  

Furthermore, the holistic moral perspective serves as a powerful tool for the virtuous to protect themselves. Well-intentioned individuals who engage in self-reflection are often more vulnerable to moral coercion and PUA. They are most easily targeted—their "faults" exaggerated, leading to relentless suppression and belittlement. For example, Bao Li was subjected to severe PUA by Mou Linhan after being accused of the "fault" of not being a virgin. Another case: during my ex-wife’s divorce, she demanded excessive pre-marital property, arguing her time spent on the family—equated to life, which she claimed was priceless—entitled her to infinite compensation. Here, we must transcend binary, low-order moral frameworks. Instead of being bound by slogans like "priceless," we should quantify contributions. By objectively measuring who has given more and created greater value, we can approach the truth. Only through holistic moral evaluation and quantitative moral philosophy can we cut through the fog, avoid moral coercion in trivial details, distinguish right from wrong, identify grabbing individuals from contributors, and prevent deception by partial accounts. This enables law and morality to protect the virtuous rather than the opposite.  

Many rational, logical thinkers, influenced by culture and science, have advanced to higher-order moral frameworks. A hallmark is their rejection of absolute right/wrong or virtue/evil, instead attempting to quantify moral worth. They better control intuitive likes/dislikes and emotions, analyzing issues calmly. They are not devoid of moral or value sensibilities—these are simply deeper. [They respect and revere instinctive and intuitive moral sensibilities yet dare to critically examine and reconstruct them in ways that benefit social progress.]()  

As Kant said, "Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me." The depth of morality rivals the cosmos. [Human understanding of morality fundamentally reflects our grasp of infinite foresightedness.]() Morality determines law and institutions; law and institutions shape the instincts of the next generation; instincts, in turn, mold the moral perspectives of higher-dimensional life forms. Only through this cyclical process can a positive feedback loop emerge. Cultivating correct moral perspectives is a long journey.  

Thinking like genes, thinking through the lens of Adversarial Evolution, requires infinite foresightedness and anticipation—an ideal never fully attainable, yet a path we must traverse. This path demands a pragmatic, self-correcting mindset.  

### How to Quantify the Evil of Involution  

In recent years, involution has been widely condemned. Yet, an intriguing phenomenon persists: despite the universal recognition that "involution" is pejorative and undesirable, no robust theory has definitively refuted it. Even a simple retort—"Don’t you hate involution just because you can’t compete?"—leaves critics struggling to respond coherently. This book endorses competition, but isn’t involution just extreme competition? Doesn’t extreme competition drive extreme progress? Such reasoning falls into the trap of classical evolutionary thinking, whereas Adversarial Evolution theory effectively exposes involution’s evils by redefining virtue and vice: [Virtue and evil are judged by whether an action benefits the long-term interests of the life community and ensures the longevity of its genes.]() Applying this criterion to involution reveals its insidious evil. Below, three metaphors illustrate how involution undermines the life community’s long-term interests.  

#### Metaphor 1: The Involutionary Path Paved with Money  

Involution is akin to racing on a man-made reward pool and a narrow bridge of societal fabrication. These rewards are both reasonable and flawed: some, like exams, are limited by designers’ capabilities and assessment costs; others, like corporate performance evaluations, are marred by evaluators’ biases and incompetence. [Involution amounts to willfully ignoring the irrationality of these goals, disregarding the conflict between innovation, value creation, and rigid, entrenched cognition, and neglecting the severe damage to long-termism—all to maximize short-term rewards and rush to seize the next goal.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f12fb8c3-b1d7-445c-9314-5b3953b61710" /></p>  
<p align="center">The Involutionary Path Paved with Money</p>  

On this involutionary path—paved with societal goals and short-term gains (depicted by the red line), people race frantically yet miserably. Most see the true long-term direction but delude themselves into ignoring it. Only a few genuine pioneers walk directly toward the long-term goal (the green line). They need not scramble; collaborating, they expand humanity’s cognitive frontiers. Yet, only a tiny fraction of these pioneers receive significant rewards. Most gain little societal support or success—even if their path is correct, closest to the goal, and aligned with the original intent of rewards. Involutionists seize nearly all rewards, leaving pioneers to struggle for survival. Over time, pioneer genes are eradicated, replaced by calculating, short-term-focused egoists. Society becomes populated by involutionists chasing immediate gains, leading to collective mediocrity, unearned rewards, mismatched abilities and roles, and aimless busyness. This aimlessness forces the entire society to work harder, descending into a vicious cycle.  

#### Metaphor 2: The Doping Analogy  

Doping harms the body physically and mentally, causing personality changes, erratic behavior, toxicity, dependency, and withdrawal symptoms. For an athlete, winning a critical match via doping may seem worthwhile—they accept the cost, and from a freedom-of-choice perspective, this appears justifiable. Yet [this self-destructive pursuit of victory inflicts a classic grabbing deficit on the whole.]() The total pool of victories and prize money is fixed; victory goes to the most reckless doper, causing long-term harm to all contenders’ health. This also subverts sports’ core purpose: selecting excellent athletic genes and promoting public fitness. Thus, doping is ultimately detrimental to collective interests and must be banned. Involution mirrors doping: both squander the future and generate grabbing deficits.  

#### Metaphor 3: The Burning Snowball—Crushing Others by Sacrificing Oneself

Modern societal mechanisms have created numerous snowballing opportunities. That is to say, if one gains a slight edge in a competition, they may leverage this marginal advantage to secure scarce opportunities—such as admission to elite schools, access to quality educational resources, class leadership roles, award opportunities, employment positions, or promotions and salary increases. Since these scarce opportunities yield significant benefits, they exponentially amplify even a minor advantage, giving rise to the snowball effect. Imagine a snowball-rolling game where larger snowballs translate to greater wealth. However, this game harbors a Pandora’s box-like hidden rule: individuals can burn the snow from their own balls to accelerate the rolling process. The total snow on the field is finite. When one person discovers this rule and burns their own snow to roll faster, they may indeed accumulate the most wealth. Yet others soon follow suit, adopting this rule with self-satisfaction, believing they have uncovered a universal truth. Eventually, the total amount of burned snow reaches 90% of the field’s resources. Consequently, the people in this snow field are far poorer than those in fields where this "universal truth" remains undiscovered. In the most extreme scenario, everyone is forced into a race to burn their own snow, yet all end up with nothing.  

In nearly all competitive environments, involution—sacrificing long-term personal gains to seize larger shares of public scarce resources—represents a classic example of the *Law of Grabbing Deficit*, inevitably causing collective loss. This fundamentally contradicts the original intent of healthy competition, which should enhance overall long-term benefits. Competition, as morally endorsed by humanity, stands in opposition to involution, which is universally resented. Their effects are diametrically opposed.  

### Involution: Grabbing-Oriented Excessive Competition  

All paths to extreme short-term success almost inevitably inflict significant harm on long-term success. This can be considered a natural law. For instance, hyper-intensive exam-oriented education inevitably damages long-term intellectual development and accurate talent screening, violating the objective laws of human brain development. Early-stage intellectual assessment and selection deviate further from ultimate intellectual evaluation. In fact, if we assessed intelligence at 1–2 years old, humans would score lower than chimpanzees; if we did so just days after birth, chimpanzees would lag behind pigs, horses, and cattle. A defining feature of human brain development is *neoteny*, a process of gradual accumulation and delayed fruition. Creatures that appear "slow" initially often achieve greater intelligence, while those maturing prematurely rarely make significant breakthroughs later. Actions such as seizing advantages at a critical juncture, excluding competitors, or forcing premature development are quintessential grabbing behaviors. This book consistently emphasizes the importance of non-grabbing competition, whereas involution is precisely a covert form of grabbing competition.  

While the artful application of laws, tactics, and power (fa, shu, shi) can foster harmony and adaptability in human relationships, when pushed to extremes by many, moderation itself becomes a liability, and involution breeds malice. Disliking involution is not a result of being outcompeted; rather, deliberate involution stems from a failure to compete fairly, driving short-sighted grabbing behavior. A well-known saying in Silicon Valley—"fake it until you make it"—epitomizes competitive involution. Initially, feigning competence may yield dividends, even enabling social ascent through deception. Yet when such pretense becomes widespread and sophisticated, it descends into catastrophe. Historical lessons are abundant: the Enron scandal, the Theranos blood-test fraud, Jia Yueting’s empty promises, and the "magic" story of Zhangzidao Fisheries.  

In a society rife with involution, vast numbers engage in superficial, credential-driven work, squandering societal resources. They conform endlessly to evaluative systems, hoarding resources without creating commensurate value, while those capable of long-term value creation struggle for support. This constitutes a severe secondary loss inflicted by involution. Over the past 1–200 years of capitalism’s triumph, market economies reliant on competition have been excessively deified. Excessive competition now pervades exam-oriented education and career advancement, reducing human value to a game of "leveling up" or "immortal cultivation." High-dimensional values—cooperation, legacy, love—are suppressed as never before. This value orientation subtly misleads ordinary individuals with fragile mental frameworks, trapping them in addictive feedback loops of "leveling up."  

Even more alarming, the ultimate form of involution is the pursuit of statistically optimal success paths without moral boundaries, aptly termed "competing to the bottom." Involution is not a competition of ability but of moral thresholds—disregarding any ethical line not legally proscribed, treating laws and morals as irrelevant if statistically profitable. This culminates in a mutual-harm scenario: you sell gutter oil, I sell glue noodles; you sell leather milk, I sell cadmium rice; you bribe counselors, I flatter professors; you fawn over bosses, I sabotage colleagues; you spin empty promises, I manipulate with false kindness; you PUA subordinates, I retaliate with petty cruelties; you collude with officials, I dominate both legal and criminal spheres.  

In extreme involution, all choices are forced toward short-sightedness, driven by survival instincts. This breeds greed, snobbery, and profit-obsession, further intensifying involution. Such a society becomes paranoid and myopic, eroding diversity and stifling innovation. Contrary to common perceptions of China and the West, Chinese society is not one of insufficient competition but of excessive competition—concealed beneath superficial harmony. Chinese culture’s "excessive competition to avoid competition" contrasts with Western success, which stems not from competition itself but from cooperation, supported by a competitive anti-cancer system designed to sustain collaboration.  

Involution, at its core, is a self-destructive arms race that sacrifices development to seize excess benefits. The distinction between involution and healthy competition lies not in immediate actions, but in how one utilizes acquired honors, ranks, or resources—whether to uphold original intentions and create greater societal value, or to engage in further speculative pursuits of fame and profit.  

The *Adversarial Evolution* framework often aligns more closely with humanity’s genuine moral intuitions than simplistic judgments. Involution epitomizes humanity’s hypocrisy and covert grabbing behavior—so convoluted that traditional intuitive ethics and moral theories struggle to critique it effectively. Without this new theoretical tool, addressing such moral dilemmas remains intractable. Yet, if unresolved, involution could potentially devour the immense cooperative dividends and resultant happiness that underpin human civilization.
