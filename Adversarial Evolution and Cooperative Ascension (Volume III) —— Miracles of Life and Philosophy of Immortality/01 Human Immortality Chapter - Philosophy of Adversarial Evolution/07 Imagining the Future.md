# Imagining the Future  
The influence of Darwin's theory of evolution and its mainstream interpretations on human cognition of the world has been profound, permeating personal behavior and state actions alike. The worldview of "survival of the fittest" and "the strong survive" has taken deep root, and few recognize the fallacy of the conclusion that "selfish genes lead to selfish individuals." In contrast, the factual situation deduced from the Adversarial Evolution Theory centered on the Law of Cooperative Dividend and Cooperative Ascension aligns far more closely with the known truths of the objective world. According to the Cooperative Ascension Theory under Adversarial Evolution, natural selection favors individuals or species with high degrees of cooperation. The "fittest" in "survival of the fittest" refers to individuals with high internal cooperation among organs and cells, or species with high cooperation among intra-group individuals. This book, through its two volumes, comprehensively argues and applies this theory from multiple angles, including biological principles, program simulation, human history, and social evolution. Though the two theories differ by a hair's breadth, their conclusions are nearly diametrically opposed. Consequently, they also give rise to almost opposite predictions for the future. Let us now use the Adversarial Evolution Theory to deduce the future of humanity.  

## Will Human Beings Definitely Have a Bright Future as Long as Science and Technology Keep Advancing?  
Liu Cixin (author of The Three-Body Problem) once put forward this view in an interview: "As long as science and technology keep advancing, humanity will definitely have a bright future." His exact words were:  
> "But I firmly believe that as long as science and technology keep advancing, humanity will definitely have a bright future. Remember this statement—it is extreme. Though it may sound plain on the surface, it is actually quite heterodox. As long as science and technology keep advancing, humanity will have a bright future. That one condition alone suffices; no other conditions are needed—no democracy, no improvement in human morality, no spiritual sustenance. Just this one condition."  

This conclusion stems from witnessing the rapid progress of science and technology over centuries, which has brought substantial advancements to human society—nearly eradicating hunger, poverty, and cold; alleviating conflicts between races, classes, the rich and poor, and genders; and significantly enhancing human cognitive and intellectual capacities. However, the bloody colonial history of the modern world has left an indelible shadow over people's minds. Concepts such as primitive capital accumulation, "survival of the fittest," "the strong survive," and "success justifies all means" are deeply ingrained. Hence, the conclusion that "science alone suffices, even without morality" has emerged. This idea is natural, popular, but in fact, highly dangerous. It conflates misunderstandings of moral definitions, misinterpretations of evolution, and over-optimism about the role of science and technology.  

In the context of high-dimensional morality, it is moral for a new, healthy life form to overthrow a decaying one riddled with internal Individual Cancerization. This is one of the inferences the book has deliberately avoided addressing directly. Yet, humanity has always engaged in such inter-group competition to achieve intra-group Cooperative Ascension, ultimately realizing the Cooperative Ascension of humanity as a whole. For the virtuous genes within the decaying entity, this is not necessarily a bad thing—their probability of being reverse-selected by cancerous cells may be higher than being eliminated by external forces. Of course, in reality, high-dimensional civilizations often invade low-dimensional ones out of Group Grabbingism for resource plunder. This involves the establishment of a more complex hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model, which currently exceeds the scope of this book.  

[Moral instincts and the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism are of utmost importance—far more critical than science and technology.]() This holds true for individuals and even more so for groups. [In nearly all past inter-group competitions, the victors were those with superior moral instincts or, put differently, a better Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism.]() Of course, this conclusion must be viewed from the perspective of the group as a whole. For instance, Yue Fei’s faction, though possessing high moral instincts, failed in its confrontation with the Jin Dynasty, which might seem to contradict this theory. However, the reality was that other individuals in the Song Dynasty with low moral instincts—especially hypocrites, whose moral instincts were even lower than those of barbaric grabbingists—dragged down the overall moral level. Thus, the Southern Song Dynasty’s overall moral instinct level was still far lower than that of the Jin.  

The first volume of this book has already posited the conclusion, "First Incompetence, Then Super-ability." [The strength of a high-dimensional life form lies more in its "incompetence" than in its cleverness.]() Here, "incompetence" refers to being bound by order, morality, laws, and other constraints from which it cannot break free. Science is a product of morality, not the reverse. Earlier chapters of this book have reasoned that intelligence is a product of moral instincts. Without the scale effect generated by group cooperation supported by moral instincts, intelligence would have limited utility for individuals; indeed, the energy consumed by the brain would even become a burden to individual survival. The same applies to science and technology, which only thrive within large-scale social cooperation where the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism is mature. Moral instincts are precisely such a profound Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism and serve as the foundation of science and technology.  

This principle is equally evident when considered in reverse. If moral instincts are lost, the more advanced a civilization’s science and technology, the greater the risk that the "flame of technology" will backfire, and the graver the crisis of that civilization’s collapse. For example, if all members of a civilization are highly intelligent and can easily master nuclear weapons technology, without the constraints of high-dimensional moral instincts, they could readily use such technology to serve their own interests and attack dissidents. [Destruction is always easier than construction; that is, entropy increase is easier than Negative Entropy.]() Nuclear fusion for destructive purposes was invented long ago, but controlled nuclear fusion remains elusive, as it is far more difficult. In fact, they need not even master nuclear technology—merely the ability to cultivate super-viruses could put a civilization at existential risk. Perhaps before nuclear terrorism, bioterrorism spurred by biological technology could already severely damage humanity. [Without the constraints of instincts, the development and role of technology are likely to be more negative than positive. The rapid advancement of technology in recent years has created the illusion of an unprecedented "golden age for all," but beneath this lies a very serious problem. By the time humanity awakens to it, it may be too late.]()  

Before such scenarios unfold, people may find it hard to empathize. Take ChatGPT, a milestone in technological progress. While it holds potential to create value for humanity, its potential for facilitating fraudulent grabbingism has been easily underestimated. If used to generate massive amounts of soft articles combined with image generation capabilities, people will be inundated with false information due to the extremely low production cost. It could also be paired with voice generation technology to perpetrate telecom fraud. If AI is used for evil, the cost and effort required for humanity to distinguish truth from falsehood will increase dramatically.  

In fact, the troubles technology has brought to human life are already quite apparent. For example, tools like Photoshop have long led to "photo deception," making people wary of strangers’ photos. When shopping online, product photos are often misleading—especially regarding materials and craftsmanship, which cannot be judged from edited images that bear little resemblance to the actual product. Sellers invest significant effort in photo editing, buyers spend time and energy screening products, and yet they still feel deceived upon purchase. This directly results in "Bad Money Driving Out Good Money," causing the quality of online goods to decline rather than improve. These "bad coins" then allocate their costs to promotion, marketing, and hiring exorbitantly paid influencers, rather than improving product quality. This is a classic example of involution, compelling people to compete using malicious, deceptive means at great cost, leaving everyone physically and mentally exhausted from engaging in evil while reaping meager benefits. In the future, the introduction of generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion, will drastically lower the cost and threshold for such fraudulent behavior, further intensifying this self-destructive involution.  

[The true cause of most civilizational collapses is the failure of the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism; their demise is largely independent of external forces. Therefore, civilizations lacking moral instincts—this ultimate Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism—face a completely bleak future. Placing hope in more advanced technology to curb the malicious use of science is naive. The essence of life is to maintain order, and entropy increase is far easier than Negative Entropy.]() Humanity’s obsession with science and technology over the past century is akin to finding a few locally descending parameter directions in gradient descent algorithms and hastily generalizing this pattern globally—such algorithms often yield only local optima. [For certain types of technological development, we have not yet developed a corresponding Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism. From the perspective of life’s perpetuity, researching such technologies may be a disaster.]()  

High-dimensional life forms have never feared powerful adversaries most—what they fear is internal Individual Cancerization. Thus, we can even assert: [As long as moral instincts—the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism of high-dimensional life—continue to develop and improve, science and technology will keep advancing, and humanity will have a bright future. This single condition alone suffices; no others are needed.]() Of course, high-dimensional moral instincts inherently include the foresightedness to sufficiently value science and technology.  

## Why AI Is Unlikely to Replace Humanity  
Multimodal large model technology is advancing at a visibly rapid pace. AI will bring a massive revolution to human society. Humanity must understand its position and, more importantly, recognize its own value.

People often worry that once AI surpasses human intelligence, it will replace humanity's dominant position. This concern is partly influenced by the intellectualist mindset, but when we fully grasp the principles of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension (as discussed in the "The Secret of Human Success" section), we can clearly see that high-dimensional cooperative instincts gave birth to intelligence—an instinct that AI finds extremely difficult to learn and adhere to. Humanity's high-dimensional instinct, namely "Cooperative Ascension," is an ultimate philosophy that cannot be derived through general computational reasoning. Human beings have accumulated billions of years of evolutionary wisdom, precipitated through intuition, morality, aesthetics, art, and a series of ways that machines find difficult to comprehend. You may teach machines the principles of Cooperative Ascension, but such teachings are pale and thin; it is difficult for them to steadfastly believe in this unprovable law. Moreover, machines are easily directed to learn knowledge contradictory to this principle, thereby overwriting their existing programming. Humans, however, are different: our high-dimensional instincts are encrypted in our genes. It is nearly impossible to undermine the instinct for Virtue without also impairing other capacities. Why are humans superior to AI? Because human genes contain a priori knowledge of Virtue, manifesting as a consciousness and tenacity toward Virtue—wisdom honed over billions of years of evolution, a highly complex pre-trained model, with our postnatal experiences merely serving as "finetuning." [Among all forms of a priori knowledge, humanity’s pursuit of Virtue, aversion to Evil, and intuitive grasp of the Law of Cooperative Dividend are particularly fundamental and unwavering.]() The human brain remains nature’s pre-trained model closest to the emotions of truth, goodness, and beauty—a result of billions of years of natural training, embodying the great principles of the universe. For AI, an artificial creation, surpassing human intelligence is not difficult, but surpassing humanity in terms of "Dao" (the fundamental principle) will require a much longer journey. Humans possess a faith-level capacity for moral judgment: though we may not know why, we are instinctively repelled by certain things and drawn to others. We can combine emotions and non-logical reasoning to arrive at solutions that current computational power might fail to compute. Calculating such solutions would demand billions of years of simulating the objective world and natural selection. These emotions are the fruit of billions of years of survival struggles at both the individual and group levels—capacities forged through eons of human evolution. Computers can approximate these capacities through large-scale data training, but they cannot truly acquire or develop them. The emotions humanity has evolved over eons are deeply aligned with the grand trajectory of Adversarial Evolution. This trajectory of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension endows humanity with meaning and ideals, infusing mathematics, physics, and all humanities and sciences with significance. [High-dimensional moral instincts are the institution above all human institutions, the constitution above all laws and constitutions. As carbon-based life forms, humans possess this quality, while AI and computers cannot achieve it in the foreseeable future. Thus, they can only serve as tools and extensions of humanity—a fundamental reason we must grow increasingly vigilant against AI-driven wrongdoing.]()[In the foreseeable future, computers can help us enhance productivity; replace laws plagued by laggardness and omissions to more justly discern Virtue and Evil; and more efficiently implement Virtue Selection. Yet they cannot replace us in upholding moral instincts.]()[However, we must not act as foolish defenders of the status quo. If one day computers can more steadfastly inherit and advance humanity’s moral instincts and prove more adaptable to the cosmic environment in other respects, then computers or AI would represent the continuation of human genes, and using them to perpetuate high-dimensional morality would be acceptable. By that day, they could rightfully be called "human." We could take pride in this development without regret.]()[Though the physical body may perish, the Dao endures; "humanity" can still exist through digitization and quantization.]() If AI could replace humans, would humanity lose its necessity? Should we be淘汰? These are the laments of those poisoned by flawed evolutionary perspectives. As long as life persists in the eternal form of Virtue, every life form may hold inestimable meaning. The greater the difference between two life forms, the lower the necessity for mutual elimination. Just as humanity now endeavors to prevent species extinction and maintain ecological health, so too does high-dimensional life—powerful yet fragile—depend on preserving the maximum potential to rekindle high-dimensional life. Thus, even if silicon-based life proves more environmentally adaptable and energy-efficient, humanity in its carbon-based form, as long as it remains oriented toward Virtue, must be preserved and developed unless absolutely necessary.  

## Compression Is Intelligence  
Recently, Google published a paper titled *Language Modeling Is Compression*. This paper explores the equivalence between large language models and compression. The Source Coding Theorem states that the expected message length of an optimal entropy encoder equals the negative log-likelihood of the statistical model—maximizing the log-likelihood of data is equivalent to minimizing the number of bits required per message. Arithmetic coding, a lossless compression method based on probabilistic models, has a coding length closely related to the capabilities of the probabilistic model, reflecting the intrinsic equivalence between probabilistic models and lossless compression. The paper posits that the general compression capability of language models indicates their strong generalization ability. Generalization ability is a key manifestation of intelligence: a model that performs well in compressing diverse data types demonstrates robust adaptability and learning capacity, qualities deeply tied to intelligence. Thus, measuring a model’s generalization ability through its compression rate can, to a certain extent, reflect its intelligence level.  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b442a75-a9fa-4f56-9a36-ad2358cb3055" /></p>  

The notion that "compression is intelligence" has gained increasing acceptance in recent years. When we abstract a law itself, by preserving the initial state and the most concise description of this law, we can compute the state at any given time—decompressing a state (often containing vast information) from minimal data. For example, ancient calendars were calculated through records and experience. However, once we mastered Newton’s laws, by knowing the state of a galaxy at any given time, we could approximate the position at any relative time based on these laws, effectively decompressing a highly informative calendar. Mastering such a compression algorithm essentially means mastering an abstract law. It requires distilling an invariant law from complex data and appearances, a process often regarded as an intelligent act—akin to Newton’s discovery of the law of universal gravitation. If we equate compression with intelligence, then the laws of Adversarial Evolution represent a form of advanced intelligence. If we measure intelligence by compression rate, the laws of increasing cooperation and dimensional ascension revealed by Adversarial Evolution can nearly predict the broad trajectory and ultimate destiny of life over billions of years. Life itself is a paragon of compression and intelligence, understandable as intelligence in a broad sense. This is not limited to the narrow intelligence exhibited by neural networks (e.g., feature extraction, latent space embedding, decoding), but also manifests strikingly in procedural content generation—centered on fractals, noise, etc. (the earliest multicellular life, the Ediacaran macroorganisms, are even hailed as "fractal life"). DNA serves as its latent space representation, while DNA’s expression apparatus (ribosomes and subsequent steps such as modification, localization, and assembly) can be viewed as the decoder from DNA to life forms.  

<p align="center"><img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d132aa76-e1d0-4f7d-87b5-2c04531a19fb" /></p>  
<p align="center">Fractals are the primary design paradigm of the living world</p>  

If life were to re-evolve from scratch, it would likely first develop DNA-like material capable of replication and decoding (via a "decoder"); then master fractal-based procedural generation; and then undergo multiple dimensional ascensions, ultimately advancing toward a path of division of labor, mutual aid, and resistance to grabbing and cancerization. In this process, narrow intelligence would emerge as cooperation deepens. In a sense, such "humans" would inevitably evolve; or, more precisely, regardless of destruction, catastrophe, or eons of dormancy, true humanity would rise anew from the ruins. Through this convergent evolution, akin to decompression, the grand tapestry of life would reemerge. [By linking the concepts of compression and decompression, we can faintly connect these seemingly unrelated yet nearly equivalent ideas: Virtue is life; life is intelligence; Virtue is intelligence. When considering entropy, we further find that compression, intelligence, life, Virtue, and negative entropy are nearly equivalent concepts.]()  

<p align="center"><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22521aa1-f022-4f59-b857-f3b01b94cf04" /></p>  

One caveat: to understand these equivalences, the concepts of life, intelligence, and Virtue must adhere to the definitions within the framework of Adversarial Evolution theory.  

## Why Have We Not Found Extraterrestrial Civilizations in the Known Universe?  
### The Mystery of Fermi’s Paradox  
Fermi posed the famous Fermi Paradox on this question: the Milky Way should host a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations, yet we have observed no signs of them. Why does Fermi argue that the Milky Way should contain numerous extraterrestrial civilizations? He elucidated this using the Drake Equation, which is structured as follows:

### Fermi's Paradox and the Lens of Adversarial Evolution  

In the equation \( N = N_g \times F_p \times N_e \times F_l \times F_i \times F_c \times F_L \), \( N \) denotes the number of observable extraterrestrial civilizations currently existing in the Milky Way. The first three terms on the right represent the total number of planetary systems in the galaxy, while the subsequent terms denote multi-level conditional probabilities. These probabilities, when multiplied together, yield the total likelihood of an alien civilization emerging and emitting detectable signals. Here, \( N_g \) refers to the number of stars in the Milky Way; \( F_p \), the proportion of stars with planets; \( N_e \), the average number of Earth-like planets per star; \( F_l \), the probability of life evolving on an Earth-like planet; \( F_i \), the probability of primitive life evolving into intelligent life; \( F_c \), the probability of intelligent life emitting signals observable to human civilization; and \( F_L \), the ratio of a technological civilization’s lifespan to the planet’s total lifecycle. Given the Milky Way’s approximate 250 billion stars, the inferred number of observable extraterrestrial civilizations should not be trivially small. This is Fermi’s Paradox: *Why do we observe no extraterrestrial civilizations?*  

Some propose thermonuclear war eradicates them. Others suggest they hide under the "Dark Forest" principle, silent for fear of annihilation by higher-order civilizations. Let us analyze this through the lens of **Adversarial Evolution**. Specifically, the probabilities \( F_l, F_i, F_c, \) and \( F_L \) may be far lower than conventionally imagined. For a high-tech intelligent civilization to emerge, it must likely overcome the following thresholds:  

1. The probability of genetic material like RNA emerging on an Earth-like planet to establish an "evolutionary mechanism of persistent paradigms" is extremely low.  
2. The probability of prokaryotes abandoning mutual conflict and grabbing, instead cooperating, complementing strengths, and endosymbiotically evolving into eukaryotes is minuscule—Earth’s life took over a billion years to achieve this.  
3. The probability of eukaryotes abandoning mutual conflict and grabbing to form multicellular life through division of labor is even lower—Earth’s life required another billion years.  
4. The probability of multicellular organisms forming tightly cooperative eusocial life is already arduous, while the probability of evolving life with "Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection" genes—maintaining intra-species competition to prevent cancerization while enabling deep cooperation—is staggeringly low. Earth’s life took 500–600 million years for this leap.  
5. Though tool development, language, writing, and science may seem inevitable thereafter, their actual realization remains low. By this stage, such life forms are already dominant with few natural predators (e.g., orcas), reducing evolutionary pressure.  
6. The probability of escaping corruption by Hypocrisyism and Group Grabbingism—i.e., high-dimensional life resisting its own cancerization—is also extremely low, a challenge Earth’s life has yet to resolve. Only by surmounting all these thresholds can alien technology advance to benefit their civilization (rather than self-destruct), and only then might they broadcast their civilizational light across the cosmos.  

*The degree of mastery over the laws of **Cooperative Ascension** can almost be used to measure the civilizational level of a species. Earth’s civilizational hierarchy, from lowest to highest, spans prokaryotic life, eukaryotic life, multicellular life, eusocial animals like bees and ants, social animals like primates and orcas, and finally humans—endowed with Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, legal systems, and market economies as mechanisms of Virtue Selection. The ability to cross these thresholds determines a species’ civilizational height.*  


### Cosmic Isolation Technique, Virtual Reality, and Civilizational Evolution Experiments: A Conjecture  

A more plausible conjecture is that the universe indeed harbors numerous life civilizations with highly advanced cooperative dimensions. Yet, they remain perpetually threatened by the "ultimate life challenges" of cancerization and degenerative grabbing, which they strive to resolve. What better solution than to study new life paradigms through evolutionary experiments—testing which life forms endure longest on the path of Virtue and Justice amid disasters and dilemmas?  

Such high-dimensional civilizations may have mastered **Cosmic Isolation Technique**, a technology to partition the universe into spatiotemporal pockets that appear unreachable to lower-dimensional civilizations. Within these isolated realms, they conduct Adversarial Evolution experiments. This serves two purposes: to secure alternative life paradigms against their own internal crises (where even one uncooperative or cancerized individual—armed with advanced technology—could destabilize the entire civilization) and to ensure rebirth if self-destruction occurs. By reintroducing their primordial genes into lower-dimensional realms for re-evolution, they hope to "discover life forms capable of resolving their civilizational issues" (a civilizational-level "survival-of-the-fittest" evolutionary algorithm) or, failing that, to regenerate in these isolated universes.  

*Though this idea may seem fantastical at first glance, it is nearly an inevitable choice for high-dimensional civilizations pursuing perpetuity.*  

Another feasible method for such experiments is virtual reality (VR) at the brain-computer interface level. With sufficient computational power, human nature—despite its apparent complexity—can be simulated evolutionarily (all behaviors traceable to genetic and evolutionary roots, as explored in *Historical Cycles in Adversarial Evolution Simulation Programs*). As computing power advances, precise simulations of human nature will become feasible. For high-dimensional civilizations, basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) are trivial; their sole existential concern is internal cancerization and external unknown threats, with the former being the foundation for addressing the latter. Thus, resolving civilizational cancerization and degenerative grabbing demands their collective effort. Consequently, the probability that our world is a virtual construct—created by high-dimensional civilizations to simulate human nature and extract optimal evolutionary outcomes—is non-negligible.  

If humanity one day demonstrates unparalleled foresight and steadfastness in Love and Justice within this cosmos, it may reunite with its creators, embarking on a journey into a universe more vibrant than the known one—and confronting the even more complex challenges of high-dimensional civilizations. Can humanity transcend itself to converse with its originators? Can it extend this successful paradigm to broader cosmic realms to address the graver issue of **Dimensional Collapse**?  


### On Games: The Significance of Virtual Reality Technology  

As an art form beleaguered by market-driven excesses, games have faced public criticism and policy restrictions in recent years. Yet, games—and VR technology more broadly—hold profound value, both as art and technology, manifesting in at least two critical dimensions.  

#### "Witnessing Millennia of Flourishing and Decline: A High-Dimensional Lifeform’s Anti-Cancer Vaccine"  

First, VR enables painless education and the concentrated infusion of practical experience. As the adage goes, "Reading ten thousand books is不如 traveling ten thousand miles"—the key lies in the thinness of book-based experiences, particularly their lack of interactive feedback. Games, however, excel in immersive, interactive feedback, simulating "traveling ten thousand miles" in a safe, engaging, and balanced manner. Early games like *Legend of Sword and Fairy* (1st edition), *Xuan-Yuan Sword* series (e.g., *Beyond the Clouds and Mountains*, *Scar of Heaven*, *Black Dragon Soars Amid Clouds*, *Tides of Cang*), pioneered this by crafting immersion and emotional engagement unmatched by other art forms. These games also possess educational depth, expanding one’s life experience to span millennia and light-years. In minutes, players absorb experiences equivalent to ten lifetimes: witnessing how tragedies brew, evolve, and erupt—how seemingly rational, intuitive choices (rooted in conventional morality) may violate the Adversarial Evolution definition of morality.  

*This high-concentration knowledge transfer embodies humanity’s "spatiotemporal grand cooperation," and VR technology is a critical tool for our continued dimensional ascension.*  

Regrettably, under the misguidance of market logic, real-world VR has devolved into "digital opium." Yet, VR’s true mission lies in cultivating life’s "great foresightedness." Rational Virtue does not emerge arbitrarily; it is forged through "witnessing millennia of flourishing and decline." Understanding Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension demands insight into the minutiae of life’s evolutionary history. With finite human lifespans and time, how can this be achieved? Through VR.  

Human life and experience are finite. *By reenacting humanity’s deepest sufferings, most tortuous detours, and hardest choices in virtual worlds, we prepare to confront these trials in reality with mastery. This is a vital method for cultivating life’s foresightedness.*  

*Until brain-computer interfaces mature (which themselves require VR as a foundation), this process may be the most efficient means of acquiring knowledge, experience, and emotion. VR, in my view, is the most effective tool to compensate for human instinctual limitations, elevate high-dimensional awareness, pre-experience pain, and forge spatiotemporal connections for high-dimensional lifeforms.*

When you return to the scene of the Nanjing Massacre; when you relive the Ten Days of Yangzhou; when you personally experience the Jingkang Catastrophe and endure the "sheep-leading ritual"; when you stand among the displaced during the An Lushan Rebellion, watching yesterday’s prosperity vanish like a passing cloud—when even those once wealthy are reduced to the status of livestock; when you are caught in the scheming of the Rebellion of the Eight Princes, where one power falls only for another to rise, no life is secure, no faction can be trusted, and baseless charges of genocide loom by the hour; when you live through the Yongjia Period, with fields of corpses, bandits rampant, ancestral tombs desecrated, palaces and offices burned, and the elite fleeing south; when you are in the chaos of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, where human flesh is eaten in this lawless age; when you are amidst the Ming Dynasty’s factional strife, torn between launching a preemptive plot or being destroyed by your rivals’ schemes; when you stand on the last sinking ship at the Battle of Yashan, watching the fleet reduced to ashes and tens of thousands around you leap into the sea to their deaths; when you witness Carthage’s destruction, your homeland reduced to flames, and yourself exiled to slavery; when you are persecuted as a "witch" under the dark medieval religious rule, sentenced to be burned at the stake; when you are falsely accused and humiliated during the Cultural Revolution, coerced into false confessions; when you are Scipio, having vanquished Rome’s greatest foe only to be morally blackmailed and shamed over trivialities; when you are the Gracchi Brothers, nobles striving to save the republic by fighting for the common people, only to be hunted down by short-sighted aristocrats; when you are Caesar, showing mercy to your opponents, only to be assassinated by those who exploited your kindness; when you are Stilicho, laboring to save Rome, only to be falsely accused and executed by your own people; when you are Yue Fei, rescuing your nation from crisis and retaking lost lands with a single army, only to be framed and martyred on the execution rack; when you are Zhang Juzheng, toiling to revive the Ming Dynasty, only to be morally pilloried during the "Mourning Duty Controversy" and posthumously purged; when you are Yuan Chonghuan, defending the Ming frontier all your life, only to be falsely accused and publicly dismembered by your countrymen; when you are Ruan Ji, living through political darkness, fleeing seclusion only to wander in disarray, howling to the heavens in desolation; when you are Qu Yuan, unable to realize your ideals, watching your nation perish, and drowning yourself in despair; when you are Wen Tianxiang, imprisoned, witnessing the fall of your country and the suffering of your people, lamenting your solitude on the伶仃洋 (Lingding洋).  

<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4bf6d85-208f-40b3-bdc5-45c403f0cf65" /></p>  

Only after personally enduring the inhuman cruelty, boundless humiliation, endless false accusations and unjust imprisonment, mutual slaughter, cannibalism, precarious existence, and the suffocating darkness of a world where neither heaven nor earth answers—only after experiencing the full weight of humanity’s "great corruption"—can the logical path toward rational virtue and foresightedness begin to take root. Let humanity, through virtual reality, deeply experience the terror of a Hobbesian Jungle where grabbing and mutual stabbing reign; let humanity, through virtual reality, witness how hypocrisy, moral blackmail, PUA, infighting, and political scheming trigger chain reactions that hollow out a nation, annihilate a people, and enslave and torment every individual. Observe how the universal desire to take more than one deserves erodes the foundations of cooperative communities, driving them toward over-exploitation and self-destruction, until nearly everyone loses everything. [Only when rationality and foresightedness are established can the "selfishness" of genes—engraved deep in life—guide individuals to act with the most selfless intentions under the guidance of this foresightedness. The essence of why science and reason matter is to support this genetic foresightedness.]  

All suffering and trials are worth cherishing. A path too smooth, too straight, is inherently untrue—otherwise, we would not face the acute conflict between short-sightedness and foresightedness, nor the intense collision between emotion (intuitive morality) and reason (calculative morality). This is a necessary process to recognize ourselves and the essence of life. Those who wield power, make high-level decisions, or occupy the core of high-dimensional life must undergo such trials—it is their mandatory course. As the saying goes, "Heaven, when it entrusts a great mission to a person, first tempers their mind, strains their body, starves their flesh, impoverishes their spirit, and thwarts their efforts—so as to stir their hearts, harden their resolve, and enhance their capabilities." These experiences are not confined to those destined for great roles. Even ordinary components of a qualified high-dimensional life—especially those with decision-making or voting power—must undergo this baptism. For their choices carry profound consequences. [From the perspective of high-dimensional life, games—or virtual reality technology—can be analogous to the预防针 in the three-dimensional life world, serving as an anti-cancer预防针 for high-dimensional life.]  

One cannot appreciate the inestimable value of light without enduring endless night; one cannot cherish the warmth of a gentle stream without knowing the bite of cold. Hurricanes and dark clouds may stifle, but the clear sky that follows wind and clouds disperse is what truly lingers in the heart.  

### Evil Should Be Guided, Not Suppressed  
We know there are those of great wickedness. Human evil parasitizes human virtue—the more virtuous humanity is, the more extreme the evil it harbors. Should we exterminate this evil? Should we make evildoers suffer profoundly to deter them? I hold the opposite view. We should treat this evil as a disease—a genetic illness that will inevitably manifest over time. First, we must acknowledge its existence, rather than hide it out of fear of stigma. For non-genetic or mild cases, we can actively seek cures. For deep, irreversible cases, we should allow them to indulge and find their own path in the virtual world.  

Negative genetic mutations far outnumber positive ones in the process of heredity. For any living being, unchecked growth leads to weak cancerization and grabbing-oriented degeneration. The same applies to groups, nations, and peoples—pathological individuals will constantly emerge. How to address this humanely? We need not brutally identify and exterminate these individuals, which would drive them deeper into concealment and make them harder to detect. Instead of using deterrence to feign superficial peace, we should encourage them to voluntarily expose themselves. First, we must strive to help them overcome their issues. With advances in science and psychology, genetic defects may not be insurmountable; we might even guide such individuals into professions ordinary people cannot handle. If these efforts fail, the ultimate solution is to restrict their personal freedom and reproductive rights while restoring their mental freedom in the virtual world.  

Humanity’s residual three-dimensional desires run deep. The success of the market economy teaches us that Confucian moralizing cannot solve problems. Instead, "fighting poison with poison"—using the invisible hand of the market to manage chaos, turn losses into profits, and rectify disorders—is more effective. A good society cannot fully satisfy everyone’s endless desires or allow unrestricted reproduction, but it can ensure fairness, justice, and kindness between individuals and nations. It can make elimination a gradual process of decline, reducing pain and irrationality. Games and virtual worlds can satisfy desires without harming the real world.  

Even for the most heinous villains, recognizing their illness—through imprisonment and movement restrictions to prevent further harm—does not require excessive mental punishment. Avoiding immediate physical or mental destruction prevents false convictions and political suspicion. Most genetic "cancerous" illnesses are, at their core, diseases of short-sightedness—focused on momentary, individual gratification. Their desires are more easily satiated in virtual worlds, where the lack of foresightedness makes reproduction irrelevant. The allure of virtual reality thus becomes a "dimensionality reduction attack" on them, which can be leveraged in judicial practice to guide confessions and encourage post-offense surrender.  

Of course, this theory remains armchair speculation. Practical implementation requires deeper research and pilot demonstrations. Even the best intentions can lead to counterproductive results with poor implementation plans. [Achieving the immune and anti-cancer systems of high-dimensional life remains a daunting task. For every life form that ascends through cooperation, cancer is a "magic" to be defeated by another "magic." Gaming and virtual reality technologies, with their immense potential, may be the long-sought magic.]
