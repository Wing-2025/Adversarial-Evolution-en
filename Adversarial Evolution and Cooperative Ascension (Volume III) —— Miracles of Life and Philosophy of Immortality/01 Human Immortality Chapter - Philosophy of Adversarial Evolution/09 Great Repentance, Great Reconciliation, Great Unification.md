# Great Repentance, Great Reconciliation, Great Unification  

Before humanity undergoes a fundamental transformation, it must still experience several profound and unforgettable events: Great Repentance, Great Reconciliation, and Great Unification. First, we must fully recognize our limitations, past mistakes, and the value of those who have failed; second, we must reconcile with ourselves, with the past, and with history; we must acknowledge the partial correctness and partial limitations of different ideological trends across various historical stages of humanity. From these, we can discover that diverse theories, ideologies, science, and religion can achieve a mathematical unity under the laws of higher-dimensional life.  

## Great Repentance  

Humanity must repent for itself, casting off self-serving positions and transcending self-centeredness. In a sense, we are all hypocrisyists, seeking to evade moral condemnation—living behind masks while intentionally or unintentionally using morality to bind others. Most of us are afflicted with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) or are latent NPD carriers, always prioritizing and centering ourselves. We often turn a blind eye to others’ legitimate demands that benefit the long-term interests of the group, yet we rationalize our own excessive or inopportune desires. We are to varying degrees servile, bullying the kind and fearing the cruel; we often commit evil or act as accomplices to it. We can say we all bear original sin—we have eliminated genes that are more excellent and beneficial to the life community, which is why those surviving today are us. We are the genes that "won the competition," but our victory is not honorable.  

When we strive for our own interests, we invoke the banners of freedom and equality; yet when we can encroach on others’ interests, we greedily take more than our share. Each of us, in "unfavorable environments" and "out of necessity," submits to evil, exploits goodness, and aids tyranny. We apply the tactics our superiors used on us to PUA our subordinates; we learn to frame competitors in the manner of those who hide daggers behind smiles; we learn to counter-PUA leaders through verbose exaggeration and fabrication. When mediating disputes, we avoid addressing the core issues by "punishing both sides equally" based on who is more accommodating, not on facts. When voting on right and wrong, we follow factions and positions rather than truth and justice. When we must dismiss subordinates, we decide based on who is easier to bully, not on performance. When considering job changes, we neglect to repay those who nurtured us, focusing only on higher salaries and greater authority. As we learn to conceal, deceive, flatter superiors, intimidate, and form cliques; as we master honeyed words with hidden malice, suppression, push-pull tactics, and muddling through—we do indeed live better, but we gradually become the people we once despised.  

As three-dimensional life forms, we seem to lose nothing: higher incomes, higher status, better lives. Why then do we come to despise ourselves? This disdain is not unfounded—it arises from the higher-dimensional self loathing the lower-dimensional self. Nearly all of us should feel ashamed of ourselves and repent for certain actions; this is what we owe to ourselves, to the self that truly represents the glory, mission, and dignity of life.  

Do we, as the surviving genes, carry original sin? Have we aided tyranny, turned a blind eye to the suffering and injustice inflicted on others? Have we, out of jealousy or numbness, harmed a kind person or allowed harm to befall them? Have we relentlessly pressed a reasonable person, wronged a good person for personal gain, yet yielded to bullies and power, cowered before villains and authority? Have we consciously or unconsciously participated in a critical link of a long chain of evil? Have we silently abided by evil unspoken rules, enjoying benefits while having the power to change them? Have we sought to bully the good but hesitated to confront the evil? Have we allowed those who "carry firewood for the masses" to freeze in the snow?  

[Any method of harming others that easily succeeds will, with high probability, be returned to us multiplied after multiple generations. All the malice we face today may stem from our own genes, which, in past generations, were overly short-sighted and ignorant, using such methods against others to gain genetic advantage, spreading these genes, and ultimately having them turned against us.]  

Thus, the suffering we and our descendants endure is our just retribution. Our confusion, loss, helplessness, struggles, and suffering all originate from the evil committed by our genes in the past. If the good receive no reward, the evil will only multiply. Therefore, all the malice we encounter in the present arises from the imbalance in how our genes have historically treated virtue and evil.  

Yet some spend their lives standing solely on their own positions, seeing only one side of the coin, and using their entire being to oppose—overcorrecting, going too far—and ultimately harming their own genes in another dimension. What a karmic cycle: picking up a stone to smash one’s own foot. As the surviving genes in an environment where "nobility is the epitaph of the noble, and baseness is the passport of the base," we necessarily carry more or less original sin. To reduce future retribution, we must act to atone for our genes’ original sin. Those who cannot repent, who are obstinate and cannot confront their own genes, may only be enslaved or eliminated.  

## Great Reconciliation  

Despite humanity’s many shortcomings and flaws, despite the fact that contemporary humans are not the ultimate form of life, despite the need for earth-shattering evolution, and despite the corruption and cancerization that taint human genes to some extent, human genes still contain partial characteristics of the ultimate life form—features that are crucial and precious. The spirit of universal love, sacrifice, loyalty and trust, sense of order, competitive spirit, advanced intelligence, and yearning for the abstract beauty of mathematics and the concrete beauty of nature that humanity displays are likely the traits closest to the ultimate life form in the living world.  

Though these nascent characteristics contradict those of three-dimensional life forms, and though humanity still retains many "bad habits" fostered by its long-standing three-dimensional form, this transformative process is nearly inevitable. Just as during the Cambrian explosion of life, the two-dimensional eukaryotes of the pre-Cambrian era—having undergone the macroevolution of the Ediacaran Period—were the life forms closest to three-dimensional existence at the time. Though they still needed to undergo Cambrian-like transformation, their mission was already destined to be fulfilled by them.  

First, we must reconcile with ourselves. No other animal engages in self-negation, reflects on its mistakes, feels shame for its actions, or experiences guilt for its crimes as humans do. This is precisely what makes humans human, what enabled this species to achieve great glory in a fleeting historical moment. As long as we retain this capacity for reflection, we still have hope; we can still return to glory.  

We must reconcile with the diverse social divisions of labor. We should try to gratitude those in different roles and "classes," starting by understanding their efforts and difficulties. May there come a day when, upon meeting anyone—even a stranger—we can sincerely and wholeheartedly say, "You’ve worked hard," filling every cell of the community with a sense of value, confidence, and belonging.  

We must even reconcile with evil, with the "cancer cells" of human society. These are flesh and blood grown from our own bodies—though cancerized and diseased, they remain connected to us, bound by unbroken ties. Even when excision is necessary, we must administer anesthesia and alleviate pain. We should not be relentless in our righteousness; we should strive to understand all once-brilliant cultures and ideas. We can almost always extract their essence, though nearly all such cultures and ideas have, in their transmission, spawned distortions and drawbacks. We should not entirely reject them because of these flaws.  

Sometimes, conflicts between values are actually contests between higher-dimensional thinking and another, potentially more far-sighted form of higher-dimensional thinking. Some analyze rationally and find issues; others sense problems instinctively. Some believe their reason has seen through things, but in reality, genetic instinct may see further. Sometimes instinct deems certain things immoral, but such instincts may be outdated or at least inopportune.  

[This requires mutual understanding. Before negating others’ views, we should first affirm their reasonableness; after passionately defending our own views, we should objectively analyze their drawbacks.]  

Those who are completely unforgiving, relentless in righteousness, and fixated on partial concepts are often harmful or have ulterior motives.  

[Audience members must not think that "boosting others’ morale" means "diminishing one’s own." Only when the audience’s quality improves can the quality of decision-makers improve.]  

[Life has no path but the perpetuation of genes. Along this path, there will be cruelty, bloodshed, treachery, and chaos—but trust me, these exist to highlight the importance of love, loyalty, trust, harmony, and beauty. That is the final movement of life’s cycles; beyond this, life has no other path.]  

Since prokaryotic life, humanity, at every critical evolutionary juncture, has resolutely chosen love over opposition and grabbing. It is this species that has ultimately overcome countless hardships and achieved prosperity and civilization.

Thinking of this, I have fully made peace with humanity and human nature. All the achievements humanity has attained are built from countless miracles. Though not perfect, though replete with countless regrets, as long as we cast off the cancerous parts, humanity remains the most representative, most promising, and most magnificent high-dimensional life phenomenon in the biological world.  

The Grand Unified Theory of Adversarial Evolution reveals the intrinsic unity of nearly all past insightful human theories. Whether it be the selfish gene theory or group selection; individualism, elitism, or collectivism; capitalism or socialism; pragmatism or idealism; nihilism or existentialism; even idealism and materialism. Whether from Richard Dawkins or Edward Wilson; Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche or Karl Marx; Han Fei or Confucius; Sakyamuni or Jesus—[their theories all manifest their rationality and ultimate unity within the framework of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension.]() The contradictions between their differing ideological systems arise because they often perceive only spatially or temporally localized patterns, or overcorrect to counter existing biases. This process resembles the parable of the blind men and the elephant or the fable of carving a mark on the boat to find the lost sword: they touch different parts of the same entity, or inscribe traces of the same entity at different times and states, thus producing divergent interpretations.  

For example, Dawkins observed the selfishness of genes that underlies the selfishness of three-dimensional life; Wilson, by contrast, saw the selfishness of the four-dimensional life as a whole. Both converge at the level of genetic selfishness. Nietzsche focused on the importance of cellular-level cooperation within three-dimensional life—individual capability, individualism, the "will to power" of three-dimensional life—while Marx emphasized the significance of cooperation among individuals within four-dimensional life. Hegel, in turn, perceived the "will to power" of the four-dimensional state. Han Fei and Machiavelli, living amid national crises and collapsing systems, prioritized the survival of high-dimensional life even if it required unscrupulous means; Confucius, witnessing moral decay, individual cancerization, and the spread of grabbingism, strove to halt and reverse this process. Sakyamuni discerned the principles of karmic cycles, mirrored reflections, and self-torment rooted in genetic sin; Jesus sought a path of self-redemption from this original genetic sin.  

From a materialist perspective, the world is void and meaningless; yet the selfishness of genes has shaped an idealist world, endowing the cold, objective material world with ultimate meaning. Ultimate selfishness begets ultimate foresightedness, and ultimate foresightedness gives rise to ultimate ideals and wisdom. This meaning has governed the development of life for billions of years and will continue to guide life toward an endless future—even if this meaning is only reflected in the idealist consciousness of life and may be worthless in the unfeeling objective material world. Paradoxically, it is precisely the inevitable outcome directed by the laws of the objective material world. This meaning will forever sustain life in transforming the cold, unyielding material world into a vibrant, graceful, tender, grand, and beautiful one.  

Many conclusions of Adversarial Evolution, at first glance, seem shocking, revolutionary, and even challenging to the survival instincts and intuitive morality humans have developed over eons. Yet upon deeper reflection, they align with humanity’s most fundamental pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty. Moreover, they reveal that subjective constructs like morality and meaning also possess a mathematical symmetry and unity. Once one engages with and endeavors to understand the high-dimensional life forms deduced by Adversarial Evolution, it becomes profoundly compelling—it reconstructs the complex world in a manner of profound self-consistency, order, negative entropy, and elegance. Its form embodies mathematical unity and religious ultimate concern, instilling boundless confidence, fearlessness, and candor. In the frigid, lonely, and unfeeling cosmos, it constructs a compassionate and loving shore. It is the ultimate synthesis of science and theology, resonating with humanity’s ultimate aesthetic paradigm. It is the aesthetic and desire inscribed deep within the human genome, endowing us with courage to endure innumerable hardships and sustaining us through moments of profound confusion and darkness.  

Pascal wrote in *Pensées* with a tinge of pathos:  
> "We burn with the desire to find a solid foundation and a lasting final stronghold, upon which to build a tower that can ascend to infinity. Yet in the end, we find our entire foundation shattered, and the earth split into an abyss."  

[The reality may be closer to this: every tower we passionately construct is never truly toppled. We dismantle it only to build a taller one atop its ruins, leveraging accumulated experience and knowledge. Upon closer inspection, every newly erected tower bears the shadows and spirit of the past ones, as if they had never been toppled at all.]()
