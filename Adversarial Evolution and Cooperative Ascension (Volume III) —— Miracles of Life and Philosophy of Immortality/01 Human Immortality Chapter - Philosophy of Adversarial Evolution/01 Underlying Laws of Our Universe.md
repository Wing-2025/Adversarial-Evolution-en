In this book, we will continue the discussions from Volume I and Volume II, combining the theories of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension to explore a series of more ultimate questions. Many of these questions are ones that people care deeply about but have long struggled to find answers to. They include: Is human nature fundamentally virtuous or evil? Do we dislike involution because we cannot compete? What is the value of religion? Will scientific development alone guarantee a bright future for humanity? What practical value do virtual world technologies like games hold? Why can AI never replace humans? Which is superior—collectivism or individualism? How can we resist nihilism? How can we face death with greater composure? How can humanity achieve immortality? What is the meaning of human existence? How can we live with dignity, pride, and a profound sense of happiness and hope?  

# The Underlying Laws of Our Universe  

First, let us attempt to summarize some of the physical laws underlying the life evolution phenomena discussed in Volumes I and II.  

## The Driving Force of Life Evolution  

The trajectory of all things’ evolution is determined by the underlying rules of our universe. However, these rules are difficult to describe precisely. I will offer a less rigorous but approximate account:  

1. When a material assemblage develops an "autonomous will" to maintain its own "physiological functions" for the purpose of genetic inheritance, we refer to it as "life." Life is a recursive concept—only when such a material assemblage possesses an "autonomous will" can it "devise means" to sustain its "functionality" (which includes the "autonomous will" itself), thereby enabling it to continue performing "autonomous" actions that preserve its "integrity" and "functionality."  

2. The universe is a vast parallel "computer" with finite energy storage. At equivalent technological levels, parallel systems possess far greater energy and computational potential than serial systems. Thus, the energy potential of cooperative assemblages exceeds that of individual entities.  

3. The larger the material assemblage constituting "life" and the higher its internal coordination (i.e., the lower its internal friction), the greater the potential energy and capability it can generate. This enhances its ability to maintain its "autonomous will." Since the "autonomous wills" of different "life" forms may conflict, those with greater energy and capability are more likely to preserve themselves when their "autonomous wills" clash with others—thus better able to assert their "autonomous will" and sustain their "functionality" and "heredity."  

4. When multiple "life" forms cooperate closely, each component surrenders a portion of its "freedom" to expand the total mass and energy of the assemblage, thereby facilitating the realization of their "autonomous wills." When their cooperation is synchronized and seamless, they may be regarded as a larger "life" form. The potential of cooperation far exceeds that of individual actions. Cooperation generates order; order generates synergy; synergy prevents the cancellation of forces and energy loss in chaotic systems; synergy also enables "subjective initiative" and "free will" unattainable in non-cooperative states. Synergy can transform from quantitative to qualitative change, giving rise to entirely new high-dimensional capabilities. These autonomously controlled energies empower cooperative entities to better maintain their "integrity" and "functionality." This enhanced computational power endows them with stronger "foresight" and "foresightedness," enabling more precise realization of their "autonomous will" and better protection of their "integrity," "functionality," and "heredity."  

5. Over large temporal scales, matter and energy are conserved. For life systems with high cooperation degrees, matter and energy approximate infinity—what matters is the extent of cooperation and how they are cyclically and renewably utilized. Higher cooperation degrees enable more efficient cyclic use of matter and energy.  

From various signs, we infer that the cooperative dividend is an underlying law of our universe, sustaining life evolution over billions of years. If this universe were to lose this meta-law, there would be no complex life forms, no human brains, and no human society. Without these underlying laws, the world would likely present an entirely different appearance—far from the vibrant, tender, and warm blue planet we see today. The cooperative dividend is also the basic assumption of my series of discussions. It serves as the fundamental axiom of the entire Adversarial Evolution framework. If it holds, all subsequent inferences follow logically. If it is false, the entire framework’s conclusions may collapse. Fortunately, this law has been repeatedly verified by Earth, a massive experimental field, over billions of years. From the micro to the macro, from the simple to the complex, from marine to terrestrial life, from animals to plants, and from autonomous movement to the emergence of intelligence—all have upheld this law.  

## Two Worldviews of Life Evolution  

Life evolution is a fascinating process. On the surface and beneath the surface, it follows two nearly opposite sets of evolutionary rules, which are indirectly determined by the laws of the physical world.  

The most accessible and explicit life rule is that limited resources lead to mutual competition among life forms, ultimately resulting in involution and mutual harm. This rule is widespread, observable not only in the visible multicellular biological world but also in the invisible microbial realm—ubiquitous across space and time, spanning billions of years, deeply entrenched.  

However, another hidden, less explicit rule is equally entrenched: life continuously ascends in dimensionality through mutualistic cooperation, subjecting non-ascending opponents to dimensionality reduction attacks, and extracting nearly infinite matter and energy from finite time and space through emergent capabilities. The essence of "the strong preying on the weak" can also be seen as high-cooperation groups defeating and eliminating low-cooperation groups. Thus, mutualistic cooperation, emergent dimensional ascension, and the tendency toward infinite resources constitute another main thread of life evolution.  

The same phenomenon and process can be explained in entirely different ways and viewed through entirely different lenses—a testament to the fascination of life phenomena. Regardless, these two seemingly contradictory descriptions share a consistent essence. To determine which is "more correct," we must understand the ultimate fate of life.  

What is the end of the cycle of life competition, ascension, renewed competition, and renewed ascension? Either life and its nurturing environment are completely destroyed in excessive competition, leading to the extinction of life and cosmic silence—a fate more likely for higher-dimensional life—or, after innumerable near-extinctions, individuals repeatedly turn the tide until the ultimate cooperative maintenance mechanism for dimensional ascension is realized, leading to a world of great harmony. It goes without saying what kind of outcome humanity pursues, what role humanity will play, and what mission humanity is entrusted with.  

## Why Must Humanity Cooperate?  

### Sufficiency  

Let us first analyze this from the perspective of sufficiency—i.e., what benefits cooperation brings.  

First, cooperation leads to the emergence of capabilities, which manifests as an exponential power law. Human intelligence is no exception: without the cooperative scale of 40-60 trillion cells in the human body, human intelligence cannot emerge. If humans cannot form large-scale cooperation and division of labor among individuals, the human brain itself would become a burden, let alone enabling group intelligence or social intelligence. I believe readers who have followed from Volume I to Volume III already strongly agree that [humans are a species designed for cooperation and have succeeded because of cooperation].  

[The fact that intelligence makes leaps with increasing cooperation scale has been replayed and confirmed by the modern artificial intelligence revolution.] Computer processors achieve explosive growth in computational power and intelligence by continuously expanding cooperation scale, merging computational units, and ascending in dimensionality. This process unfolds roughly as follows: CPUs integrate more transistors; CPUs integrate more cores; GPUs further group these cores (into "Grids") and provide multiple core groups to enhance performance. This progresses to distributed computing, cluster computing, and cloud computing. Current cloud computing capabilities based on GPU clusters have already outperformed human intelligence in most board games; ChatGPT further demonstrates the comprehensive strength of multimodal AI, even passing the Turing Test. This large language model technology also strikingly illustrates that as the number of model parameters (neurons) increases—i.e., as the number of cooperative units grows—the ability to solve downstream tasks undergoes a phase of abrupt, exponential growth. It [quantitatively confirms the existence of emergent phenomena].  

Emergent phenomena are also the most promising, explosive, elegant, moving, and aspirational aspect of the cooperative dividend.

I often reflect: without societal civilization and the help of others, I would struggle to survive. Placing me in a jungle, I might not even last a single night. My alertness diminishes during sleep, which allows my brain to rest fully—yet insufficient sleep significantly reduces my creativity and imagination. Even when I focus intently on thinking, my alertness to the surroundings plummets, leaving me nearly defenseless against threats. When I am not thinking deeply but highly alert to my environment, I can detect the sound of insects crawling or flapping wings—but at the cost of being unable to enter a state of deep thought.

For an individual isolated from society, one might spend a lifetime inventing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; summarizing the cyclical patterns of the four seasons; or gaining a basic understanding of astronomical calendars—these would already count as remarkable achievements. Such a person could scarcely fathom the intricacies of calculus, linear algebra, matrix theory, geometric manifolds, or computer programming, let alone partake in the flourishing software era nurtured by the hierarchical cooperative ecosystems of computer programs. The layered abstraction levels of modern software and hardware elegantly exemplify the quantum leap in productivity driven by human large-scale cooperation. From hardware to operating systems, driver layers, programming languages, application frameworks and UI frameworks built upon these languages, algorithm libraries, and finally specific application layers—none of these tasks could be completed by a single individual over an entire lifetime, not even a small sub-module. They resemble a grand palace, requiring different people to first craft construction tools, develop material transportation methods, deliver resources, and then have skilled artisans build the palace tier by tier. Cooperation has endowed humanity with entirely distinct worldviews and cosmologies, enabling us to grasp cosmic laws and harness all things. In a sense, humanity is a species forged by cooperation, a quintessential product of life’s cooperative evolution. So long as the number of cooperative individuals is sufficiently large and their relationships sufficiently intimate, even ants could comprehend algorithms, and turkeys might exhibit quasi-divine wisdom.  

### Necessity  
From another perspective, cooperation—or rather, justice and virtue—is indispensable. The necessity of cooperation has long been recognized by sages across ages. For instance, most of *The Republic* revolves around proving this very point. In Socrates’ debate with Thrasymachus, Socrates incisively notes: “For it is injustice that causes factions, hatred, and strife among themselves, while justice brings harmony and friendship.” Thus, justice wields power, whereas injustice diminishes the strength one possesses. Socrates further argues: “Stirring up injustice is only half the evil of injustice, for utter evil and injustice render one utterly incapable of action.” In his interpretation of *The Republic*, Professor Luo Xiang summarizes: “Virtue aids virtue, virtue contests with evil, and evil combats evil; those of virtue emulate the worthy, while those of evil abandon principle for profit.” This is an astute summary. The ultimate goals of the virtuous are aligned—they are *ultimately self-consistent*—whereas the *self-destructive nature* of evil knows no bounds, rendering it *ultimately contradictory*. This reveals the fates of cooperation and non-cooperation.  

However, one logical gap remains. Some might wonder: Could we achieve a steady state between virtue and evil—avoiding extreme evil, leaving room for some virtuous individuals, and exploiting them to sustain long-term prosperity? Might this not lead to an evolutionarily stable state? I term this the “*Steady-State Conjecture of Moderate Evil*.” Several evolutionary dynamics shatter this hope.  

#### Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression  
First is the *Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression*. Some may think: Petty theft, minor embezzlement—unnoticed, harmless to the broader economy. Yet such individuals will inevitably seek to influence social laws, institutions, and even unwritten rules to evade punishment. This opens a small cultural breach, emboldening those committing moderate theft or embezzlement to take greater risks, pushing further toward evil. To protect themselves, they will further manipulate social systems and culture, creating space for major theft and embezzlement. The earlier petty wrongdoers are then outcompeted and淘汰 by the more extreme ones. Worse, once evil gains genetic advantage, it spreads rapidly: the proportion of evil increases, virtue diminishes, minor evils mutate into major ones, and these evildoers, starved of exploitable targets, descend into mutual内卷. Many who triumph through evil see their own descendants turn on one another. *Unless evil is eliminated by Virtue Selection and Group Selection, it will inevitably escalate and progress—this is the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression we discussed earlier.*  

China’s two-thousand-year history vividly illustrates this. The progression of grabbing has repeatedly left the nation vulnerable to marginalized peoples. Though the nation has produced individuals of extraordinary wit, their intelligence has often been channeled into power struggles or self-preservation, with only a few dedicating themselves to national survival. In most historical periods, such internal strife has culminated in existential crises. This makes China’s history a rare and invaluable case study, offering profound insights into the helplessness and futility of a world dominated by the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression.  

By contrast, humanity’s rise above other species stems from its choice of an evolutionary path diametrically opposed to infighting. Only by transcending local victories and defeats, and broadening our perspective to encompass the grand sweep of human and life history, can we clearly discern this evolutionary trajectory.  

#### Group Selection  
The second dynamic shattering the “Steady-State Conjecture of Moderate Evil” is *Group Selection*. Why is cooperation the ultimate theme of life, even as it becomes increasingly susceptible to the backlash of cooperative forces? For apex predators, non-cooperation may sustain them temporarily, but it cannot achieve an *evolutionarily stable state*, as a new species will inevitably evolve with higher-order cooperative abilities to supplant them. This trend is evident in archaeal-bacterial endosymbiosis, the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life, and the Holocene human leapforward event. All evolutionary offshoots of life—including more complex archaeal endosymbiosis, other forms of multicellular life, superorganisms, and eusocial species—exhibit this pattern. Over billions of years, life has persistently, ingeniously, and relentlessly pursued this evolutionary trajectory.  

This is not to say that non-cooperation or failure to ascend dimensions precludes survival. Rather, the world will inevitably revolve around the highest-dimensional life forms, which dominate and protect the living world. Humanity now occupies this position. We have not only the necessity, mission, and responsibility to undertake this grand project of life but also the obligation. Ants, bees, dolphins, or orcas? No—humans have commandeered Earth’s largest evolutionary resources and forged symbiotic relationships with thousands of species. The glorious and arduous task of Dimension Ascension falls to humanity alone. *Preserving Earth and the life community we have built is the only way for post-ascension humans to protect themselves—all rise or fall together.*  

Individuals or groups that disrupt this symbiotic harmony, or act out of self-interest, must be treated as cancerous cells or diseased tissues to be excised from the life community. Here, we must remain vigilant: the higher the dimensionality of a civilization, the more it depends on cooperation, yet the more vulnerable it becomes. Even minor missteps can incur enormous risks, as cooperative forces—such as technology—carry immense destructive potential. Nonetheless, the highest-dimensional cooperative life forms in the universe will inevitably be the most “free” and likely the only “free” beings. All other life forms will likely be swayed by their “will.”  

Throughout life’s evolution, countless extraordinary feats have been achieved in the pursuit of survival through grabbing. Yet the efforts made for cooperation are far more astonishing. Among all these extraordinary species, humanity stands out as the most remarkable. We have traveled the farthest on the path of cooperation and reaped the greatest rewards. This is the path humanity has chosen and must continue to choose. Any individual, group, or supergroup that deviates from this path will inevitably decline. Whether we like it or not, all life forms with the potential for long-term existence must participate in the grand cooperative spectacle of life. Only when they cooperate as if they were a single organism will internal strife cease.  

## Overview of the Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension Theory

Life is shaped both by the environment and by life itself:  

Life advances through competition and thrives through cooperation;  
Life cooperates because of competition, and competes through cooperation;  
Life’s competition consolidates the cooperation of the previous dimension;  
Life’s cooperation enables the Ascension to the next dimension;  
Life’s competition is a means, while life’s cooperation is the end;  
Life’s competition is a process, while life’s cooperation is the culmination;  

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--  

Selfish competition is eternally trapped in involution and nihilism, with all against all;  
Hypocrisyism parasitism in cooperation harbors cancerization and corruption, eroding like a festering sore;  
The Virtue Selection mechanism immunizes the cooperative system against cancerization and defies fate;  
Non-grabbing Competition keeps the cooperative system ever-youthful and metabolizing;  
Linkages across time and space, transcending individual boundaries,  
Dimension Ascension, gradually approaching immortality;  

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--  

Competition for grabbing, cooperation harboring cancerization—plunging into the abyss of sin and evil;  
Competition as non-grabbing, cooperation purged of cancerization—reaching the shore of beauty and virtue;  
Greatness nurtures corruption beneath it, and corruption harbors greatness within it,  
The Chinese nation forges ahead through trials.  

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--  

Heaven and Earth are “devoid of benevolence,” regarding all things as straw dogs;  
All things are “devoid of benevolence,” taking Adversarial Evolution as their guideline;  
Adversarial Evolution is “devoid of benevolence,” ascending through cooperation;  
Cooperation is “devoid of benevolence,” measured by dividend.  

“Devoid of benevolence” begets benevolence; nihilism harbors love; the ordinary transforms into beauty; the sea turns into mulberry fields;  
Life constructs supreme meaning within the cosmos of meaningless nihilism,  
All due to this law.
