# Religion: An "Evolutionary Theory" of Human Culture  
In *The Selfish Gene*, Richard Dawkins proposed the concept of memetics. This refers to ideas or concepts that spread through cultural imitation among individuals and are passed down through generations. Cultural practices that contribute to the success of a group will spread more widely as the group grows. From a young age, I have been a typical materialist—closer to mechanistic materialism—believing that all phenomena in the world can be explained by physical laws and described by procedural codes. I have never believed in ghosts or deities. Influenced by Enlightenment thought and scientific rationalism, I once held a negative view of religion, regarding it as dross of human thought and a self-deceptive trick, and I have witnessed the hypocrisy of corrupted religion and the many disasters it has brought to humanity. However, after deeply understanding the principles of Adversarial Evolution, even from this extreme materialist perspective, I must re-examine with profound reverence the significance and value of religion, humanity’s oldest form of faith-based activity.  

Religion seems to have existed since the dawn of human society; where there are people, there is almost always religion, and it has played a crucial role in humanity’s success as a species. From Neanderthals to Cro-Magnons; from Sumerian mythology to Egyptian mythology; from Judaism to Christianity and Islam; from Hinduism to Buddhism—almost all religions revolve around themes such as animism, karmic retribution, love and gratitude, funeral customs, taboos, and rituals. [The core of religion is essentially a tool for humanity’s higher-dimensional instincts and higher-dimensional culture to seek logical self-consistency. Religion is a cultural phenomenon, and successful religions guide their adherent peoples to survive in inter-group competition. Thus, the religions that have endured through history are, in essence, the result of natural selection and survival of the fittest among diverse cultural forms.]()  

## The Adaptive Advantages of Universal Culture  

### Animism  
Animism, or the belief that all things possess a soul and emotions, has been held by humans since ancient times. Early humans believed that animals, plants, mountains, rivers, stones, and natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning, like themselves, had will and souls. They even believed that the soul was independent of the body—when the body perished, the soul endured. This material concept of the soul, tied to the body, evolved into an immaterial, independent soul that could temporarily or permanently inhabit any object, becoming the deities worshiped by primitive humans, such as the Sun God and Thunder God. Although the specific processes by which soul concepts were transformed into deities varied across regions, ethnic groups, and religions, "animism" remains humanity’s earliest religious concept.  

Jean Piaget’s studies of child development found that animistic tendencies emerge in certain stages of children’s psychological growth. Children often attribute life and intention to inanimate objects, manifesting in their perception of objects and their explanations of causality. As children age, the scope of their animistic beliefs narrows: 4–6-year-olds view all things as alive, conscious, and animate, often treating toys as living companions to play and converse with; 6–8-year-olds restrict animacy to moving objects; and by age 8, they limit animacy to self-mobile entities. This trend reflects that animistic beliefs are rooted deep in human genes, originating from an innate latent ideological state.  

What benefits does this instinctual animistic belief provide to humanity? First, it fosters a benevolent connection between humans and the surrounding world. Consider a scenario: at a tourist attraction, a 4–5-year-old child leans their head through a bridge railing to look at the scenery, only to get stuck with their head outside and body inside, crying in distress. When firefighters arrive with pliers to cut the railing, the child pleads, "Don’t cut it—the railing will hurt!" Humans more commonly project such emotions onto animals. This sentiment prevents humanity from becoming a destructive, grabbing species; instead, it forges a mutually beneficial, symbiotic relationship with the world, enabling the domestication of numerous animals and plants, which have become indispensable parts of humanity’s symbiotic community. Thus, animism establishes emotional connections between humans and all things, and religion provides a logically self-consistent explanation of this concept through doctrinal texts, reinforcing and perpetuating this instinct through culture.  

Second, humanity’s animistic beliefs evolved into the idea of the separation of soul and body, which emerged early—even among Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons, who believed the soul could exist independently of the body. Combined with humanity’s innate gratitude, this naturally gave rise to funeral customs, an ancient cultural practice. Neanderthal graves contain stone tools and animal bones as grave goods. Cro-Magnon burials, beyond stone tools, include colored bones and the practice of arranging the deceased in a fetal position, clearly expressing the hope for a smooth rebirth in the afterlife. These customs reflect gratitude toward the deceased and care for the departed, embodying the psychological expectation of karmic retribution and the immortality of the soul.  

We know evolution is harsh; thus, it never indulges in formality without purpose. Every widely spread culture has profound functions. Yet, using modern scientific knowledge, we easily recognize that funeral and ancestral rituals do not exert tangible effects on the deceased. How, then, have these customs been universally adopted from ancient times to the present? In truth, life education and gratitude culture centered on funeral and sacrificial practices are vital bonds and cultural activities sustaining human society. Their importance is such that human groups lacking these practices or gratitude toward the deceased would struggle to endure. As we will later discuss, the idea of soul-body separation plays a critical role in enabling three-dimensional life to establish time-transcendent four-dimensional connections, ultimately achieving four-dimensionalization. Religion, through doctrinal texts, provides logically self-consistent explanations for these concepts, allowing them to propagate.  

### Karmic Retribution  
Nearly all religions with long historical spans, wide influence, and successful adherent peoples have vigorously promoted the doctrine of karmic retribution. [The core narrative of almost all these religions revolves around karmic retribution.]() For example, in Egyptian mythology, Anubis (dating back to Egypt’s First Dynasty, c. 3100–2890 BCE) guides the souls of the deceased to the Hall of Judgment. There, the soul’s heart is weighed against Maat’s Feather of Truth. If the heart outweighs the feather—indicating a corrupted soul—the deceased is devoured by Ammit, the demoness of destruction. If the heart is lighter or equal, the soul is presented to Osiris, the god of the afterlife, to receive protection in the realm of the dead.

Consider Zoroastrianism, founded between 2000 and 1000 BCE, which profoundly influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This religion is not unfamiliar to the Chinese—under the name "Fire-Worshiping Religion" in *The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber*, it is the predecessor of the Ming Religion (Manichaeism), which once influenced dynastic transitions in Chinese history. The religion’s founder wove the struggle between good and evil, and the idea of karmic retribution, into its core narrative, inspiring imitation by later religions. Zoroastrianism holds that individuals have free will to choose sides in the cosmic battle between good and evil. Reward and punishment in the afterlife depend on one’s piety toward Ahura Mazda and moral conduct. It categorizes human actions into thoughts, words, and deeds, each with good and evil aspects, linking them to heaven and hell: "Good deeds bring good rewards; evil deeds bring evil retribution." The virtuous ascend through celestial realms—first the Heaven of Good Thoughts, then Good Words, then Good Deeds—ultimately reaching the Eternal Heaven of Light. The religion also believes in reincarnation: after death, the soul lingers for four days to review the deceased’s thoughts, words, and deeds. On the fourth day, it crosses the Bridge of Judgment, guarded by dogs. A virtuous soul is greeted by a maiden and guided to heaven; a wicked soul meets a female demon and is led to eternal damnation.  

The Hebrew Bible’s *Proverbs* states: "The righteous will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it. The wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it." Christianity, which evolved from Judaism, has further elaborated the story of karmic retribution. It teaches that before the end of the world, God and Jesus will judge all humanity on Judgment Day. Those who believe in God and Jesus and act virtuously will ascend to heaven; the unrepentant will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone to perish eternally.

The ancient Brahmanism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism that emerged in India have painted even more vivid depictions of the retribution of Virtue and Evil. All of them emphasize karma and the karmic cycle of rebirth. A person may be reborn as a human, an animal, in heaven, or in hell—all determined by the karma (moral actions) accumulated in their lifetime. Among these, Buddhism, the most widely spread, takes the "six realms of samsara" as a core doctrine. This concept posits that all sentient beings, due to the karmic retribution of their Virtuous and Evil deeds, are reborn into six realms: the heavenly realm, the human realm, the asura realm, the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, and the hell realm. Rebirth does not end in one lifetime but continues cyclically across past, present, and future lives. To enable sentient beings to recognize the consequences of their actions, to warn them, and to transcend the cycle of rebirth, the Buddha taught practices such as reciting Buddha's name, accumulating merit, embracing the Dharma, cultivating the self, and pursuing liberation, ultimately aiming for nirvana. The fundamental premise of karmic retribution in religions not only reflects humanity's instinct of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism but also extends this instinct culturally. Religions enable humans to achieve the purpose of Virtue Selection through both instinct and culture. The very reason humanity continues to exist and has not faced extinction lies in maintaining the cosmic order of karmic retribution—a principle as simple as the necessity for a multicellular organism to overcome cancer to achieve immortality.  

### Unity of All Things—The Holistic View  
Almost all widely spread religions manifest a holistic view of the unity of all things. In Western religions, this holistic perspective is often expressed through "pantheism." For instance, Christianity posits that God is the personification of the omnipotent force in the universe; thus, liberation requires returning to this omnipotent force. The Christian Church itself is metaphorized as the "Mystical Body of Christ," where Christ is the head, the Holy Spirit is the soul, and individual Christians are the cells. Though Jesus sacrificed his physical life, he attained eternal life within Christianity. Hinduism and later Buddhism refer to the highest cosmic entity, ultimate reality, or supreme deity as "Brahman," which is the ruler of all things and the fundamental essence of life. Notably, this concept of universal unity encompasses not only spatial oneness but also temporal continuity. Buddhism advocates "no-self" (anatta) or "Brahman-Atman unity," urging individuals to return to the greater self of the whole. This holistic view further developed in Zen Buddhism, as illustrated by the following description of enlightenment:  

> "[I entered. I shed the limitations of my physical form. Of course, I have skin, but I felt as if I stood at the center of the universe. I saw people approaching me, but they were all the same person—all myself. I had never known the world before. I once believed I was created. But now I must revise my view: I was never created; I am the universe. No individual has ever existed.]"  
> —Excerpt from *The Religions of Man* (by Huston Smith)  

Similarly, the Sufi sect of Islam shares a comparable realization. They believe:  

> "[Your existence is a sin, unlike any other sin.]"  

From their perspective, the independence of individual existence signifies the fragmentation of the unified divine. To counter this separation, Sufism developed the doctrine of "fana" (annihilation of the self), seeking the dissolution of self-consciousness as their spiritual goal. They argue that thorough annihilation of the ego reveals no self—only God remains—aligning with Islam's central tenet: "There is no god but Allah."  

In terms of this high-dimensional awakening through holistic thought, Chinese civilization was remarkably premature. For example, Confucius, in the 5th century BCE, concretely proposed the ideal of the "Great Unity Society":  

> "When the Great Dao prevails, the world is a commonwealth. The virtuous and capable are elected; trust is fostered, and harmony is cultivated. Thus, people do not only care for their own parents or children. The elderly are provided for, the able-bodied are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and infirm are all supported. Men have their roles, women their families. Resources are not hoarded but shared; efforts are not exerted for personal gain. Hence, deceit and theft cease, and doors remain unbolted at night. This is the Great Unity."  

Though Confucianism is not a typical religion, it has effectively fulfilled religious functions in the long history of the Chinese nation. Indeed, Plato, across the globe, proposed the *Republic* around the same period, which also embodies a classic holistic vision of human society. During the Axial Age—spanning from the Great Unity Society to the Republic, from Moses to the Buddha—human society underwent qualitative changes in scale. A holistic view became urgent to prevent internal strife and dissipation; civilizations that first developed such cultural frameworks were the ones to endure. Major religions emerged precisely to address this need. Even the rise of Islam in the 7th century CE aimed to resolve intra-ethnic conflicts and enhance cooperation.  

Tagore's *The Religion of Man* elaborates extensively on the holistic view of religions, a topic he deeply understood. Excerpts from his work include:  

> "The principle of the sacred community has always been the principle among the structures within the body, clearly evident in the evolutionary process of early multicellular organisms on Earth. In fact, the perfection humanity can achieve is already manifested within itself.  
>  
> The multicellular body of man is mortal; humanity, as a collective of countless individuals, endures. Upholding this communal ideal, he understands that life is endless, and love knows no bounds.  
>  
> A passage from the Indian *Upanishads* states that this changing world possesses a transcendent wholeness; thus, true joy cannot be built on the satisfaction of greed. Joy becomes possible only when the individual lays down the self and merges into the universal self.  
>  
> Single cells began to aggregate in the past, forming large organisms and the rudiments of life... The components of a living being differ, yet they never undermine the cohesive force that unites and coordinates them. Growth is the goal of life as a whole; to achieve this, each individual member must function tirelessly until death, with new members taking over to continue the task. Each contributes to the achievement of the whole without claiming sole credit.  
>  
> We experience immense joy when we realize ourselves in others—this is the essence of love. Love testifies to the existence of the greater self and is the manifestation of humanity reaching completeness. Love opens an infinite realm where we do not yield to hunger, growls, fangs, or claws; we are not enslaved by limited resources, nor oppressed by cruel jealousy or base deceit, for resonance and cooperation there generate humanity’s greatest spiritual wealth.  
>  
> He is the One, transcending color, fulfilling the innate needs of all people of every hue with His great power; He is the beginning and end of the world, holy and exalted, desiring to unite all in peace.  
>  
> In Sanskrit, religion is called 'dharma,' which extends to mean the ethical principles that bind people tightly together."  

It is striking that Tagore, nearly a century ago, expressed ideas akin to those in this book. Even more remarkable is that the prophets of major religions, thousands of years ago, already grasped the secrets and necessity of human Dimension Ascension. Science today has only just begun to lay the groundwork for explaining this evolutionary phenomenon; it may be long before it is rigorously and universally accepted. In the conjecture of life's Dimension Ascension and its tendency toward unity, religions preceded scientific proof by over four or five millennia.  

Moreover, universal love is an eternal theme of religions, as it is another expression of the holistic view. For love, at its zenith, dissolves into unity—universal oneness is the highest realm of love, a topic we will not elaborate further here.  

The divine nature of religions is almost entirely concentrated in humanity’s high-dimensional life attributes. In a sense, the deities described in various religions are real, unified, and singular:  

> "[It is the Dao; it is Heaven; it is Brahman; it is Yahweh; it is Allah; it is the Great Unity; it is the holistic oneness of the Trinity. Born of the Dao, it creates all things, nourishes all things, deeply loves all things, is all things—it is the symbiotic life whole of the entire Earth, including humanity, and even the entire universe.]"  

## The Corruption and Distortion of Human Culture  

[Just as all human organizations undergo corruption, all religious institutions, over time, have been distorted, corrupted, and even alienated to varying degrees.] Initially, Christians were deeply devout, pure, and noble. However, as Christianity became legally recognized, as being a Christian turned into a social fad, a profitable endeavor, and an indirect means to power, the religion began to corrupt. One hallmark of this corruption was the onset of division and internal strife within the Church. Ostensibly theological debates, these conflicts were in essence factional struggles over who held authority and who represented orthodoxy.

The first large-scale controversy in Christianity revolved around the human and divine natures of Jesus. Amidst this topic—largely incomprehensible to laypeople—internal Christian debates raged, giving rise to doctrines such as Trinitarianism, Arianism, Monophysitism, and Dyophysitism. To the outside world, these theological disputes may have seemed trivial, but for ambitious Christians, they served as a shortcut to seizing leadership and ascending to positions of power. It was precisely this dynamic that transformed a seemingly inconsequential theological issue into a protracted and fierce internal conflict, ultimately splitting Christianity into Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Those who exploited these debates, coveted power, and manipulated factions gradually rose to become the religion’s ruling elite. Meanwhile, genuinely devout and virtuous Christians were marginalized. These power-seekers co-opted supporters of specific doctrines, positioning themselves as their champions. Skilled at advocating for their groups’ interests and advancing their views, they triumphed in internal struggles through *Group Grabbingism*. Yet, their victory fractured Christianity, tarnished its sanctity over the long term, and these same leaders often became the roots of corruption within their own groups once entrenched in power.  

[The history of factional infighting is strikingly similar. Parallel dynamics unfolded within Confucianism, the Donglin Party, and even the nascent (though unsuccessful) activities of the Gang of Four.] Over time, religions have inevitably been reshaped and co-opted by ruling classes, and exploited by hypocrites as tools for moral coercion and profit-seeking. [Thus, any religion in its early and later stages may be regarded as distinct entities—much like many nations that thrive initially but decline later, evolving into different cultural or social organisms. We must view them dialectically and discriminately.] The most prominent, vocal, and seemingly representative figures are often merely the best "performers." Those who truly contribute, possess genuine conviction, and act with prudence are rarely the loudest. The achievements of these unsung heroes are claimed by others, and their reflections and objections are silenced.  

Whether the Pope or holy wars, these do not reflect the true essence or original intent of religion. Actions carried out in the name of religion or morality, especially those loudly proclaimed, may have already deviated from their core principles. As Chai Rong (a Northern Zhou emperor) once said: "Expand the path of virtue to transform hearts. When hearts adhere to the Way, the Buddha is not far. Merely preserving statues does not truly honor the Buddha; practicing the Way constitutes deep reverence." Those who fixate on formalities often betray the spirit of the teachings. [Most of humanity’s noble ideals are severely distorted during periods of "Great Corruption," reduced to tools of formalism and moral coercion.] By then, "religion" is no longer religion, and "Confucianism" is no longer Confucianism. We must adopt a developmental perspective when examining these nominally consistent entities. Only when humanity gains sufficient wisdom to distinguish *Virtue and Evil*—rather than being misled by false narratives—can it partially prevent the erosion of noble ideals.  

So subtle was this distortion that Edward Gibbon attributed much of the Western Roman Empire’s decline to Christianity. He argued, on one hand, that Christianity softened moral resolve:  
- *Erosion of Martial Spirit*: Christian teachings emphasized humility, forbearance, and salvation in the afterlife, weakening the Roman people’s martial vigor and their capacity to resist external threats like the Germanic invasions.  
- *Decline of Rationality*: Christianity’s emphasis on the absolute authority of faith and doctrine stifled rational inquiry and scientific exploration. People ceased pursuing knowledge and truth, sapping societal creativity and vitality, and marking a regression in moral and social progress.  
- *Disruption of Social Order*: Extreme acts by Christian ascetics and fanatics—such as abandoning secular responsibilities in pursuit of personal salvation—violated societal norms, destabilizing family and social structures, and undermining the Roman Empire’s existing moral order.  

On the other hand, Gibbon contended that the proliferation of Christian sects and their bitter struggles for doctrinal authority, religious status, and resources weakened imperial cohesion, exacerbating political and social turmoil. These internal conflicts drained the empire’s strength, accelerating its collapse. Additionally, the resources consumed by church construction, clerical maintenance, and religious organizations diverted funds from critical state projects like infrastructure and military defense, reflecting a moral shift away from the empire’s collective interests.  

[In reality, Rome’s decline was a historical case study of *Individual Cancerization*. The Roman people, having degenerated into greed and moral decay, were in a state of "grabbing decline." Christianity, introduced at this juncture, partially mitigated Roman corruption. However, the religion itself eventually succumbed to corruption and *grabbing degeneration*, with its side effects gradually outweighing its benefits, leaving the empire beyond salvation.]  

The true influence of religious spirit lies in its subtle, widespread impact on broader communities—much like Confucianism, which, though reduced to a political appendage and tool for power struggles in court, remains deeply ingrained in feudal estates and scholar-official families. Hence the adage: "The rise and fall of states concerns the elite; the rise and fall of the world concerns all." Religion, through its subtle influence, strengthens and fortifies its adherent communities, which is why only nations with such spiritual foundations can rise and endure among the world’s peoples. That said, religion’s lack of rigorous scientific grounding is its fatal flaw, rendering it prone to later distortion and exploitation. Most religions have been co-opted, twisted, and misdirected by individuals and small cliques, turning them into tools for personal gain—a point already discussed in my analysis of Confucianism’s limitations, which I will not elaborate on here.  

[These historical facts further underscore the significance of the *Adversarial Evolution* and *Cooperative Ascension* theories. In an era of religious corruption and decline, these theories can, to some extent, substitute for religion’s role.]  

## The High-Dimensional Transitional State  

As discussed in Volume I, successful religions are essentially extensions of the *Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism* instinct. They resolve the conflict between 3D and 4D instincts through "carrot-and-stick" narratives—reincarnation, the afterlife, divine judgment, and the cycle of rebirth—facilitating rapid dimensional ascension. Some may dismiss religion as a deception, but humanity’s 4D instincts are not illusory. In humanity’s pre-enlightenment era, lacking a deep understanding of *Adversarial Evolution* and *Dimension Ascension*, people had to construct self-justifying explanations for the overarching trend of dimensional ascension. Though these explanations were unscientific—even absurd by rational standards—they contained a higher, more ultimate rationality. From a certain perspective, later ideals like "equality, liberty, and fraternity" are no more sophisticated than religion. Are these universal values not another form of "deception" or even "PUA" directed at the masses? Ultimately, both religion and later universal values seek a compromise between high-dimensional ideals and low-dimensional desires. For example, religion incentivizes virtue with the promise of the afterlife; universal values season博爱 (brotherly love) and equality with liberty.  

[In essence, humanity has not fully completed its dimensional ascension; its instincts remain in a transitional state between 3D and 4D. Thus, a narrative that balances high-dimensional ideals with low-dimensional desires—even if deceptive—is the only "menu" that suits their appetites.]  

Many have re-evaluated religion’s role since the decline of theocracy, much as the nearly millennium-long Middle Ages are now seen as a bridge in human history. Religion is far from a purely dark or worthless institution. Alexis de Tocqueville, in *The Old Regime and the Revolution*, noted: "When I began studying the old society, I harbored prejudice against the clergy; when I concluded, I felt profound respect for them." He wrote:

> "Despite the notorious transgressions of certain individuals within their ranks, I cannot recall any clergy in the world more eminent, more enlightened, more national in spirit, less bound by private morality, more possessed of public virtue, and firmer in their faith than the French clergy at the moment the Revolution suddenly descended."  
> 
> "The ecclesiastical authority itself was circumscribed by rules it was compelled to observe. The lower clergy here enjoyed serious safeguards against the tyranny of their superiors, nor did they need to fear bishops using their power to force them into subjugation to the monarchy. I do not intend to pass judgment on this ancient ecclesiastical system; I merely state that it did not in the least prepare the clergy’s minds for political servitude. Moreover, many clergymen were of noble lineage, bringing into the Church the pride and recalcitrance inherent to the noble status. Furthermore, they constituted the upper stratum of the nation, enjoying various privileges. While these feudal rights greatly undermined the moral authority of the Church, they nevertheless, however, endow each clergyman with an independent spirit in the face of secular power."  
> 
> "I have patiently perused most of the reports and debates left by the old provincial Estates-General, particularly those of Languedoc, where the clergy were more deeply involved in public administration than in other provinces; I have also studied the records of the provincial assemblies convened in 1779 and 1787. Reading with the mindset of my own era, I was astounded to find bishops and abbots—many distinguished by piety and learning—drafting reports on the construction of roads or canals, expounding on the rationale with expert knowledge, and exploring from scientific and technical perspectives the optimal means to increase agricultural output, secure public welfare, and promote industrial prosperity. They were on par with, and often surpassed, laymen charged with similar responsibilities."  
> 
> "Contrary to a widespread and deeply entrenched opinion, I assert that stripping the Catholic clergy of all land ownership and converting their income entirely to salaries would only have served the interests of the Roman Curia and earthly monarchs, while the people themselves would have lost a great component of their freedom." Not only Tocqueville, but many later scholars, have re-examined the role of the Church and religion in human history. At times, I feel compelled to apologize, on behalf of classical evolutionary theory, to those who have retained religious faith in the face of "absolute truth"—such as Captain FitzRoy of the *Beagle*. Once derided as a dogmatic defender of traditional religious views, might the scientific community have erred here by being overly unyielding and insufficiently thorough in its inquiry? I believe that one day, we will witness religion and science converging toward the same truth. We should honor men like Captain FitzRoy, who was no stranger to scientific rigor—in fact, he played a significant role in the birth of evolutionary theory, acting as Darwin’s patron. FitzRoy himself made unique contributions to science: appointed as the Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade, he systematically collected port weather and hydrological data, designed barometers installed in every port of the British Empire to guide fishing fleets, and established a telegraph network linking fifteen land-based observation stations to centralize weather reporting. His team grew into the precursor of the modern British Meteorological Office. Yet during the famous Oxford Debate on evolution, where Bishop Wilberforce and Huxley clashed, the fifty-something FitzRoy stepped forward, Bible in hand, earnestly exhorting the crowd to believe in God. His voice was soon drowned out by the clamor of clergymen and students; the tension grew so intense that a lady fainted. After the debate, FitzRoy descended into prolonged depression. Consumed by guilt—believing his invitation to Darwin had unleashed "blasphemous" ideas—he took his own life with a razor five years later, while still a vice-admiral. Friends raised a small fund to support his widow and daughter, including £100 from Darwin himself. FitzRoy was a man who prioritized his moral instincts over evolutionary theory, even though he had helped birth that very theory. Instead of claiming glory, he clung to his faith and ultimately chose martyrdom. Perhaps he was a dogmatist, but his religious conviction also made him acutely aware of the dangers of evolutionary theory—dangers later realized in the eugenic overtones of fascism and racism. His scientific rigor left him unable to refute evolution, yet his conscience rebelled. He felt he had opened Pandora’s box, and this tormented him. Today, it is time we help him close that box. We may one day need to re-evaluate religion—a flawed framework with potentially correct conclusions. Just as Hayek termed the rejection of group-selected wisdom through pure rational deduction "the fatal conceit," so too is the hasty dismissal of religion—a product of group selection—through recent scientific conclusions a form of such conceit. A similar dynamic played out after the publication of *The Selfish Gene*. Life’s trajectory is not static; it ascends in spirals. The transition from three to four dimensions demands overcoming a critical threshold—a threshold requiring the regression of certain three-dimensional instincts and the cultivation of new four-dimensional instincts. This process of regression and advancement defies the gradualism of standard evolution, making it uniquely arduous—much like the eons it took for two-dimensional life to ascend to three dimensions. Such a transition demands not only great luck but also transcendent foresightedness, which itself requires a higher-dimensional perspective. Religion, through its "fictional" framework, allowed life to pre-enter higher-dimensional states, granting the foresight needed to then develop the instincts required for those states—a masterstroke in life’s history. [Religion may have been the sole path for humanity, in its period of ignorance, to ascend to higher dimensions. Reflecting on the trajectories of all successful civilizations, we increasingly suspect it may be a necessary step in human dimensional ascension. Without religion—before the discovery of evolution, DNA, or even adversarial evolution theory—how could we have proven the necessity of "virtue rewarded, vice punished"? And without upholding this ethical principle, how could a people have endured until the era of cooperative mutualism and scientific progress, where this principle’s importance could finally be validated? I believe it would have been nearly impossible without religion—without this "blind" faith. Even the science that later validated these ideas may have been nurtured by religion. Religion is likely a critical shortcut in humanity’s transition to higher dimensions.] [Religion is an extension of genes—the result of cultural evolution. It was preserved through group selection and natural selection.] Before the advent of market economies, religion played a pivotal role in guiding dimensional ascension. [Likewise, it transformed private interests into public good and three-dimensional instincts into four-dimensional ones—paralleling the later role of market systems.] The spirit of religion embodies humanity’s higher-dimensional consciousness. Even universities and science—forces that later challenged religion—originated from religious roots. In an age of ignorance, religion fulfilled its historical mission: using fictional justifications to achieve correct outcomes, propelling humanity onto the fast track of dimensional ascension. Religion encapsulates value systems that resonate with humanity’s deepest instincts, even if they lack complete logical coherence—relying instead on "benevolent fictions." These values align closely with those encoded in our genes, honed through evolution. [We may discard religious forms, but as we peel back its layers—like an onion—we find most outer layers to be false, even trivial. Yet what we uncover at the core is strikingly advanced, prescient, and nearly eternal—truths that endure the tests of time and science.] This book reveals that the essence of religion and science are not in conflict but deeply aligned. Within the framework of Adversarial Evolution, religion and science can converge anew. Religion is humanity’s fictional interpretation of genetic wisdom that logic and science struggle to explain—it is part of our cultural genes, a transmission of life’s successful evolutionary experiences spanning billions of years. [At times, religion has outpaced science, reaching near the finish line early and guiding science in turn.] As we delve deeper into Adversarial Evolution, I increasingly find that the core tenets of enduring religions are being validated by science, not the reverse. Science itself, constrained by historical limitations and incomplete understanding, may appear "unscientific" when viewed through more comprehensive future frameworks. At the farthest reaches of scientific inquiry, the shadow of religion lingers.

This simple value system is most likely objectively embedded deep within the human genetic makeup, just as divinity must reside in the depths of the human heart. It is inscribed within the evolutionary trajectory of humanity, a "revelation" of the universal principles etched into our genes over billions of years of evolution. It manifests as a divine miracle in moments of existential crisis for the species, saving humanity and ensuring the survival of our genetic lineage through countless trials and tribulations to this day.  

### The Flaws of Religion (Religion is profoundly significant yet incomplete; such incompleteness pervades nearly all collectivist ideologies)  
This is also why religion has struggled to attain perfection. Later market economic systems advanced human civilization precisely by partially resolving these issues.  

- [Overemphasis on collectivity while neglecting the importance of individuals and the long-term harm of egalitarian resource distribution.]  
- [Emphasis on equality while neglecting the significance of division of labor, often leading to superficial equality and systemic inefficiency.]  
- [Emphasis on "goodness begets good, evil begets evil" but through misleading propaganda, sometimes forcing progress counterproductively.]  
- [Emphasis on universal love while neglecting the danger of "cancerous cells," thereby falling into the trap of reverse selection.]  

This book has exhaustively addressed these three issues, as they represent breakthroughs over all prior collectivist theories. I trust readers now have some understanding of these problems. We will only briefly elaborate in this section, with further discussions to follow.  

First, nearly all enduring religions exhibit strong collectivist tendencies—a natural result of the universal axioms of the Law of Cooperative Dividend and the Law of Grabbing Deficit. However, what all past collectivist ideologies have overlooked is that individual contributions to the collective vary drastically, influenced by personal ability, division of labor, and the challenges faced by the group. Just as a thousand-li horse (a superior steed) requires a thousand-li horse’s rations and exceptional specimens demand selective breeding, individuals in critical roles—such as national leaders or corporate executives—merit greater resource allocation. Only thus does the collective truly benefit. A collective comprises individuals; failing to place high-potential individuals in appropriate roles and maximize their value guarantees its inferiority to collectives that do.  

Second, religions emphasize equality, often pursuing a formalistic equality (Brahmanism and later Hinduism are exceptions). This reflects a "poverty mindset." From the perspective of dimensional ascension, individuals in lower-dimensional states are "formally" more equal, as all life forms, before ascending dimensions, possess comprehensive bodily functions, fight alone, and are homogenized under evolution’s razor. For example, during the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional life, low-level three-dimensional organisms like choanoflagellates and sponges can be viewed as either single or multiple individuals, as their parts are nearly identical. Yet once they transcend dimensional constraints, differentiation accelerates: after the Cambrian Explosion, three-dimensional animals developed highly specialized cell types; bees and ants, having ascended to four-dimensional "superorganisms," exhibit drastic functional differentiation among individuals, with queens receiving far more resources than others. In essence, division of labor is the key to unlocking the boundless potential of high-dimensional life.  

Third, the emphasis on "goodness begets good, evil begets evil." The Christian Last Judgment, Buddhist karmic rebirth, and similar doctrines fundamentally leverage three-dimensional instincts—carrot-and-stick tactics—to coerce virtue. Islam, for instance, offers utilitarian incentives: conversion can expunge past sins; *Quran* 4:74 states, "Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, whether he is killed or triumphs, We will reward him with a great recompense"; *Quran* 3:169 declares, "Do not think of those killed in the cause of Allah as dead. They are alive, provided for by their Lord." Descriptions of Paradise in Islam include "the least reward for those in Paradise is a dwelling with 80,000 slaves and 72 wives, its dome inlaid with pearls, jade, and rubies." Confucianism, by contrast, is more honest; Confucius rarely resorted to false propaganda, at most stating, "The noble person is at peace; the small person is always anxious." On occasion, he candidly acknowledged that noble persons fare worse than small persons. Once, when Confucius and his disciples were besieged by Chen and Cai after being rejected in Wei, Chen, and other states, Zilu complained of their hardship. Confucius replied, "The noble person endures poverty with dignity; the small person, when poor, descends into vice." His point: noble persons silently bear poverty for their ideals, while small persons turn to evil. [Yet both misleading "goodness-reward" propaganda and virtue advocacy have backfired. The former failed to fundamentally elevate three-dimensional life to higher instincts. The latter weakened self-disciplined, virtuous individuals, even leading them to harm.]  

Lastly, universal love. Undoubtedly, universal love is essential for high-dimensional life; viewing all life as a community, it is the glue binding different life forms. Yet a critical flaw persists: how should we treat grabbers, those who destroy the community, or "enemies"? Love them, and we risk annihilation, oppression, and exploitation. Reject them, and we violate the basic tenets of high-dimensional life. This paradox nearly renders religion logically inconsistent. Though humanity has glimpsed high-dimensional awareness, it has never fully resolved this issue. Jesus taught, "Love your neighbor as yourself," even urging love for enemies. Confucius countered, "If you repay enmity with virtue, with what will you repay virtue? Repay enmity with justice, and virtue with virtue." In truth, cross-dimensional thinking clarifies this. Consider a three-dimensional organism—a human body. Does it not cherish every inch of flesh and bone? Generally, yes: one part’s suffering affects the whole. Yet exceptions exist: diseased cells, like tumors—do we eliminate them or love them? Most rational three-dimensional beings opt for excision. For cancer cells, we wage all-out war, even using radiation and chemotherapy (which harm the body) to eradicate these once-healthy cells. To extend universal love to cancer cells would betray the normal cells and those that sacrificed for the collective. Many principles align across three-dimensional, four-dimensional, and higher-dimensional life. Thus, universal love is to be upheld—but with discernment.  

From another angle, cancer cells are no longer normal life; they are pathological, myopic, and destined for extinction, having lost life’s fundamental foresightedness. Loving them means eliminating them, preserving their healthy genetic legacy rather than dragging kin genes into ruin. Life’s ultimate purpose is genetic immortality. [A "life" whose activities ensure its genetic annihilation in the foreseeable future is anti-life, a corrupted form. Cancer cells fall into this category; thus, eliminating them not only aligns with universal love but, in a sense, saves their genes, practicing this value.]  

Of course, universal love is easier to understand and embrace than high-dimensional symbiotic life theories. After all, not everyone grasps cancer’s mechanisms; human genetic memory lacks sufficient data on high-dimensional life "cancer"; and three-dimensional cancer biology has only been uncovered in recent decades. From a myopic perspective, everyone prefers others to embrace universal love, giving all its variants viral propagation potential. Yet Adversarial Evolution’s definition of virtue mandates opposing evil, including indifference to injustice or complicity in it. This may be the greatest divergence between Adversarial Evolution’s virtue/evil and traditional moral views. Many religions and theories start with sharp edges but dull them to gain mass acceptance. My more factual perspective, however, is shunned and unspread because truth is harsh or threatens certain interests.

In summary, these four points [almost all reflect a form of "class-based limitations and class-based self-interest" inherent in religion](). Religion comparatively centrally reflects the "utopian" visions of the underprivileged, yet these are often imprecise and lacking in practicality. This also underscores the significant limitations of democratic systems. If, in the world of bees and ants, every individual held a ballot and voted solely for their own interests, devouring the queen bee or queen ant might well be their choice for maximizing collective happiness.  

Anti-dualism is a principle consistently upheld throughout this book. Whether examining law, market economies, or the religion discussed here, this work employs the analytical tool of Adversarial Evolution to conduct comprehensive and objective dissections of these phenomena. [Through analysis, we observe that all these mechanisms—having exerted profound influence and been widely adopted in the course of human evolution—are imbued with substantial reasonableness and advancement, all serving the grand journey of human Dimension Ascension. However, these mechanisms are also fraught with considerable limitations, and even harmfulness and chronic detrimental effects. Only by gaining clear insight into these aspects can humanity hope to further improve them and progress further.]()
