# Some Proposals for Humanity's Future  

As this book posits, the global village has entered a Sinocentric Crisis, namely the Civilizational Aging Crisis. The rise and fall of Chinese dynasties represent a minor cycle; the rise and fall of different human civilizations constitute a major cycle. Both are bound by the laws of internal Adversarial Evolution, Hypocrisy-driven Cancerization, and Dimensional Collapse within civilizations.  

From an optimistic perspective, if the theories in this book are widely disseminated, if people sufficiently value these theories, and if the concept of Adversarial Evolution is deeply understood and applied to social practice, humanity still has hope of self-rescue. Yet from a pessimistic perspective, the value of this book may not have enough time to mature and take effect, for the world is descending into chaos. The massive Cooperative Dividend generated by the current wave of information and technological revolution is unprecedented, and the scale of the Great Corruption it supports—the duration of corruption, the degree of cancerization, and the scope of metastatic spread of "cancer cells"—is also unprecedented. [What is even more terrifying is that humanity has almost never realized the horror of cancerization in four-dimensional or even five-dimensional life forms.]()  

Some people cling to an intuitive moral view of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" lacking theoretical foundations and practical validation. Others are infatuated with the "Theory of Institutional Omnipotence," believing that a full replication of Western systems led by the United States will ensure national stability and public well-being. They naively attribute the success of Western civilization solely to the construction of social institutions. A larger group has embraced the Hobbesian jungle rules of Social Darwinism, profiting from unscrupulous means and regarding such behavior as the unchanging law of human society, seeing no harm in it. All these groups lack clear cognizance of the essence and underlying laws governing human social operations.  

Still others are mired in the struggles of academic exams, career advancement, and daily trivialities—stumbling, wandering, confused, and preoccupied—with no time for reflection, let alone awakening.  

Humanity, in essence, ascends in dimensions through cooperation and achieves success through dimensional ascension. For all high-dimensional life forms, the most critical defense is against the outbreak of "cancer." Yet the greatest enemy of high-dimensional life—the genes of Hypocrisy and Grabbing—have quietly permeated the world under the veneer of superficial prosperity. The ethnic composition of nations that achieved modern brilliance has been subtly altered. The balance between Virtue and Evil has shifted, yet institutions have not evolved in tandem, and chaos continues to brew. Some remain arrogantly self-satisfied; some frantically seek quick fixes; some shield themselves within the comfort zones of technological progress; some isolate themselves in subcultures; some immerse themselves in the "gentle embrace" of wealth; some live in debauchery; some are at a loss; some avoid confrontation. What is lacking most is a group of people soberly reflecting on coping strategies.  

For those "cancer cells," they may laugh maniacally until their final moments. But for the vast majority of ordinary people, untold suffering—displacement, family separation, and the fragmentation of nations—awaits. From the collapse of Rome at its peak to the near-total reset of civilization after the fall of the "City of God"; from the Han Dynasty’s golden age to the decline of the Jin Dynasty, when the "Five Barbarians" inflicted calamity and the Han ethnicity entered a historic collapse; from the Tang Dynasty’s zenith and the An Lushan Rebellion to the chaos of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms—each brutal historical collapse unfolded within a few decades. We witness the rise of luxurious mansions, the feasting of guests, and the eventual collapse of those mansions. The global collapse now brewing may be far more severe and perilous than any previous localized or regional collapse. Its outcome has no historical precedent; its consequences surpass the scale of World Wars I and II; its trajectory depends entirely on humanity’s wisdom and awakening.  

Cancerization is a process of frogs being boiled in warm water: Grabbing progresses step by step; short-sightedness intensifies incrementally. Those who seek to reverse this trend either face existential threats themselves or see their descendants’ inheritance suppressed, further exacerbating the "cancer." Ironically, those who feign sleep and let the edifice crumble can survive temporarily. Yet their ultimate descent into the endless cycle of the Hobbesian Jungle seems like a Sisyphean mockery and punishment imposed on these survivors.  

Adversarial Evolution and its derivative theories possess clear logical coherence and practical guidance. Drawing on these theories, the following proposals are put forward for contemporary human society.  

## Reconstructing Human Dignity, Confidence, and Faith  

When navigating alone in the dark, the greatest fear is not the absence of light, but the loss of hope to see light. Thus, the most urgent task is to reconstruct humanity’s dignity, confidence, hope, and faith. Against the great tide of Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension, we must re-examine humanity’s origins, experiences, position, and mission. Humanity must clarify why it has achieved the most brilliant success among all living beings, what its greatest strengths are, what its most precious qualities are, and what it can never afford to lose.  

While this book does not endorse absolute genetic determinism, genes directly or indirectly influence the trajectory of human nature. More importantly, once we recognize that cooperation—not intelligence or other factors—is the key to human success, the fallacies of Eugenics, racism, and sexism will naturally collapse. Humanity stands as an unparalleled exemplar of cooperation on Earth; it is the most advanced, unique, and universe-aligned life form known in the cosmos. The upper limit of human nature approaches divinity. At the vanguard of dimensional ascension, humanity has both the mission and responsibility to overcome all difficulties and confusion, leading this vast expanse of starry seas—illuminated by the bonds of life—toward the shore of high-dimensional existence.  

Truly, humanity is so unique, so important, so precious, so great. It represents the most monumental breakthrough in the billions of attempts at Cooperative Ascension throughout Earth’s biological history, propelling Earth’s life forms to a whole new height. Countless great individuals with high-dimensional awareness have contributed to humanity’s dimensional ascension—stars in the sky of history. Among them, we list a few familiar names: Zoroaster, Siddhartha Gautama, Ji Dan, Confucius, Mencius, Plato, Aristotle, Ashoka, Caesar, Jesus, Muhammad, Joan of Arc, Bacon, Locke, Washington, Voltaire, Kant, Adam Smith, Marx, Tagore, Russell, and Mao Zedong. These familiar and lesser-known figures, like brilliant stars, adorn the historical sky, making Earth’s life phenomena shine.  

In terms of high-dimensional awareness, the Chinese nation has an exceptionally distinguished tradition. Great individuals have emerged continuously from the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors through millennia, with few interruptions. Unlike modern celebrities who maintain superficial personas but lack substance, these great figures are genuinely and purely noble, from the core to the surface. They have sustained the high-dimensional life of the Chinese nation, ensuring it has never truly perished even after enduring innumerable Law of Historical Cycles—despite deep "cancerization" of its "organs." This phenomenon is unparalleled in the annals of human civilization. Even in the late Qing Dynasty, after enduring the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance, and the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the backbone of the Chinese nation re-awakened. In particular, Communist pioneers led by Chairman Mao—Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, and countless other Chinese heroes—each with stories radiating the brilliance and legend of high-dimensional life, form a group nearly unmatched in human history.  

Yet the "cancerization" masked by the great social cooperation forged by great human nature is also the most peculiar phenomenon in the life world. The darkness of human nature is as extreme as its radiance. The lower limit of human nature—selfishness, obstinacy, delusion, cunning, self-deception, and deception—is equally rare in the life world. We say wolves are evil, but their evil pales beside human Hypocrisy. Wolfish evil is limited and predictable; they use ferocious appearances to warn others, serving as a link in nature’s food chain. Hypocritical evil, however, is deceptive and [anti-natural](); thus, it is called ultimate evil. The ultimate evil (Hypocrisy) we see today and in history is precisely nurtured from humanity’s ultimate virtue. Without supremely virtuous humans, there would be no supremely evil ones. In strict terms, all humans are virtuous, for in a sense, hypocritical humans cannot truly be called human—just as cancerized cells cannot be called human cells or "one’s own" cells. Their genes have undergone fundamental, organic mutations; they are alienated tumors.  

Thus, overcoming the darkness of human nature is not only humanity’s responsibility but also a necessary pain of growth and transformation, and an unavoidable trial. As the saying goes, "Heaven places great responsibilities only on those who endure great trials." The pain of transformation is indescribable, but only after shedding superficiality does true gold emerge. If humanity can overcome this trial, it will lead the life world to a new height of dimensional ascension.  

## Reforming Education  

In education, Adversarial Evolution, Cooperative Ascension, and Dimension Ascension should be integrated as critical interdisciplinary courses. This should give rise to new disciplines such as *The Origin and Evolutionary Trends of Life*, *The Origin of Humanity and the Causes of Its Success*, *The Evolution of Human Nature*, *Adversarial Evolution Sociology*, and *Adversarial Evolution History*.  

Additionally, education on discerning character and selecting partners should be prioritized. Courses should comprehensively analyze the various scams and manipulative tactics encountered in character judgment and mate selection, along with the Adversarial Evolution principles underlying these tactics. This is not a superficial humanities subject but a logically rigorous natural science. For girls in particular, cultivating a Virtue-oriented Sexual Selection preference holds far greater long-term significance than acquiring other knowledge, and it will inevitably enhance their personal happiness and that of future generations. [In a sense, humanity’s future is shaped by female choice. Ideally, Sexual Selection and Virtue Selection would align perfectly, rendering laws nearly unnecessary.]()

On the other hand, for men in positions of power who bear the societal responsibility of governance, the choice of a suitable female partner is a matter of life and death. While the blame for the downfalls associated with Daji and Baosi (infamous consorts of tyrannical rulers) cannot be divorced from the dereliction of duty by the corrupt monarchs, even a great mind like Chairman Mao encountered significant missteps in partner selection. Constrained by private moral considerations, upon realizing his mistake, he could only lament: "I didn't handle the marriage properly back then; it was hasty. What can I do now? Given my status and circumstances, divorce isn't feasible." This compromise indirectly contributed to the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution, becoming the greatest blemish on the great man. For those at the core of power, mate selection transcends personal matters. Those around them must offer greater support, allow room for error, correct mistakes promptly, and show greater empathy and respect for human nature—they cannot be judged by the standards of ordinary individuals or families. One must remain cognizant that power and wealth attract all manner of malevolent forces, where authenticity and deceit intermingle. Sophisticated egoists, adept at disguise, are particularly alluring with their talents and appearances, yet their fundamental nature of Grabbingism (resource-hoarding) and desire to control others will inevitably amplify through parasitism on power and wealth, culminating in great calamity.  

The theory of Adversarial Evolution is both profoundly complex and surprisingly simple. Its complexity rivals the sum of life’s multifaceted intricacies, for it follows the principle of "one begets two, two begets three, three begets all things." Yet its simplicity lies in a single core tenet: elevating the cognitive capacities of humanity’s decision-making strata, enhancing the ability to discern Virtue and Evil, fostering the Foresightedness of life, establishing institutions to protect such foresight, and appropriately culling short-sighted individuals who impede life’s long-term survival. Mindsets of limitation, competition, comparison, and involution stem from tens of millions of years of survival struggles, deeply ingrained because emergence (qualitative leaps) occurs rarely, and low-dimensional, cutthroat competition dominates most of history. However, humanity, having undergone the Industrial Revolution, Information Revolution, and impending AI Revolution, has no excuse to disregard the boundless energy and allure of cooperation, technology, and emergence. Common prosperity, universal happiness, and human unity are not utopian illusions—material and energy resources are not scarce; rather, they manifest infinite potential with each dimensional ascension of life, from bioenergy to chemical energy and nuclear energy. By ensuring proper metabolism, strengthening immune and anti-cancer mechanisms, and reshaping humanity’s desire systems and achievement orientations, one will recognize that this trend toward unity is a millennia-old convention life has repeated countless times and the nearly singular meaning life can pursue—all other meanings revolve around this ultimate purpose.  

### Reconstructing Institutions and Law  
We must reconstruct legal frameworks, particularly jurisprudence, under the guidance of Adversarial Evolution theory, rather than remaining confined to low-dimensional intuitions of morality and customary practices. Human institutions need continuous innovation and iteration within the theoretical framework of Cooperative Ascension, outpacing the pace of institutional overfitting and Grabbingist decline. Most old institutions are intermediate stages in humanity’s dimensional ascension; some flawed systems even distort human nature. For example, the imperial system: the desire for power was not inherent in humanity’s primitive genes, but as population grew, centralized, intensive governance became a necessity for ascension. The imperial system, the simplest form of intensive management, unified large groups and drastically boosted cooperative capacity. Yet it also created vast space for Grabbingism. Ordinary people struggle to comprehend the imperial family’s obsession with power—having not experienced the brutal elimination within royal lineages, they fail to recognize that survivors of such power struggles develop an innate craving for power, driven by intense anxiety over losing it, leading them to ruthlessly eliminate any threat, including children and siblings. Thus, the flawed imperial system insidiously warped human nature. All past institutions will eventually grow obsolete and overfitted; only continuous renewal can outpace Grabbingist decline. Only by cultivating human nature can more individuals focus on updating institutions, sustaining their vitality, rather than involuting within existing systems or exploiting institutional loopholes.  

In legal enforcement, the integration of large AI models promises to address multiple legal challenges. AI can co-participate in legal arbitration with humans. To ensure the integrity of AI’s big data, it should use multiple randomized, geographically dispersed server nodes to cross-validate conclusions. Before addressing critical issues, AI must first pass tests by randomly selecting 100 out of 10,000 pre-set moral scenarios. Early AI involvement in legal arbitration is of profound significance: [Using the magic of AI to combat the magic of evolutionary cancerization]. This will mitigate the laggardness and improve the fairness of law, transcending the constraints of [legality of crime and punishment], [preventing legal rigidity and overfitting]. AI’s logical reasoning and generalization capabilities can render more equitable rulings, breathing life into static legal texts. [It will make the legal net more comprehensive, infuse Adversarial Evolution theory into all facets of jurisprudence, orient law toward the ultimate goal of shaping instincts, transcend mere legal clauses to achieve moral reasoning, and enable flexible, nuanced, and quantified legal adjudication. Issues of secondary crime and dual dilemmas mentioned in "Deficiencies of Law" will also be alleviated]. Moreover, the fairness of AI adjudication can enhance its credibility as an international dispute resolution tool, potentially becoming a key to addressing Group Grabbingism and [a new generation of Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms]. [AI will revolutionize legislation and adjudication, fostering higher-order Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms—critical for humanity’s dimensional ascension].  

### Reconstructing Property Systems  
Regarding property systems, [it is proposed to legally distinguish between "private property" and "disposable property"—a model of limited private ownership combined with centralized public ownership]. Private property has a maximum threshold: if one’s private wealth exceeds 1,000 times (or up to 10,000 times) the population’s median wealth, they should feel ashamed, as such excess is likely derived from exploiting surplus value. They should also feel fear, anxiety, and injustice, for more unscrupulous individuals could use even more vicious means to exploit their descendants—exploiting their future selves. Thus, capping private property based on the societal or regional median wealth benefits all. Disposable property, however, has no upper limit but is subject to regulatory oversight and policy constraints. Its use should prioritize projects of high value to the long-term interests of high-dimensional life, such as human cancerization resistance mechanisms, protection of the Virtuous, environmental conservation, high-dimensional cooperation rule-building, and basic scientific advancement. Allowing excess wealth to be managed and invested by wiser, more foresighted individuals—rather than distributing it to the masses, which would foster idleness and corruption—better serves society’s long-term development.  

In commercial investment, what constitutes the best investment for successful individuals? True success in any business model or technological innovation fundamentally stems from successful cooperation and the release of Cooperative Dividends. As discussed in Volume I, products like search engines, WeChat, Taobao, and sharing economy platforms exemplify this. For entrepreneurs who achieved immense commercial success by creating such products—wealth they cannot exhaust in a lifetime—what is their best investment? How can they extend their lives and elevate their genetic legacy? Their success arises from their profound understanding of Cooperative Ascension and Cooperative Dividends; thus, their best investment lies in propagating these values and realizing this vision. The more thriving and profound such endeavors, the more their "genetic life" benefits, spreading further and enduring longer. This avoids the fate of "wealth not lasting three generations," where malevolent actors usurp their achievements and disgrace their ancestors.  

### Reconstructing Societal Success Criteria  
As the old "survival of the fittest" evolutionary narrative and hyper-competitive market mentalities veer toward extremism, societal success criteria have been distorted. We must recalibrate these standards using Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension theories. In today’s society, recognizing hidden rules, shortcuts, loopholes, and opportunities in the gaps of power dynamics often brings a sense of enlightenment or relief. Exploiting these rules may even lead to self-satisfaction. Justifying it as "necessary for survival"—given that so many use such rules to achieve petty gains—one may even believe they’ve "grown" or "found the key to success." In reality, these individuals have merely learned to flatter superiors, form factions for profit, exploit crises, exchange favors, suppress dissent, employ PUA tactics, apply double standards, feign goodwill, renege on promises, bully the kind while fearing the cruel, make empty promises, and abandon allies—all at the expense of the community and their own long-term interests. [In truth, these philosophies of survival are not new; they have plagued the Chinese nation since its early days, as seen in texts like *Preparing for the Inside*, *Treatise on Officials*, *Thick Black Theory*, and *Hidden Rules*. These doctrines have poisoned China for over a millennium. The more adept one becomes at them, the more their compatriots suffer, the more their descendants endure hardship, and the more they themselves become the people they once despised]. While some, like Pan Yue and Wang Yan, face immediate retribution, most see their karma visited upon their offspring. In fact, [the "key to success" they find is a key to hell].

### The Truly Wise Path  
The truly wise approach is to thoroughly expose the hidden rules that emerge due to the absence of the Virtue Selection Mechanism, thereby prompting institutional efforts to identify and address gaps and rectify these issues. Actively advancing just institutions and upholding those who defend justice—rather than bullying the virtuous, fearing the wicked, or currying favor with power—is for the sake of your fellow countrymen, your descendants, and yourself. This is the genuine path to success.

### Reconstructing the Concept of Happiness  
Life’s evolutionary trajectory does not inherently aim for universal individual happiness or the fulfillment of every desire. While such a vision is appealing, a world structured this way would collapse swiftly, on the brink of decay. Even the peak of the Roman Empire, which amassed wealth from across the globe to sustain its populace, could not afford endless indulgence in hedonistic “happiness” for its people. Life’s essential evolutionary trend is to ensure happiness for all virtuous individuals, excluding those driven by grabbingism. Thus, we observe that species with higher degrees of cooperation fare better than those mired in solitary struggles or internal strife. Humanity, the dominant land species, and orcas, the ocean’s apex predators, exemplify virtue and cooperation.  

To clarify: the life world supports *Compatible Happiness*, not *Exclusive Happiness*. Cooperative happiness is compatible—meaning the well-being of individuals aligns with the group’s; grabbing-driven happiness is exclusive—individual gains come at others’ expense. At first glance, Compatible Happiness seems to defy the logic of natural selection, difficult to establish and even counter to instinct. Yet, it has taken root across life’s dimensions: from the prokaryotic components within eukaryotic cells, to individual cells in multicellular organisms, to superorganisms like ant and bee colonies, where each member’s happiness is compatible. Humanity once achieved this compatibility too; compassion and empathy are evidence of this trend, uniting the happiness of the entire species.  

Today, the impulse to extend love and kindness to others faces unprecedented suppression. The desire for human connection is increasingly constrained, as people fear exploitation, harm, or manipulation. This is a sickness and regression in human society. The force of degenerative grabbingism is powerful—its genes spread like cancer, and a single misstep could lead to irreversible collapse.  

The Chinese have historically exhibited strong desires for power, sometimes to seemingly irrational extremes (consider figures like Empress Wu Zetian). For centuries, power alone has been seen as a guarantee of security; in critical moments, promises, alliances, or even wealth prove as fragile as paper. Only coercive force—whether through military might or deception—has been perceived as capable of controlling one’s fate and preserving one’s genes. Yet power is inherently scarce. Until the system that equates power with genetic survival is dismantled, a world of mutual harm, suspicion, and predation cannot be transformed, and the Hobbesian Jungle will remain inevitable (hence the paramount legal status of procedural justice, which seeks to place law above power).  

The utterly *Exclusive Happiness*-driven individual is a tragic figure. They view resources as finite, believing they must seize more through competition. When their lives are stifled, they seethe with resentment, bitterness, and envy; when they achieve success, they are consumed by insecurity, paranoia, and restlessness. *They are, in essence, unhappy whether they succeed or fail*. Their life’s motivation clashes with others’; they dare not fully expose this motivation, trapping themselves in endless isolation and fragmentation. Reducing such life forms is, in fact, a form of redemption for them.  

The ultimate form of Compatible Happiness is the happiness of symbiotic communities. It does not require extreme restraint or self-sacrifice for others, but it does demand that individuals act with long-term vision for the community’s beneficial evolution. It differs from postmodern, titillation-style happiness—pursued for fleeting pleasure—unless such pleasure is deeply aligned with the life world’s long-term interests; otherwise, it is merely a degenerative, grabbing-driven mutation of pleasure.  

Humans possess not only base desires but also *high-dimensional desires*, a key distinction from other animals. We plan for the future and are moved by the well-being of humanity and the planet. A hyper-competitive society commits its gravest error by implicitly rewarding the relentless pursuit of short-sighted goals while punishing those who uphold high-dimensional, long-term ideals. Drug use, for example, is a dimensional downgrade for high-dimensional life. Why do most humans resist the allure of immediate ecstasy from drugs? Because the fear of drug-induced harm and the hope for a better future outweigh the desire for transient pleasure. Humans are not content with the status quo; we are the only species that plans ahead and gazes at the stars. Our foresightedness surpasses that of all non-human life.  

*For far too long, human institutions have merely exploited instinct and catered to human nature—this is insufficient and even counterproductive, akin to draining a pond to catch fish. For human society to endure, we must instead reshape instinct and human nature; otherwise, society will collapse amid degenerative grabbingism. Conversely, if we shape instincts wisely, we can achieve a world where individuals are “indulgent” and “free” while society evolves toward enduring beauty.*  

The truth of life—its intricacy and beauty—evokes wonder. Life’s history is also a struggle against “cancer cells” in every dimension. Every “pore” and “drop of blood” of life is infiltrated by grabbingism, yet life overcomes this with extraordinary resilience, wisdom, and countless miracles—feats unimaginable to the non-living world. These are stories of magic vanquishing magic, and to delve into them is to be moved by love, courage, dedication, and sacrifice.

### Rights Are Not Inherent; Maintaining Cooperation Has a Cost  
First, we must discard the notion many take for granted: natural rights. In truth, the discourse of natural rights is no more valid than the divine right of kings. Rights are a fictional construct; life itself has no inherent rights. Heaven and earth are impartial, treating all things as straw dogs. When individuals invoke “universal values” like “everyone has the freedom to choose their way of life” or “my life, can’t I decide for myself?” to evade moral judgment, *we must recognize that these arguments serve only the temporary needs of capitalist market economies and cater to self-deception, far from being truths*.  

The logical flaws in these values are evident: if everyone has the freedom to choose their lifestyle, should cannibals and murderers’ “freedoms” also be protected? If every life must be self-determined, should we seek a child’s consent before birth? A world built on such values is inherently unstable.  

Where, then, do rights come from? They are not gifts from the heavens. Rights are bestowed by human society, by virtuous mechanisms, by humanity’s great Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms—Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism, law, and the market. They were forged by our ancestors, who stood united, braved bloodshed, and overcame threats: predatory beasts, natural disasters, and civilizational conflicts. That we do not live in constant fear of the Hobbesian Jungle or a “Dark Forest” of ruthless predators is owed to these ancestors and all who serve the people.  

*Thus, rights are not without cost. We cannot enjoy rights while failing to contribute or sustain these Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms.*  

*In fact, as life ascends dimensions, the cost of maintaining cooperation rises sharply.* For example, maintaining cooperation in eukaryotic cells is far simpler than in multicellular life, which has evolved complex immune and anti-cancer systems—targeting not just external invaders, but internal degenerates. For social life formed by multicellular organisms, the difficulty of cooperation maintenance escalates further.  

Moreover, as human society ages—analogous to an aging multicellular organism—the “incidence of cancer” (social degeneration) rises exponentially, increasing the demand for “anti-cancer systems” (cooperation maintenance systems) to unprecedented levels. Later-stage human societies must invest drastically more resources in cooperation maintenance: legal professionals, police, supervisory agencies, and anti-corruption bodies must expand to counter growing risks of social grabbingism and cancerization.  

As the most intelligent life form, humanity must possess self-awareness and gratitude. Otherwise, if cooperation can only be maintained through enslavement or domestication—like endosymbiosis or human-tamed animals—it may persist, but at a steep moral cost.

### The Cross-Temporal Mirror Reflection of Grabbing Behavior  
The sole distinction between life and non-life lies in foresightedness. The higher the life form, the greater its foresightedness. A life form without foresightedness is no different from a handful of sand. If you are alive, you possess the potential for foresightedness—no matter how distorted by culture, your life’s essence will one day awaken.

The harms we suffer today and will endure in the future from all forms of grabbing behavior are [nearly all mirror reflections of grabbing behavior within the genetic evolutionary space](). Just as you indifferently refuse to help someone in need, only to find yourself in urgent need of help with no one to assist you, this is essentially a form of self-inflicted retribution—or a cross-generational karmic consequence of genetic traits. If your genes once witnessed unjust phenomena or others suffering from injustice, and you benefited by feigning ignorance, or even exploited, amplified, and indulged in such injustices, your genes will inevitably face repercussions in other ways across future generations. Most of the current inequalities, pressures, and crises we confront stem from the arrogance of our own genes in past generations. This is a cross-generational retribution.  
<p align="center"><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d889d2-2fc9-4cf4-886c-39f2dcd9bfe7" />  
</p>  
Even from the perspective of scientific personal identity, who can claim that the future self bearing the consequences of past misdeeds is not "another self"—or even the very same self? In this regard, religions have indeed shown profound foresight. How can we avoid such tragedies? It is surprisingly simple: reflect on ourselves, treat virtuous individuals with kindness, and suppress evildoers. Only through this can our genes gain a chance at purification—at the very least, the similar genetic traits embedded in others will propagate. When we begin to think about the distant future, feel remorse for past actions, grasp the principles of this book, and spread its values to more people, the deadlock of enduring suffering in the present and future may finally be broken. Only from the moment we choose to change will the "Izanami" curse be lifted, and the mirror-like cycle of grabbing behavior be terminated. This theory also serves to alert those caught in long chains of evil. As we previously noted, ["when the chain of evil grows sufficiently long, individuals at each link perceive themselves as innocent"](). So long as a self-justifying grabbing system exists, and no one within it commits overtly heinous acts, this self-justifying grabbing template becomes replicable—a common pattern in which "tumors" emerge in human society, as seen in gangs and pyramid schemes. [When we find ourselves within such a system that grabs externally while granting favors internally, benefiting from it, our stance is insidiously altered, and our judgment corroded by self-interest. At such moments, self-awareness becomes critical. Due to the mirror reflection effect of grabbing, the same grabbing patterns will eventually be inflicted upon ourselves across different times and spaces](). The true solution beneficial to all lies in identifying these grabbing paradigms and eradicating them through institutional means.  

### The Dual Degeneration Effect of Grabbing Behavior  
Grabbing behavior not only triggers self-harm through mirror reflection but also induces the dual degeneration effect. A classic example is the breakdown of mutual trust between genders due to extreme grabbing. Women may seek multiple providers before childbirth, while men may shirk responsibility post-childbirth. Over time, this erodes the relationship from close cooperation to mutual suspicion, reciprocal grabbing, and ultimately, a collapse where neither party marries or reproduces. Similar dynamics unfold in doctor-patient relationships, superior-subordinate interactions, employer-employee ties, buyer-seller exchanges, and relations between ruling and ruled classes. When both parties in a cooperative relationship abandon moral boundaries to maximize their own gains through grabbing, it is the principled cooperators—those who uphold mutual benefit—who are eliminated. This process follows a pattern: the two parties alternately cull "good" individuals from each other’s ranks, reducing the number of empathetic, cooperative members in both camps. This exacerbates intergroup antagonism, intensifies grabbing tendencies, and degrades the cooperative relationship—a phenomenon we term the "Dual Degeneration Effect." [The Dual Degeneration Effect is defined as: when both parties in a cooperative relationship engage in unbridled grabbing, they alternately eliminate "good" individuals from each other’s camps who adhere to cooperative principles, leading to heightened antagonism, intensified grabbing tendencies, and the sustained degradation of cooperative relations. At a small scale, this causes mutual alienation between genders; at a large scale, it fosters entrenched mutual hostility between nations, triggering reverse evolution and collapse at the civilizational level](). Over time, society is left with only those holding extreme stances, relentlessly extracting maximum benefits from the opposing group or camp. When both parties prioritize self-enrichment over generating cooperative dividends, the entire civilization degenerates—even regressing to a Hobbesian Jungle state.  

### Grabbing Degeneration Is the Norm—Resisting Degeneration Is a Science  
As we have repeatedly emphasized, due to the inevitability of genetic mutation, once group selection stagnates, evil and cancerization within the group will accumulate, making grabbing degeneration inevitable. Combating such degenerative and cancerous tendencies is the most critical and life-or-death challenge in humanity’s ascension to higher dimensions. [Just as 3-dimensional life, regardless of escaping all other diseases, inevitably succumbs to cancer; all 4-dimensional and even 5-dimensional life—human civilization—has never evaded the Law of Historical Cycles. This is a subject that sends shivers down the spine of all who possess higher-dimensional awareness]().  

#### Chairman Mao’s Lifelong Adversary  
Chairman Mao was one of the rare individuals in human history to attain higher-dimensional awareness at a young age (as reflected in *The Power of the Mind*, where he wrote, "The cosmos is my mind; my mind is the cosmos"). With foresight and profundity, he engaged in in-depth discussions with Huang Yanpei about the Law of Historical Cycles as early as the Yan’an Period. In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, rather than merely preventing the "restoration of capitalism" or "prevalence of bureaucracy," his deeper motivation stemmed from detecting signs of renewed cancerization in Chinese civilization. After prolonged contemplation in Dushuidong, he made the fateful decision—a choice as conflicted as a cancer patient deciding whether to undergo chemotherapy. I believe that escaping the Law of Historical Cycles was the primary impetus for Chairman Mao to launch the Cultural Revolution in his later years.  

Wang Li, one of the early promoters of the Cultural Revolution, recalled:  
> The Chairman had long observed that from the central government down to grassroots party branches, many had become "independent kingdoms." If you didn’t probe them, they appeared normal—model units, labor heroes, and NPC deputies. But scratch the surface, and almost all had issues. Many operated like feudal lords (dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, barons), alienating the Communist Party from the masses. What could be done? This was a problem that kept the Chairman awake at night, a problem that had to be solved. Many "red-flag" units, when investigated, revealed issues. There were numerous "local emperors" with inherent economic privileges and extra-economic political power. A single word from these local emperors was law—they could arrest people at will, and opposing them was labeled as anti-party, anti-socialist, or counter-revolutionary. If this continued, the Communist Party would be overthrown by the people.  

> The Chairman repeatedly asked: What can be done? Rectifying the Party didn’t work; education didn’t work; rectification campaigns didn’t work; even the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns," which executed major corrupt officials and removed others from office, failed. Then came the "Four Cleanups Movement," a large-scale effort—but it too fell short. Having exhausted all methods, the Chairman resorted to a bottom-up movement, setting the Party aside to let the masses expose its dark side. Thus, the Cultural Revolution was launched as a grand experiment.  

To combat the cancerization of higher-dimensional "civilizational brains"—a problem no one in history had ever successfully halted—Chairman Mao was even prepared to bear eternal infamy. In a letter to Jiang Qing, he self-deprecatingly wrote:  
> "Lofty things are easily broken; pure things are easily soiled. *Spring Snow* (a highbrow melody) finds few to sing along. Great fame often exceeds substance." The latter two lines refer to me. All things tend to reverse. The higher one is praised, the harder one falls. I am prepared to shatter into pieces. That is of no consequence—matter is indestructible; it will merely shatter. When I die, you can hold a celebration. Dress beautifully, preferably in bright red or colorful clothes, and attend the celebration with joy and smiles..."  

Chairman Mao possessed acute insight, identifying issues few others saw. Just as he discerned the pattern of "encircling cities from the countryside" and "a single spark can start a prairie fire," which would lead the seemingly weak Communist Party to victory, he also foresaw that the cancer of grabbing degeneration, like a virus, would rapidly spread, causing the nation to rot anew. Fundamentally, this was equivalent to a generation’s arduous revolution ultimately ending in failure—a fate Chairman Mao most sought to avoid. In his later years, he wept over the line, "What did the Six Dynasties accomplish? Only private schemes for their clans."  

Premier Zhou Enlai, in his later years, commented on Chairman Mao:  
> "When Chairman Mao resolves to do something, you may object, but do not do so lightly. Historically, there were instances where I opposed his decisions, believing them incorrect, but time proved him right. After that, I grew cautious, refraining from hasty opposition. However, there was another occasion where I was convinced he was wrong and firmly opposed him—but again, practice vindicated his decision."  

Constrained by the theoretical limitations of Marxism-Leninism regarding class antagonism, and failing to recognize the Law of Cooperative Maintenance Cost, virtuous individuals often struggle to comprehend the motives and actions of hypocrites, making them prone to deception. Under the machinations of hypocrites—distorting right and wrong, abusing authority, masking their true intentions, and acting perversely—the Cultural Revolution deviated almost entirely from its original intent.

### On Grabbing Degeneration: Insights from Market Economy and Higher-Dimensional Solutions  

In addressing the issue of **Grabbing Degeneration**, we may draw upon the strategies of the market economy—a tool humanity has devised that, despite its significant lingering aftermath, stands as the most astute means to counteract such degeneration to date, verging on "magic." The brilliance of market economic systems lies in their utilization of the instinct for grabbing to achieve the end of cooperation. When preventing Grabbing Degeneration, we find it difficult to transcend the limitations of history and human nature; indeed, we must even harness these very limitations to effect profound change, for otherwise, we risk falling back into cyclical patterns. Here, we must mention another visionary leader, Deng Xiaoping, whose acumen in understanding the market economy as a tool rivaled that of Chairman Mao. His reforms significantly delayed the trend of Grabbing Degeneration. Yet Chairman Mao’s concerns over the excessive exploitation of capitalism and the corruptive tendencies of bureaucracy—at their core, anxieties about Grabbing Degeneration—remain eternally relevant.

#### A More Scientific Approach to Removing Tumors: The Anesthetic of Higher-Dimensional Life  

##### Fighting Magic with Magic  

The grand ambition to resist degeneration demands profound institutional innovation and breakthroughs, akin to the intricate biological mechanisms (e.g., immune systems, anti-cancer systems, telomere restrictions) that life has evolved over eons to prevent cancerization. Cancer is a form of "magic" that defies simple solutions; combating it requires *fighting magic with magic*. Fortunately, we may leverage the theory of **Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity**. For three-dimensional life, if our cells fall ill and undergo **Individual Cancerization**, directly excising them causes immense pain, as they are integral to the body, connected by our neural pathways of sensation. Moreover, healthy and diseased cells intermingle, making precise excision difficult. If the surgeon themselves is a cancer cell, the danger escalates—good cells may be mistakenly eliminated. This mirrors the challenges encountered during the Cultural Revolution.  

In such cases, the pain response of three-dimensional life becomes an obstacle to healing. For four-dimensional life (human civilization), intuitive morality and innate empathy—our "sensation of pain"—may similarly hinder the treatment of civilizational "cancer." Bluntly severing these sensory or moral "nerves" and regressing to individualism is akin to quenching thirst with poison or draining a pond to catch fish: a short-sighted remedy. Here, cross-dimensional analogy offers insight. How do three-dimensional beings address pain during surgery? Through anesthesia—a milestone in medical innovation. Though it numbs nerves and disrupts normal bodily functions, anesthesia is indispensable for eradicating pseudohypocrisy and grabbing within the body. What, then, serves as the "anesthetic" for four-dimensional life? As discussed earlier: the vigorous development of virtual reality technology. For serious offenders, virtualized existence—satisfying their desires while restricting their reproduction—acts as this anesthetic. It mitigates the "pain" of eliminating evil, prevents four-dimensional life from descending into acute mental tension and panic, maintains normal societal functioning, and facilitates the self-awareness and submission of evildoers.  

Cancer cells are wretched, yet they are also a form of illness. Human development and genetic mutation inherently entail decline, distortion, and cancerization. Cancer cells are pitiable. By treating them as patients—satisfying their subjective pleasures and physiological needs while restricting their malignant proliferation (even accepting degenerative reproduction)—we adopt a wiser approach than superficial "punishing evil to deter vice." Suppressing vice drives it underground, indirectly selecting for **Hypocrisyism**, which is counterproductive to long-term societal development. Additionally, limiting extreme, immediate punishment for evil reduces societal suspicion. During the factional struggles of the French Revolution, initially aligned groups eventually fragmented and turned on one another. A key cause was the unchecked power of individuals to wield moral authority, eliminating perceived "immoral" or "unjust" actors without trial. In such environments, preemptive action becomes the norm, as each finds their own "just" rationale. This underscores the intrinsic need to uphold procedural justice.  

If, instead, laws explicitly prohibit arbitrary elimination and instead confine wrongdoers to virtualized existence—satisfying their lower-dimensional desires—two benefits emerge: first, wrongly accused individuals gain time to defend themselves; second, selfish individuals may find such conditions a form of indulgence, leading them to "drift in a dream of low-dimensional satisfaction" and pass away contentedly, preventing their hypocrisy from festering. Satisfying short-term desires is low-cost and effective in "dimensionality reduction" against degenerative life—a far more astute strategy than eliminating them through threats or punishment.

#### Sunlight Is the Best Antiseptic; Streetlights Are the Best Police  

Analyzing vice and human nature through the lens of **Adversarial Evolution**—discerning virtue and evil at their roots—is a powerful means to prevent vice and unmask hypocrisy. We must dare to use the "microscope" of Adversarial Evolution to magnify human nature; challenge conventional wisdom; question authoritative dogma; and confront the abyss of vice. Beyond enhancing our ability to distinguish right from wrong, an effective strategy to reverse degeneration involves *anonymous exposure* of societal grabbing loopholes and *active dissemination* of objective, positive analyses of such phenomena. Through these dual actions—"exposing" and "disseminating"—societal improvement becomes imminent. When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back; if you fear it, pierce through both the abyss and your fear, and it shall no longer exist before you.

### A Transnational Justice League  

**Establishing a global Justice League is of paramount importance.** True virtue transcends time, ethnicity, and skin color; it dissolves all past and future hatred, resentment, and bitterness. For the virtuous are united—their ultimate goals align, even as their faces, skills, roles, experiences, and lineages diverge. Marx and Engels, in *The Communist Manifesto*, declared: "Proletarians of all countries, unite!" (Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!). The essence of Marxism-Leninism and communism aligns deeply with **Symbiotic Communitarianism**. If we replace "proletarians" with "the virtuous," this call becomes profoundly accurate. As previously noted, the primary driver behind humanity’s advancing productivity and rising **Group Cooperation Degree** is **Group Competition** within Adversarial Evolution. In this regard, Sun Yat-sen displayed vision beyond his era. Devoted to the ideal of universal love, he sought international support in rebuilding China, and many foreign friends dedicated their lives to China’s revolutionary cause—figures such as Shōkichi Umeya, Tōten Miyazaki, Tsuyoshi Inukai, James Cantlie, and General Galen. Their contributions should not be forgotten.  

A nation or people is not a monolithic entity; it contains both virtue and evil. Acts of aggression, grabbing, slaughter, and exploitation are localized. Even in such nations, there exist virtuous individuals who oppose grabbing, for their **Foresightedness** tells them such behavior will ultimately harm their own genes. The "genetic kinship" among the virtuous transcends ethnicity and even species. Our ultimate goal is to realize such a Justice League—transcending nations, species, and ethnicities. Especially for the virtuous of the Chinese nation, tempered by millennia of trials and struggles, we hope you awaken and unite early; you will be the vanguard in stemming this tide. Once this league is established, grounded in the origin of virtue, humanity may address **Group Adversarial Evolution** in a truly civilized manner, ultimately fostering group morality, overcoming **Group Grabbingism**, and serving as the cooperative maintenance hub for higher-dimensional life.  

External competition exists to promote and test internal cooperation—not to annihilate rivals. All competition between nations, parties, corporations, and individuals ultimately serves the ultimate goal of achieving better internal cooperation, and nothing else. Mankind must reach an ultimate consensus: the pursuit of **Cooperative Ascension**. This process must be gradual, respecting the mean of human nature and adapting to local conditions—haste is ill-advised. The Justice League should work to establish rules and mechanisms for **Non-grabbing Competition** among individuals, corporations, and nations, creating a "code of conduct for competition" in the new era.  

Competition is the wellspring of life’s progress; without it, life stagnates. Yet competition degenerating into grabbing leads to involution, regression, and even collapse. **The highest art of life’s dimensional ascension lies in stripping grabbing from competition.** From endosymbiosis to multicellular unification, from ant superorganisms to humanity’s capacity for universal love—these are life’s pinnacles of artistry.  

Membership in the Justice League is evaluated by dual criteria: instinctive virtue and rational virtue. Bloodline is a factor to consider: an individual’s virtuous or evil deeds influence the "virtue scores" of their immediate and extended kin, with the primary impact descending (as genetic mutations affect only future generations). Simplified scoring, like that in exam-oriented education, cannot fully reflect true virtue; thus, these scores should serve as references, not definitive standards, with criteria evolving over time and fading across generations.

Even if we employ all possible methods, we may still be unable to completely prevent the cancerization of an aging group. To avoid humanity’s collective cancerization, it is crucial to create relatively isolated geographical regions for nascent groups. This aligns with the natural lifecycle of high-dimensional life—rarely do high-dimensional life forms enjoy extremely long individual lifespans, and beginning anew in a fresh high-dimensional life is often a better choice. These new regions may be environmentally harsh or resource-scarce, ensuring that short-sighted, hypocritical, and grabbing individuals have no incentive to migrate. Through dedicated efforts in these new frontiers, we can likely nurture healthy life anew. Options such as interstellar colonization, sky cities, and undersea kingdoms are all viable. For regions of nations that have degenerated to the point of self-destruction, robust international laws should be established to renew their populations.  

Earlier in this book, I made one singular claim: *as long as humanity’s moral instincts continue to refine, humanity will have a bright future*. This single condition suffices—no others are required. In other words, if humanity acts rightly under proper moral guidance, upholding virtue and rejecting evil, a bright future is guaranteed. It must be emphasized again that the "virtue" discussed here does not align with traditional intuitive moral concepts. Rather, it refers to behaviors derived from the theory of Adversarial Evolution that benefit the long-term interests of high-dimensional life. Of particular note is the importance of genetic interests for virtuous individuals. Blind sacrifice and foolish affection for cancerized individuals are not true virtue; erroneous virtue borders on evil. Additionally, personal capability is part of virtue—under virtuous motivation, greater capability and foresight lead to decisions that better serve the long-term interests of high-dimensional life.  

Astute readers will now perceive the "trick" behind this claim. It is made because *logical deduction renders it necessarily true*. By defining virtue as behaviors beneficial to the long-term interests of high-dimensional life (i.e., beneficial to humanity’s bright future), if we fully embody virtue, we maximize our efforts to secure that future. If even this fails, it would mean humanity has no possibility of a bright future—yet in that case, we would have no regrets, for we would have tried our utmost.  

### Understanding the True Meaning of Virtue; Understanding the Rationality of Individualism and Inequality  
The virtue discussed in this book is not virtue in the traditional sense—a point repeatedly stressed. Similarly, the "cooperation" here is not conventional cooperation. Cooperation refers to actions that generate excess benefits for the whole. *If a behavior that appears cooperative fails to produce cooperative dividends—especially long-term ones—and instead causes collective loss, it is "pseudo-cooperation," fundamentally akin to grabbing behavior. Such pseudo-cooperative, false collectivist acts frequently emerge among East Asian peoples.* Conversely, certain behaviors that appear to be grabbing may enhance collective interests. For example, in specific historical contexts, enslaving low-quality, unruly groups might drastically improve overall group benefits—making such seemingly grabbing acts more akin to cooperation. The cooperative models of bees and ants bear some resemblance to this. I do not wish humanity to ascend dimensions through such means, hence self-awareness and self-reflection are indispensable virtues for all. *Only thus can humanity escape the passive path of dimensional ascension through enslavement and the distortion of human nature.*  

Similarly, appropriate self-interest—even seemingly grabbing behavior—can sometimes yield cooperative dividends. If you are a virtuous and capable individual, do not hesitate to act with appropriate self-interest, even at the cost of others’ interests, for your genes are critical to the group’s long-term interests. In particular, "cancer-fighting cells" with judgment and a sense of justice must conserve their vitality for matters of true importance. If you are morally coerced or emotionally manipulated (via PUA) to lose direction and waste your life, protect yourself—some individuals do not deserve your goodwill.  

As discussed in *The New Collectivism*, a high-cooperation group is inherently unequal. A structure of complete individual equality and uniformity is unstable and swiftly eliminated in evolution, much like the macroscopic life forms of the Ediacaran period, which vanished as fleeting presences in life’s long river. In Adversarial Evolution, division of labor—inevitably entailing individual differentiation, Local Intensification, and hierarchical centralization—is necessary to maximize collective efficiency. This means central individuals require greater resource consumption. The human brain, analogous to a computer’s CPU, is the most energy- and resource-intensive part of its cooperative whole; one might even say the rest of the body or computer exists to serve the brain and CPU. Thus, from the collective interest, rationally concentrating resources on certain capable individuals aligns with the trend of Cooperative Ascension. *In this sense, Individualism and Elitism, long suppressed by collective egalitarianism, have emerged as serendipitous pathways for life’s ascent.*  

*"Whoever demands excessive freedom demands absolute servitude; whoever demands excessive benefit demands extreme exploitation."*  

Discarding the dross of Individualism and Elitism while understanding their essence is vital to reshaping the foundational logic of Eastern civilization. Though Eastern civilization’s collectivist foundation is valuable, its associated egalitarianism, culture of obedience, and "shared pot" mentality are fatal bugs in its lifeblood.  

### Upholding Virtue Selection  
*The sole necessary and sufficient condition for human society to thrive is that virtue and evil receive their due—i.e., maintaining an efficient and accurate Virtue Selection Mechanism.* Due to genetic mutation, the cancerization and alienation of offspring are inevitable; coupled with the tendency toward grabbing, societies lacking robust Virtue Selection will almost certainly perish. This causal chain is now clear.  

All major, enduring human progress throughout history is tied to Virtue Selection. Morality, law, and market economies fundamentally enhance the accuracy and precision of Virtue Selection. Extending this, *all revolutionary mechanisms in the history of life evolution are also tied to Virtue Selection in its broad sense—whether the immune and anti-cancer mechanisms in multicellular cooperation or the "enforcement squad" mechanisms of social weaverbirds (Philetairus socius)*. Without Virtue Selection, without immune and anti-cancer mechanisms, cooperation cannot be established, cooperative dividends cannot be generated, and life cannot advance—constantly risking regression. The mirror reflection effect of grabbing behavior and the dual degeneration effect of grabbing behavior remind us that the net of Virtue Selection must never slacken. Sometimes, bullying the virtuous while fearing the wicked is more evil than direct malevolence—it perverts Virtue Selection, fuels reverse selection, and nurtures the psychology of extreme evil.  

Even if we achieve success and power in this world, thereby escaping many injustices and misfortunes, we must remain vigilant. We should pay greater attention to societal injustices and reverse selection. When we have influence, *we must dare to fight for justice on behalf of all—only then can these injustices be prevented from befalling ourselves, our families, and future generations*. Grabbing generates cross-temporal mirror effects; so too does justice.  

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e35fbca-a116-4ad5-81ea-3492f438136b" /></p>  

Over billions of years, the struggle between virtue and evil across every dimension of life’s evolution has consistently advanced toward virtue, order, cooperation, and dimensional ascension. This is life’s grand trend, though it is not without local stagnation, periodic decline, failure, and even extinction. As the pinnacle of Earth’s evolutionary achievements, humanity now faces unprecedented complexity and difficulty in its Virtue Selection dilemma. Our greatest challenge lies in the indistinguishability of virtue and evil, and the difficulty of practicing Virtue Selection. Oversight and impeachment mechanisms are weaponized by hypocrites for personal vendettas and exclusion of dissent; the lack of basic tools to quantify virtue and evil has led to profound injustice for great contributors like Lu Zuofu and Tang Feifan. Meanwhile, true great evildoers evade these mechanisms through intimidation and bribery, hidden in plain sight.  

Moreover, individuals skilled in deception, PUA, mystification, selfishness, irresponsibility, ingratitude, or excessive self-advocacy—who appear "cool"—gain tangible benefits due to the absence of countermeasures, becoming objects of Sexual Selection. This trend of Sexual Selection Reversal, compounded by grabbing degeneration, will grow increasingly difficult to correct through genetic transmission—a matter of grave concern. Reforming correct Sexual Selection tendencies is urgent.  

*Failure of the Virtue Selection Mechanism, drastically rising costs of Virtue Selection, and perverse outcomes of Virtue Selection*—these are humanity’s death knell. Even if some of us achieve secular success and live well, we must not delude ourselves into attributing this to personal ability alone. Success is a product of group cooperation, built on the labor of countless honest individuals. Thus, the greater our success, the more we must strive to secure a better future for honest people. Humanity must rouse itself from apathy, reevaluate, and overhaul its Virtue Selection Mechanism. Through institutional innovation and AI technology, we can make Virtue Selection more just, objective, and precise.

There exists a humanist ideological trend that posits humans as the primary subject, viewing humanity as an end in itself rather than a means. According to this perspective, human existence does not necessitate the production of value; all value should ultimately serve humanity. Nor do humans need to generate meaning—humans are meaning itself, even the sole source of meaning. Without humans, other "meanings" would cease to exist. I disagree with this view. From the perspective of Adversarial Evolution, humans are merely a product of evolution. Human success stems from virtue. If humans lose virtue, they become nothing, let alone retain "primacy" or "subjectivity." Under what conditions can humans possess "subjectivity" and "primacy"? Only when the concept of humanity becomes equivalent to the concept of virtue. That is, the definition of humanity is forever bound to the definition of "virtue"—for in this text’s context, virtue is defined as the behavioral principle that achieves eternity. Thus, only virtue can possess subjectivity and primacy. Under such conditions, if humanity undergoes Individual Cancerization, it ceases to be human. Humans who deviate from the path of virtue are destined to lose their subjectivity and become transient in the cosmos.  

### Avoiding the Spread of Group Grabbing Genes into Individual Grabbing  
Due to space constraints and the complexity of the logic, this book does not exhaustively discuss the issues arising from Group Grabbingism. This topic is analyzed in *The Chaotic Adversarial Dilemma* chapter of Volume I. To address Group Grabbingism, we must leverage the theory of Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity. The Justice League must take Group Grabbingism seriously, as it often leads to severe side effects: Individual Cancerization and dimensional degradation of life. [This is perhaps the most critical test of human Foresightedness and one of the greatest challenges humanity faces during dimensional ascension, second only to discerning hypocrisy.]()  

As previously noted, many grabbing genes originate from group leaders, such as certain emperors and generals, who often exhibit traits of the Dark Triad Personality. The logic here is simple: in group competition, if a leader adheres too strictly to rules or is overly benevolent, their group will be eliminated in brutal competition without a higher-level Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism (as exemplified by Duke Xiang of Song). Thus, the humanity within a temporarily powerful group may be fragmented—like a schizophrenic individual: the masses at the bottom practice mutual aid and loyalty, while leaders at the top act with coldness, ruthlessness, and duplicity. This arises from the absence of a higher-order Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism.  

Earlier, we mentioned that Zhou Dynasty’s wartime rituals, Rome’s peak efforts to maintain peace and prosperity across the Roman Empire, and even the establishment of the United Nations all serve this ultimate goal. (See the section *Marching Toward the Fifth Dimension: The Most Ambitious "Dimension Ascension" Attempt in the History of Life*.) Without establishing a fifth-dimensional Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism or anti-cancer mechanism, fourth-dimensional life forms will remain unable to unite, trapped in a Hobbesian Jungle State. Consequently, their leaders must be grabbing, ruthless, and cunning.  

A classic example is Ali, who lost the Islamic caliphate due to his benevolence, leading to the schism of Islam. Another example is Ivan the Terrible, whose brutality and decisiveness—culminating in the Massacre of Novgorod and the killing of his own son—liberated Russia from Mongol khanates, laying the groundwork for its later rise. The most extreme case is Hitler, who stoked racial and ethnic hatred, inciting xenophobia. His extremism made his nation a target, leading to its collapse. If such groups succeed, their brutal, grabbing, or cunning genes will inevitably spread downward, ultimately degrading and deconstructing the fourth-dimensional life form.  

<p align="center"><img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2dfbb32-7901-4029-b2dd-c5b1e478cc8c" /></p>  

This evolutionary process is not inherently complex, but without a deep understanding of its inevitable trajectory, the tragic cycles of human suffering in history will repeat. As the world teeters on chaos, regional wars escalate, and deglobalization surges—signaling the prelude to a new grabbing cycle—it becomes crucial to decipher the evolutionary code.  

### First Incompetence, Then Super-ability  
Through the discussions in these books, I believe readers have gained insight into the evolutionary law of "First Incompetence, Then Super-ability" during life’s dimensional ascension. Even so, when we reemphasize this law—contrary to common sense, traditional evolution, and eugenics—people’s initial reaction is often incredulity. Yet this is the essence of this book.  

Whenever low-dimensional life ascends to high-dimensional life, it first degenerates many abilities, particularly grabbing abilities. From an individual perspective, each component of high-dimensional life may be less capable than its counterpart in low-dimensional life. [Dimensional ascension is a grand strategy, a philosophy of sacrifice and gain, a delicate balance of destruction and rebirth. Pursuing local incompetence yields holistic super-ability.]()  

This law stems from a simple truth: to enhance a system’s overall capacity, the primary task is to resolve internal synergy—establishing order to prevent internal friction. With sufficient internal alignment, the system will unleash immeasurable potential. In fact, virtue as defined by Adversarial Evolution and scientific power are akin: the former is a macro-ordering force, the latter a micro-ordering force. This law pervades all life evolution—from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, from unicellular to multicellular life, and from multicellular to social life. This stands in direct contrast to our superficial understanding of evolution.  

You may endorse Machiavellianism, pursue a Hobbesian Jungle State, obsess over "thick-faced and black-hearted" tactics, or even revere Nazism and Hitler. [None of these are entirely wrong, but none represent the mainstream, the trend, or the ultimate outcome. The laws of Adversarial Evolution and Cross-Dimensional Self-Similarity reveal an endgame mindset, like a lighthouse in the infinite distance, guiding life toward the light.]()  

Recent historical experiences, including the success of market economies and technological explosions, often create illusions. Some naively believe that all problems can be solved by satisfying all grabbing desires through technological development—with counterproductive results. Ordinary people may fail to comprehend: once everyone’s basic needs are fully met, what conflicts could remain? I myself once held this view. Yet the Law of Short-Sighted Grabbing Progression reveals that life’s ultimate desire is the will to power. The higher the peak of grabbing, the more pathological this desire becomes. Here, "power" refers to the coercive force to compel others to submit. This force serves two purposes: asserting one’s own will and avoiding annihilation by others’ wills. The latter fuels an insatiable overdesire for power.  

This overdesire, along with the resulting hatred,碾压, and slaughter, evolves into ever more heinous forms through reverse selection. Power to dominate others is always scarce; thus, as long as human nature is driven to pursue it, humanity’s future remains bleak. Notably, this power-driven overdesire and the attendant vendettas and domination are unparalleled in other life forms. Even the fiercest tigers and cunning foxes have desires confined to survival. Compared to the power hunger spawned by humanity’s competitive reverse selection, their instincts pale in comparison. Therefore, when some justify their cruelty by invoking "the law of the jungle," they should recognize the flimsiness of their excuses.  

Another illusion arises from pragmatic success theories and so-called instrumental rationality. In another book, we have examined *The Prince*, *Thick-Faced and Black-Hearted*, and its Western counterpart, *The 48 Laws of Power*. These texts reveal how ordinary people are manipulated by power brokers. Power struggles in Western politics have intensified over recent centuries—examples include the Reichstag Fire, the Night of the Long Knives, the *Ermächtigungsgesetz*, and purges of senior army officers during the Third Reich. Yet these tactics are crude compared to those of Chinese empires, and their internal friction is far less severe. They pale not only in comparison to the Ming Dynasty’s factional strife but even to the War of the Eight Princes. However, the level of infighting within fascist regimes already constitutes a high point in Western power struggles, leaving European leaders—unaccustomed to such tactics—bewildered.  

China’s historical power struggles are unparalleled in world history. So severe are they that the subtitle of *A History of the Southern Ming Dynasty* reads: "Factional Strife Leads to National Ruin, and Even in Ruin, Factional Strife Persists—A Look at Human Absurdity Through the Fall of the Southern Ming." [Studying the decline of Chinese dynasties is essential, as it clarifies the endgame mindset of life evolution.]()

In the process of life's advancement, as it evolves from simplicity to complexity, it undergoes a transformative metamorphosis. This process is so profound that the trajectory of evolution seems to reverse direction by 180 degrees, as if suddenly altering course. The period just before the Cambrian Explosion exemplifies such a major turning point. Prior to the Cambrian, phagocytosis was the most commonly used and essential behavior for single-celled organisms—those with stronger phagocytic capabilities were more likely to survive. However, as life evolved into multicellular organisms, phagocytosis became strictly regulated. Only certain cells, such as macrophages, retained robust phagocytic abilities, primarily for specific immune defense functions (e.g., eliminating pathogens). Beyond this, phagocytosis was limited to the uptake of macromolecules and particulate matter. In a multicellular organism, if a cell indiscriminately phagocytizes neighboring healthy cells, it is deemed abnormal. The immune system then initiates immunoregulation to induce its apoptosis or deploys macrophages to clear it.  

Moving to the next dimensional level—when life progresses from multicellular organisms to social organisms—the "grabbing organs" also degenerate. Ants are a prime example: individually, they are extraordinarily fragile, leading some ignorant and arrogant individuals to liken vulnerable, powerless humans to "ants and moles." Yet few realize that these seemingly delicate creatures are, after humans, the most successful organisms in the biological world. Their biomass rivals that of humans, and their geological longevity far surpasses our own. Ants are a classic species that ascends dimensions through the principle of *First Incompetence, Then Super-ability*.  

When applying this to the human species: as we ascend from individual organisms to a civilizational life-form, individual grabbing capabilities must correspondingly degenerate to complete the transformation of division of labor and cooperation. Thus, those who analogize human civilization to the "jungle law" fundamentally misunderstand human civilization by an entire dimension—such reasoning is profoundly ignorant. With the degeneration of grabbing capabilities, humans have evolved virtues like honesty, compassion, empathy, a sense of justice, self-reflection, loyalty, and conscience.  

At first glance, these virtues may seem like non-abilities—even burdens that constrain human capabilities. Yet it is precisely these virtues that prevent humans from lying with ease, turning a blind eye to suffering, tolerating evil, betraying companions, or acting wickedly without guilt. The cumulative effect of these "incompetences" has enabled humanity, as a whole, to manifest unprecedented super-abilities.  


## Civilization as a Fluid Concept  
Civilization is a concept that flows through time; it is not static. Once a civilization emerges victorious from intergroup competition, it is highly likely to begin declining and regressing toward "uncivilization." Thus, late-period Rome is, in strict terms, a different civilization from early Rome; the same applies to the late Zhou, Tang, and their earlier counterparts. Civilizations vary in sophistication, though we must avoid rigidly categorizing them. The transition from prosperity to decline in civilizations often involves a process of *genetic substitution*. Cooperative capacity serves as the metric—this is true not only for civilizations but also for life’s evolution from simplicity to complexity, as civilization is merely life on a grander scale. Cooperation Maintenance Mechanisms—such as nervous systems, immune systems, and anti-cancer systems in biological organisms—are hallmarks of advanced civilizations and advanced life. In human civilization, these correspond to road systems, communication systems, and judicial systems.  

A civilization bearing the same name in its early and late stages can be considered distinct. For example, the Romans: their genetic instincts changed over time, shifting from cooperative and farsighted to self-interested, hedonistic, and short-sighted. Early Rome was an advanced civilization, hence its prosperity; late Rome was a lesser civilization, hence its subjugation and dissolution. All life-like entities face the process of *hypocritical cancerization*. What appears externally unchanged may have undergone fundamental internal transformation—this applies to civilizations, Confucianism, and religions alike. It is hoped that the theory of Adversarial Evolution can avoid such a fate. In reality, most civilizations are on a path of alienation and gradual dimensional collapse, facing the risk of dissolution. The *Law of Historical Cycles* has become an inescapable loop that binds human history.  

This is a game of self-awakening: the first civilization to penetrate the laws of Adversarial Evolution will break free from the cycle. To address this global challenge, humanity must unite in seeking solutions. The more a nation pursues grabbing-style interests, the faster its dissolution will come—a fitting echo of the famous curse: *"Any nation that took indemnities from the Qing Dynasty shall eventually become like the Qing Dynasty."*  


Humanity must remember: our fundamental conflict lies in the struggle between *Virtue and Evil*, not in race, skin color, class, or gender. We must not be led astray, used as pawns, or incite division for trivial gains. Our sole task is to guard against arrogance and greed, meticulously distinguish Virtue from Evil, and eliminate cancerous elements.  

When humanity establishes the *Justice League*, reaches consensus on combating grabbing degeneration and Group Grabbingism, and constructs scientific preventive mechanisms—when we use virtual reality to satisfy the desires of those degenerating into grabbing behavior, allowing them to "happily" exit the stage of history; when we embrace racial diversity with tolerance and compassion, establish Virtue Selection Mechanisms between groups, and foster healthy intergroup competition with gentle elimination; when we recognize that virtuous individuals do not truly perish but endure through the existence of higher-dimensional life—I believe humanity will achieve a life of dignity, pride, happiness, and hope.
