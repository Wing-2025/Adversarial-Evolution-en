# Is Human Nature Essentially Virtuous or Evil?——Measuring Virtue and Evil Through Adversarial Evolution  

This is a question that has been debated for two millennia. Countless philosophers have explored this topic, including Eastern thinkers such as Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, Han Feizi, Zhu Xi, and Wang Yangming; and Western figures such as Socrates, Plato, Thucydides, Augustine, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Bentham, Nietzsche, Le Bon, Fromm, and Dawkins, to name but a few. Predecessors argued ceaselessly, while later generations have nearly given up. This is especially true in an era where postmodernism, deconstructionism, and nihilism prevail. The definitions of virtue and evil, their significance, and even the meaning of "meaning" itself seem to have become trivial. On the foundation of nihilism, combined with evolutionary theory and certain modern success-oriented doctrines, moral nihilism has emerged.  

"Scorpions never consider themselves venomous; mosquitoes never think biting others is wrong; flies never find feces filthy and stinking; mice never regard their food as stolen. Humans call mice 'bad' because they steal our grain, but for mice, this is foraging. Humans praise bees as industrious because they make honey for us, but for bees, this is a basic need. So-called 'pests' and 'beneficial insects' are categorized by humans according to their own interests. So-called 'good' and 'bad' are defined by the powerful from their own standpoint. Thus, there are no purely good or evil people; you are evil in his eyes if you harm his interests, and good if you align with them." Such a typical assertion of moral nihilism is difficult to refute.  

Undoubtedly, over the past millennium, human society has undergone transformative changes, rendering many traditional moral theories obsolete. With the rapid development of science and technology, many past values and religious doctrines have faced severe challenges. More critically, morality has been exploited by hypocrites to oppress the virtuous, leading Lu Xun to lament: "I opened a history book and examined it. This history has no dates, and every crooked page is filled with the words 'benevolence and morality.' I could not sleep all night; upon closer inspection, I finally discerned words between the lines—'devouring men' fills the entire text!"  

Thus, one of the missions of this book is to reconstruct morality using the most scientific and cutting-edge theories. Previously, discussions on human nature's virtue or evil were highly subjective. Even a great thinker like Kant could only construct his moral definitions on the basis of three moral formulas paired with metaphysics, revealing the limitations of absolutism. Although Dawkins' era introduced evolutionary theory as a tool, shifting the discussion of human nature from an empirical, subjective era to a scientific, objective one, the incompleteness of evolutionary theory has led this exploration away from the truth, making it increasingly difficult for humans to understand themselves—even leading to self-misconception. This issue has reached a critical point; if unresolved, it will bring profound disasters and indelible traumas to human society. Therefore, this book must repeatedly explore this topic within the theoretical framework of Adversarial Evolution.  

In the previous volume, we discussed the definitions of Virtue and Evil within the Adversarial Evolution framework. When revisiting this issue here, we will contrast these definitions with philosophical schools and public opinions to deepen understanding.  

Regarding the definitions of Virtue and Justice, *The Republic* contains a famous analogy: the "Allegory of the Sun." Socrates compares the sun to the "child" of Virtue. He states: "The human soul is like an eye. When it gazes upon objects illuminated by truth and reality, it can know and understand them—evidently because of reason. But when it turns to dimly lit matters of life, it grows indistinct, with only fluctuating opinions, as if lacking reason." Socrates continues: "You must now acknowledge that the Idea of the Good grants truth to the objects of knowledge and the capacity for knowledge to the knowing subject; it is the cause of knowledge and truth. Truth and knowledge are beautiful, but compared to both, the Idea of the Good is more beautiful." [Plato, through Socrates, uses this analogy to imply that without Virtue, humans cannot understand all things—including truth, knowledge, and beauty. He further posits that Virtue is the cause of truth, knowledge, and beauty.]  

Though Plato's view appears crude and imprecise after two millennia, as we deepen our understanding of Adversarial Evolution and its corollaries, we increasingly recognize the ingenuity of this metaphor. Virtue is the reason humans have not been eliminated in evolution, and all human beauty and prospects are shaped by it.  

Before proceeding, we must align the basic semantics of this text. Henceforth, "Virtue," "Justice," and "morality" will be treated as analogous concepts. Let us revisit the definitions of Virtue and Justice from the previous volume:  

[From a probabilistic perspective, behaviors that benefit the long-term existence of high-dimensional life communities—i.e., benefit the persistence of virtuous genes or their forms. Virtue and Justice represent an ultimately self-consistent life form.]  

In short, virtuous and just behaviors are those that benefit the persistence of virtuous genes, promote life cooperation and self-consistency, reduce internal friction, and lead to evolutionarily stable states.  

## Utilitarianism? Deontologism? The Distinction Between Adversarial Evolutionism and These Schools  

The definition of Virtue within the Adversarial Evolution framework, though simply phrased, is prone to misunderstanding. One commonly accepted view is ["Virtuous and just behaviors are those that benefit the greatest well-being of society."] This is the typical claim of utilitarianism (often translated as "utilitarianism"). [Utilitarianism pursues "the greatest happiness of the greatest number."] Judging the morality of actions by this standard is close to the Adversarial Evolution framework's definition of Virtue. [For behaviors that benefit the greatest happiness of the greatest number often also benefit the long-term existence of high-dimensional life.]  

To draw a cross-dimensional analogy, if a behavior makes a three-dimensional life form, such as a human, feel entirely comfortable, it is likely beneficial to that individual's longevity. [However, the Adversarial Evolution framework's definition of Virtue differs fundamentally from utilitarianism—a difference that, though subtle, leads to significant consequences.]  

For example, does "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" include the "greatest happiness" of "cancerized" or异化 individuals? If so, the greatest happiness of these "cancer cells" might rapidly destroy the life form. Additionally, the above statement implicitly focuses on the current population, excluding the happiness of future generations. This is akin to a three-dimensional life form indulging in present pleasures, prioritizing the immediate gratification of existing cells while disregarding future costs. Would such behaviors—pursuing one generation's happiness at the expense of future generations—still be considered virtuous?  

[Thus, only by tracing back to the persistence of genes can the definitions of Virtue and Justice be precise. They encompass foresightedness and self-consistency; to achieve these, Virtue and Justice even include a degree of exclusivity—excluding short-sighted, anti-cooperative, and anti-connective anti-life factors. The behavior of "hating evil as much as one loves virtue" is a concrete manifestation of this exclusivity.]  

[The Virtue of Adversarial Evolution approximates utilitarianism but adds a large temporal constraint: benefiting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of lives over a large time span.]  

Let us now examine deontologism, represented by Kant's deontology, utilitarianism's traditional rival. Superficially, deontology emphasizes process over outcome, asserting that the morality of an action depends on whether it adheres to universal moral duties, regardless of consequences. These duties include honesty, gratitude, benevolence, and justice, guided by Kant's three moral formulas: the Formula of Universal Law, the Formula of Humanity, and the Formula of Autonomy.  

However, deontologism (deontology) has critical flaws: its moral judgments are overly rigid and dogmatic. Like the Chinese legal system mentioned earlier, which adheres to "no crime without law," deontology struggles to define morality for acts not explicitly supported or prohibited by moral rules. More critically, when moral duties conflict, deontology rarely provides convincing conclusions. Consider the classic thought experiment: a robber chases an innocent person, who flees to your home. When the robber asks if the person is there, should you uphold honesty? Deontology answers yes. If we revise deontology to prioritize benevolence over honesty, this problem seems resolved. Let us consider another example: your friend embezzles public funds, causing significant harm to local economic development. When the inspection agency asks you to testify, should you report your friend? If benevolence overrides honesty, should you protect your friend?  

Thus, deontology's flaws reflect that unquantified morality is inherently imprecise. Yet how do we establish measurement standards? Returning to Adversarial Evolutionism, these issues are straightforward from the perspective of high-dimensional life's long-term interests: if the robber succeeds, they gain benefit, which is detrimental to society's long-term development; thus, the innocent must be protected. Your friend's embezzlement harms local development; thus, you should report truthfully. Of course, utilitarianism can also explain these issues perfectly. Does this mean deontologism is inferior to utilitarianism?

Let us now conduct a series of thought experiments to explore the essential issues of Utilitarianism.  

### Why Might Maximizing the Greatest Happiness for the Greatest Number Still Be Immoral?  
We recognize that female fidelity is an important virtuous duty. However, from a Utilitarian perspective, female promiscuity might actually yield greater utility: red-light districts generate substantial tax revenue; transactions between prostitutes and clients are consensual, adhering to the principle of voluntarism; and prostitution maximizes the well-being of both parties without harming third parties. Prohibiting prostitution could even be seen as a severe infringement on personal freedom. Common objections—such as the objectification of women, gender discrimination, or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases—are often deemed unconvincing, as proper precautions and regulation could mitigate these issues. People thus wonder: whom does female promiscuity offend? Whom does it harm? Why is it met with such severe moral condemnation? Why cannot Utilitarianism explain this phenomenon, while Deontology, though correct in its judgment, fails to clarify the underlying reasons?  

This question becomes clearer when framed within the framework of Adversarial Evolution. Women can exchange sexual access for survival resources, a logic rooted in the exchange of reproductive resources for survival resources—a common behavior in the biological world. However, female promiscuity amounts to acquiring survival resources from multiple men without providing reproductive resources in return. This occurs frequently in real society: as discussed in the previous volume, the female tycoon Li Wei, who amassed billions, built a network of connections with multiple provincial and ministerial officials through such means. Many women in society also use sexual attraction to flirt and simultaneously exploit financial and social resources from multiple men. Furthermore, promiscuous species often trigger gender wars between males and females, a topic elaborated in the previous volume and thus not revisited here.  

So, what does female promiscuity harm? While it provides short-term well-being to men, it undermines their genetic interests in the long term. From the perspective of the entire group, it damages the genetic interests of higher-dimensional life. If we define "virtue" as actions beneficial to the long-term interests of higher-dimensional life and "evil" as the opposite, then female promiscuity is indeed evil. The human moral revulsion against promiscuity, in turn, stems from the natural selection and survival of the fittest among higher-dimensional life.  

Let us construct a similar thought experiment. Suppose Girl A, while in a relationship with boyfriend B, has an affair with another boy C, becomes pregnant, and deceives B into believing the child is his. They marry quickly, lead a happy life, raise healthy and filial children, and the couple eventually enjoys a peaceful old age—until B discovers in his later years that the child is not his biological offspring. Should B be angry and seek accountability? From a Utilitarian view, this seems a mutually beneficial outcome: A and B enjoy a happy marriage, their children provide for them in old age, and C gains physical pleasure without responsibility, achieving "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." What is there to regret? Yet in reality, most people in such a situation would feel profound, even unbearable anger. Moreover, not only the aggrieved party but all individuals with moral instincts would strongly condemn A and C. Where does this discrepancy arise? B, the cuckolded partner, has suffered no material harm beyond raising a non-biological child. Had he never discovered the truth, he might have lived out his days in contentment. Is his anger merely because A and C violated some abstract deontological principle?  

From the lens of Adversarial Evolution, the essence becomes clear. A and C’s actions harm B’s genetic interests—specifically, his fundamental reproductive interests. A shrewd reader might object: for the group as a whole, this is merely a transfer of genetic interests (from B to C). From the perspective of higher-dimensional life, total population and overall happiness remain unchanged. If this action does not damage the long-term interests of higher-dimensional life, why should it be morally condemned? To resolve this, we must further apply the tools of Adversarial Evolution.  

Consider the relative value of B and C to the group. B is a responsible, hardworking man who provides for his family and ensures their happiness. C, by contrast, is an irresponsible, deceitful "playboy" who preys on women, likely idle and overambitious. Statistically, B’s offspring would contribute far more to higher-dimensional life than C’s. In other words, if B-type genes are systematically replaced by C-type "playboy" genes, higher-dimensional life would face a crisis of rampant irresponsibility and deception.  

Delving deeper into Adversarial Evolution, the consequences are even more profound—potentially reversing Sexual Selection Reversal. If promiscuity faces no moral condemnation or punishment, promiscuous women would gain greater economic and survival advantages than chaste women. When these advantages become significant, men who prefer promiscuous women would indirectly benefit, particularly through the reproductive success of their female offspring. Over time, such men would be selected for. Yet female promiscuity directly harms men, creating a paradoxical genetic imperative: men are drawn to promiscuous women but demand fidelity from them.  

Freud astutely observed this contradiction: "The more frivolous and unchaste a woman is, the more irresistibly she attracts a man. Love for such a woman fills him with rapture and obsession, yet once smitten, he demands her fidelity." This dynamic is even more common in reverse: "Women don’t love good men—they love bad ones." In a corrupt environment, women unconsciously exhibit similar reversals in mate selection. Freud’s observation could easily be gender-swapped: "The more of a ‘bad boy’ a man is, the more wildly a woman loves him. Love for such a man leaves her infatuated and enraptured, yet once in love, she demands his fidelity." Some women openly admit they feel no attraction to earnest, unassuming men, even claiming, "Women want to be seduced, not simply treated well."  

In many cases, women, aware they are being deceived by a playboy, abandon their reason, endure humiliation, and persist in self-destructive relationships. This phenomenon arises because playboys face no consequences. Even if women with "playboy-preference" genes suffer in life, their offspring inherit the playboy genes and thus gain genetic advantages. In this way, genes for "loving abusive playboys" spread alongside playboy genes.  

At its core, humanity’s "greatest happiness" is the continuation of genes; the pursuit of happiness is merely the earthly projection of selfish genes. When selfish genes prioritize stupidity and short-sightedness, this projection manifests as individual selfishness and immorality; when they favor intelligence and foresight, it manifests as justice and morality. "Gold-diggers" and playboys, though their consensual interactions seem to leave individual happiness intact, remain immoral and deserving of punishment—here, Deontology proves more accurate than Utilitarianism.  

### Apparent Similarity, Divergent Evolutionary Value, and Opposite Moral Nature  
Let us alter the previous scenario slightly to further test this moral logic (the following narrative is entirely fictional and exaggerated for theoretical illustration). Suppose A, B, and C are close friends living in similar houses nearby. One night, C, disoriented by darkness and medication, mistakenly enters B’s room and has intercourse with A, who is drowsy from sleeping pills. C, remorseful upon waking, intends to make amends but must depart immediately to join combat as a People’s Liberation Army soldier, later dying heroically in battle. A, unaware of the mistake, believes she slept with her husband B. Later, A and B have other children.  

Due to C’s heroic deeds, which advanced national liberation, he is widely revered. His peers, including A and B, lament that he died without leaving offspring. One day, A and B notice their son’s resemblance to C, and through DNA testing and investigation, discover the child is C’s biological son. B, realizing he has raised the son of the national hero C—preventing C’s lineage from dying with his sacrifice—feels not anger but profound pride and responsibility. The community eagerly supports raising the child, with no stigma attached.  

This story, though structurally identical to the previous one (B is cuckolded and raises another’s child), yields a diametrically opposite moral response. Neither Utilitarianism nor Deontology can explain this discrepancy.

We can also analyze from the perspective of Adversarial Evolution and higher-dimensional life forms. The only difference between the two stories lies in the Virtue and Evil of Genes A and C. If they embody Evil, increasing the number of Evil descendants and decreasing Virtuous ones, this becomes a sorrowful and infuriating tale; if they embody supreme Virtue, increasing supremely Virtuous descendants, it becomes a joyful and happy story. [For the former results in long-term losses for higher-dimensional life forms, while the latter brings long-term gains. The logic here is actually quite straightforward.]  

We can also understand this example through another school of ethics—Virtue Ethics. Why does Virtue Ethics focus so intently on moral character (i.e., moral motivation) rather than outcomes? The fundamental reason is that Virtue has profound long-term implications for higher-dimensional life forms, far more significant than short-term results. To draw an analogy: would you choose to lose a hand or develop a fatal cancer through mutation? The former severely impairs your quality of life, while the latter dooms you to death within a decade. Any rational life form would prefer temporary hardship over future demise. [All these ethical theories and moral intuitions ultimately point, implicitly, to a single ultimate criterion—the long-term interests of higher-dimensional life forms.]  

In fact, deontology does not entirely disregard outcomes; it focuses on outcomes over a longer timeframe and larger spatial scale (as evident in Kant’s essay defending against the robber dilemma). If honesty, gratitude, kindness, and justice generally reduced overall human well-being and happiness, no one would list them as moral obligations. On the contrary, these virtues may temporarily diminish certain individuals’ happiness but, in the long term—especially from the perspective of the higher-dimensional life form as a whole—they promote its maximal long-term well-being and immortality. This is the cornerstone of higher-dimensional life’s survival and the foundational order for Cooperative Ascension. [Thus, deontological philosophical trends pursue long-term outcomes—outcomes in probabilistic terms.] This aligns closely with the definition of Virtue within the Adversarial Evolution framework. [Upon careful reflection, all past ethical schools that hold at least partial validity—intuitive morality, utilitarianism, deontology (duty ethics), and Virtue Ethics—will converge under the foundation of Adversarial Evolutionism.]  

### Why Selfishness Can Sometimes Be Moral and Virtuous  
Using the tools of Adversarial Evolution, we can conduct highly quantified assessments of Virtue and Evil. By extending the utilitarian scale to focus on the interests of the higher-dimensional life form’s collective genes rather than happiness itself, we unify utilitarianism and deontology under the Adversarial Evolution framework. [This also corrects deontology’s tendency toward blind dogmatism. We will find that all moral issues are demonstrable and quantifiable, rather than self-evident.]  

We can construct a simple thought experiment. Honesty is a key moral obligation, yet when an invader asks about the hiding place of PLA soldiers, we do not condemn lying as unethical. Instead, we strongly condemn betraying comrades through “excessive honesty.” This is difficult to explain within deontological frameworks that claim to pursue procedural justice regardless of outcomes, requiring prioritization and special conditions for different duties. In the Adversarial Evolution framework, however, it is straightforward: honesty toward enemies severely harms the interests of higher-dimensional life forms.  

We can explore a more complex thought experiment: the [Rational Selfishness Experiment]. At first glance, both utilitarianism and Adversarial Evolutionism focus on the collective interests of the higher-dimensional life form. [Does this mean individual interests should always be subordinated to the collective?]  

Consider an altered Trolley Problem. A runaway trolley with failed brakes faces two options: hit five strangers on the track, or pull a lever to divert it off a cliff, sacrificing yourself to save the five. For utilitarianism, sacrificing one life to save five achieves the “greatest happiness for the greatest number” (setting aside debates over higher vs. lower happiness). For Adversarial Evolutionism, deeper probabilistic analysis is needed—assessing the long-term value of yourself and the five individuals to the human species (the higher-dimensional life form).  

If the five are virtuous scientists and you are a replaceable trolley driver, sacrificing yourself to save them is widely celebrated as heroic, aligning with the higher-dimensional life form’s long-term interests. If the five are reckless vagabonds trespassing on the tracks, the driver’s genetic value—with their capacity for sacrifice—is likely more beneficial to the higher-dimensional life form. Thus, refusing to sacrifice oneself is justifiable.  

The most challenging scenario is when the driver knows nothing about the five. Here, societal moral averages matter. In a close-knit, morally upright community where everyone knows each other as virtuous, sacrificing oneself for the five is morally supported. In a morally deficient, anonymous society where the driver’s rare virtuous genes are valuable, sacrificing oneself for uncertain genetic quality would likely harm the higher-dimensional life form’s long-term interests. The driver should rationally preserve their virtuous genes for more opportune moments. This example unifies egoism and altruism and distinguishes the higher-dimensional life form’s long-term interests from traditional collectivism.  

### Distinguishing Minor Virtue from Major Virtue—A Non-Rigorous Reappraisal of the Xuanwu Gate Incident  
We apply this theory to analyze the Xuanwu Gate Incident. Li Shimin premeditatedly killed his two brothers and detained his father to seize the throne. Such fratricide and regicide violated traditional ethical norms but held rationality and necessity within the imperial family governing a nation.  

First, Li Shimin’s achievements and capabilities far surpassed his brothers, including the Crown Prince. If he had not acted, his capable subordinates would likely have rebelled or fled (as seen repeatedly in history, from the Sixteen Kingdoms to the Five Dynasties). Aware of this pattern, Li Shimin knew that yielding would only delay the inevitable conflict, which would harm the Tang Dynasty more severely. Choosing short-term pain over long-term suffering, he prioritized greater moral imperatives over minor virtues. Eventually, his strict self-discipline and the Tang Dynasty’s golden age vindicated his intent.  

Li Shimin’s coup, driven by a desire to protect his own genetic lineage, the virtuous ministers of early Tang, and the creation of a prosperous era, was both unavoidable and necessary, aligning with the great path of Cooperative Ascension. A hero would not have hesitated due to minor virtues if capable of creating a golden age. [Abandoning minor virtues for major righteousness is itself a great Virtue; clinging to minor virtues while sacrificing major righteousness is a great Evil. Great Virtue often coexists with minor Evil; supremely great Virtue may even coexist with what ordinary values deem great Evil.]  

Centuries later, Yongzheng handled similar dilemmas less admirably, but few princes possess sufficient self-awareness—over time, such issues arise inherently from the imperial system and cognitive limitations. Li Yuan, failing to study history, recognize the situation, or act decisively to pass the throne to Li Shimin, was driven by personal interests, clinging to the嫡长制 (primogeniture) to justify his reluctance to cede power to a son whose influence threatened his authority. A dynasty’s strength depends not only on its emperor but also on its ministers. Li Shimin represented a team, just as Liu Bang’s victory over Xiang Yu stemmed from his superior team. Competent ministers stabilize a dynasty even with an average emperor—Wuzetian, for example, benefited from the political order of preceding reigns, avoiding collapse despite her use of sycophants and consorts.  

Caesar shares parallels with Li Shimin in his moral ambiguities, though his legacy remains less clear-cut, as he lacked the chance to prove himself. His choice of an heir (not his biological son) placed his offspring at a disadvantage, yet this heir founded a dynasty even longer-lasting than the Tang, indirectly vindicating Caesar’s intent.  

To reiterate, this book aims to guide thinking, not to deduce historical facts. Our historical inferences may be inaccurate, but similar patterns recur throughout history.  

### Adversarial Evolutionary Historiography Is Not Simply Outcome-Oriented

### Evaluating the Good and Bad of Historical Events or Figures: A Multilayered Perspective  

Assessing the merits or demerits of a historical event or figure involves several layers of analysis.  

**The First Layer: Personal Preference and Standpoint**  
The first layer evaluates based on personal preferences and one’s own standpoint. For instance, men may judge from a male perspective; women may empathize with the hardships of their gender; commoners may resent nobles and rulers; and the aristocracy may disdain unruly commoners.  

**The Second Layer: Short-Term Interests of the General Public (Utilitarianism in Historiography)**  
The second layer evaluates from the perspective of the short-term interests of all people, with outcomes as the guiding principle. This is the conventional approach in contemporary historiography, akin to utilitarianism in historical analysis.  

**The Third Layer: Adversarial Evolution and the Human Superorganism**  
The third layer examines events or figures from the vantage point of Adversarial Evolution, analyzing their impact on the overall human life community—or what we term the "superorganism." While the flaws of the first layer are obvious, the second layer still has significant limitations. Consider examples: Nero’s tyranny was followed by the golden age of the Five Good Emperors; Wu Zetian’s promotion of consort clans and favored officials led to chaos, yet Tang China later flourished under the Kaiyuan era; Emperor Chongzhen, though diligent, became a doomed ruler, a victim of a crumbling dynasty marked by treacherous ministers, partisan strife, and eroded trust between ruler and court.  

The human life community is a "superorganism" spanning tens of thousands of miles and millennia. Evaluating its interests requires extending the impact of events far into the future—an endeavor that seems impossible. Yet this is where the power of Adversarial Evolution lies: though perfect prediction is beyond us, we can infinitely improve the accuracy of our forecasts by deepening our experience and logical rigor. Intriguingly, the results of such analysis often align closely with our intuitive moral sense, a beauty that returns to simplicity. The reason is straightforward: we ourselves are products of group selection, and group selection favors groups with foresighted individuals.  

### Case Study: Liu Bang, Founder of the Han Dynasty  
History abounds with figures and events that defy easy judgment—Liu Bang, the Han founder, is one such example. He overthrew the Qin’s tyranny, unified China, and established the Han Dynasty, which brought centuries of relative stability. Yet he was also hypocritical, deceptive, scheming, and ungrateful, betraying and eliminating his meritorious generals.  

To assess his long-term impact, we focus on two dimensions: biological genes and cultural genes.  

- **Biological Genes**: Liu Bang’s hypocrisy, performative behavior, and penchant for political maneuvering were disseminated through his imperial descendants, increasing the proportion of hypocrisy genes in the population.  
- **Cultural Genes**: His impact was even more pernicious. He initially feigned humility, made grand promises (including inscribed oaths like, "Even if the Yellow River shrinks to a sash and Mount Tai crumbles to a whetstone, your fief shall endure, and its blessings shall extend to your descendants"—a tactic reminiscent of sweet-talk to win a girl’s favor, much like his boasts when first meeting his father-in-law and Lü Zhi). Yet within years, he led armies to massacre his former allies. This duplicity profoundly shaped China’s cultural genes. As Liu Yuxi wrote in *Temple of Han Xin*:  
  > A peerless strategist, Han Xin met his end in a bell chamber, lamenting the fates of loyal generals.  
  > Henceforth, later generations ascending to command hesitated—should they seek merit, fearing it might overshadow their ruler?  

This culture of political maneuvering deeply influenced subsequent dynasties and persists in modern officialdom, workplaces, and corporate culture.  

As for Liu Bang’s achievements: while he overthrew Qin and unified China, Qin’s collapse was inevitable even without him. His contributions paled beside Chen Sheng and Wu Guang (who ignited the rebellion), Han Xin (who conquered vast territories), and Xiang Yu (who crushed Qin’s main forces). Moreover, the merits of centralized prefecture-county governance remain debatable—a topic explored in later chapters. Enfeoffment, which maintained moderate competition between groups, had its virtues: the Hundred Schools of Thought, Europe’s scientific revolution, and the Age of Discovery all flourished under such competitive environments. Xiang Yu’s attempt to re-enfeoff the realm, though deemed unprogressive, had both tradition and reason on its side.  

The Zhou-Qin Transformation, which shifted from enfeoffment to centralization, brought short-term efficiency but also sowed seeds of political intrigue, deception, and Legalist ruthlessness. These cultural genes ultimately trapped China in the Law of Historical Cycles for two millennia.  

(Note: This analysis is cursory, and my grasp of historical facts is limited. For example, eliminating功臣 generals also stabilized rule—Zhang Liang, who retired, and Wu Rui, a genuinely virtuous figure, did find peace (largely because their fiefs were small; Zhang Liang’s was insignificant, and Wu Rui’s lands were mostly under Zhao Tuo). Many later figures were far more destructive. This is merely a preliminary demonstration of Adversarial Evolution’s analytical framework.)  

### The "Wisest" Fools: Instincts of Virtue/Evil and Intelligence  
Instincts of virtue and evil are independent of intelligence. High intelligence paired with evil instincts often breeds extreme hypocrisy, multiplying destructive power. Today, a moral nihilism pervades society, summarized in a "compelling" narrative:  

> Let us observe small phenomena: Scorpions sting without awareness of their venom; mosquitoes bite without remorse; flies swarm filth without revulsion; rats scurry through alleys without guilt over "theft." Humans, however, judge by their own standards—labeling rats "villains" while praising bees’ diligence. Yet to rats, grain is survival, not "theft."  
> What is virtue? What is evil? If you are an ally, you are a saint; if you threaten interests, you are a demon. "Pests" and "beneficial insects" are human constructs. When we call COVID-19 a "virus," does Earth see humans as the true virus—exploiting and destroying, prompting her "immune system" (COVID-19) to retaliate?  
> There is no absolute good or bad—only survival. Right and wrong are masks for self-interest. Nothing is inherently rational or absurd: acts aligning with majority views are "rational"; those transcending them are "absurd." In a world of crows, even a white swan is guilty.  
> Human society is a grand stage of lies and deception, all cloaked in respectability. The essence of the world? Consider Zhuge Liang’s Empty Fort Strategy, revealing three tiers of human wisdom:  
> 1. Zhuge, knowing the fort was empty, remained calm.  
> 2. Sima Yi, knowing it was a ruse, chose to retreat.  
> 3. Zhuge, aware Sima knew, still held his ground.  
> This is not just a battle of wits but mutual understanding.  
> Action has three tiers:  
> 1. We see the lie.  
> 2. They know we see the lie.  
> 3. Both know, yet maintain a默契 (tacit balance).  
> Lying itself is trivial—it is a facade. True wisdom lies in seeing through it to the truth.  

This narrative reflects real social dynamics, as discussed in texts like *Ju Guan Lun* over a millennium ago. It pervades modern relationships: between genders, superiors and subordinates, officials and merchants, and companies. Yet this "wisdom" has doomed countless dynasties and civilizations. Is it not akin to "rational fools" who skip queues—initially convenient, but leading to chaos when all trample one another? After millennia of suffering in the historical cycle, how can such "wisdom" persist in the 21st century?  

Precisely because human society resembles a growing scam, with flames licking at us, we must strive to extinguish them—not worship the fire.

Furthermore, the claim that the animal kingdom operates solely on self-interest without moral standards is also incorrect. Within the theoretical framework of Adversarial Evolution, there *are* standards—it is not a realm without criteria. If humanity, as the species with the highest degree of cooperation on Earth, fails to work toward preserving cooperation among Earth's species, maintaining ecological balance, and through Dimension Ascension, developing emergent capacities to mitigate potential future risks—whether from nature, the cosmos, or other sources—that could threaten life-sustaining planets, then humanity becomes detrimental. In simpler terms, if humanity cannot contribute to the long-term preservation of life forms, it is harmful. Conversely, if humanity is beneficial, it is also advantageous to locally cull certain species that harm humanity or limit their capacity to threaten it. The prerequisite is that humanity, the species with the greatest subjective agency and high-dimensional capacities, acts with correct, virtuous, and just motivations; in such cases, the life of the entire planet should make necessary sacrifices for humanity.  

### Convergence of Paths—The Platonic Form of Virtue  
[Moral instincts and moral intuitions are the result of long-term natural selection and group selection among high-dimensional groups, often reflecting the long-term outcomes of Adversarial Evolution. Utilitarianism aligns with short-term Adversarial Evolution; deontologism often embodies long-term Adversarial Evolution. Egoism and elitism frequently align with conclusions from local, low-dimensional Adversarial Evolution but contradict those from high-dimensional Adversarial Evolution; altruism and collectivism often align with mid- to short-term Adversarial Evolution but lack true foresightedness.]()  
[Thus, utilitarianism and deontologism; egoism and altruism; elitism and collectivism—all find a degree of unity within the framework of Adversarial Evolution.]()  
Many pose questions like, "Is there no such thing as justice, only raw self-interest?" The answer is that justice and self-interest do not conflict. [For high-dimensional life, and for selfish genes, justice *is* the interest of high-dimensional life, and the interest of high-dimensional life *is* justice.]() From this perspective, it becomes easier to understand the moral essence of actions by figures like Li Shimin, Yongzheng, and Caesar—kings with certain moral flaws. Truly great life forms transcend labels of self-interest or selflessness, morality or immorality, honesty or dishonesty, compassion or indifference. Their ultimate value lies in ensuring the long-term survival of their kin’s genes. Traits like honesty, gratitude, compassion, justice, and sacrifice are all individual instincts that serve this ultimate genetic purpose. To deepen our understanding, let us excerpt a passage from the first volume on virtue:  

[Virtue is the "wise" choice of selfish genes; it embodies the genes’ "foresightedness" for long-term survival. Virtue *is* foresightedness. Virtuous actions increase the likelihood of a gene’s long-term survival. Within the Adversarial Evolution theoretical system, "foresightedness" is a particularly prominent and critical attribute of virtue. Before the theory of Adversarial Evolution, such "foresighted" judgments were often not derived through rational deduction but inscribed in humanity’s moral instincts.]()  

Through the precise reasoning of Adversarial Evolution, we arrive at judgments that are the most universal, intuitive, and deeply inscribed in our genes. When one fully comprehends the totality of an event, adopts an absolutely neutral stance, and discards cultural and theoretical biases, the moral intuitions of most people align with the conclusions of Adversarial Evolution. This is the simplicity of the Great Dao, the convergence of diverse paths.  

Here, we may seem to elevate Adversarial Evolution to near-divine status. Does this mean that understanding Adversarial Evolution solves all problems, allowing us to arrogantly claim that all our actions are virtuous? According to the definitions of Adversarial Evolution and virtue, in theory, we could. However, it is deeply regrettable that accurately predicting the outcomes of Adversarial Evolution requires simulating all operational details of our entire universe. Even if we exhausted all Earth’s resources and employed the most advanced technology, this remains impossible. Thus, the arrogance of believing Adversarial Evolution can solve all problems is equivalent to claiming mastery over all known and unknown mathematical and physical problems, along with the computational power to simulate the entire world. [Therefore, the Platonic form of virtue exists but remains unknowable.]()  

<div align="center">  
|  | Definition of Virtue | Foresightedness & Precision | Characteristics |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Moral Instinct, Moral Intuition (Moral Instinct) | Phased outcomes of Adversarial Evolution, reflected in human instincts | Some far-sighted, some near-sighted | Limited malleability; probabilistically the most concise and effective approximation of the Platonic form, but becomes outdated amid environmental changes |  
| Utilitarianism | The greatest happiness for the greatest number | Near-sighted but precise | Measurable, quantifiable |  
| Deontologism | Defined through formulas of universal law, humanity, and autonomy | Far-sighted but imprecise | Rational induction of moral laws; good foresightedness, but lacks quantification and can be overly absolute |  
| Virtue Ethics | Focuses on moral motivation, asserting that virtuous actions arise from virtuous motives | Far-sighted but imprecise | Probabilistically more likely to yield long-term optimal results, but also lacks quantification; outcomes may be poor |  
| Application of Adversarial Evolutionism | Limited deduction from Adversarial Evolution theory | Far-sighted and relatively precise | Combines measurability and foresightedness; requires constant self-correction and refinement |  
| Platonic Form of Adversarial Evolutionism | Infinite deduction from Adversarial Evolution theory; the Platonic form of virtue | Infinitely far-sighted | Unknowable, but infinitely approachable; it is humanity’s enduring direction of effort |  
</div>  

This does not render the theory useless. [Our universe operates under certain macro-rules consistent across all dimensions of life evolution, transcending most physical laws. These include the Law of Cooperative Dividend, the Law of Division-of-Labor Dividend, the Law of Grabbing Deficit, the Principle of Resource Centralization, the Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism, the Hypocrisy Cancerization Mechanism, the Hierarchical Adversarial Evolution Model, and the Dimension Ascension Phenomenon.]() Equipped with these tools, we can progressively approach the Platonic form of virtue. Mastery of these cross-dimensional laws allows us to navigate toward the ultimate destination with far greater clarity than before. Moreover, Adversarial Evolution theory can nearly deduce the ultimate state of life evolution—the ultimate virtue: Dimension Ascension. Like a towering lighthouse in a foggy sea, it prevents us from losing our way amid life’s meandering paths. It unites life forms of differing origins, paths, beliefs, and structures—ultimately converging toward harmony.  

## The Shaping of Human Nature  

As we revisit the weighty billions of years of Earth’s life evolution, we can clearly reconstruct the evolutionary process of human nature—the process by which nature has shaped it. The transition from one-dimensional prokaryotic life to two-dimensional eukaryotic life via endosymbiotic cooperation was largely complete over a billion years ago, exerting only indirect influence on the nature of humanity, a four-dimensional species. We will focus instead on the dimensional ascension from two-dimensional single-celled life to three-dimensional multicellular life, and from there to four-dimensional social life, examining how human nature evolved through these phases.  

### The Shaping of Two-Dimensional Virtue  

We know that the ascension of two-dimensional life to three-dimensional life independently evolved over forty times across different evolutionary branches. Three-dimensional animals experimented tentatively during the Ediacaran Period, but true species diversification of three-dimensional multicellular animals occurred only in the Cambrian. Initially, cooperation among the two-dimensional single-celled organisms within three-dimensional multicellular life remained crude, with overall group cooperation still low. How, then, did cooperation deepen to further leverage the Cooperative Dividend? Nature deployed its tried-and-true evolutionary program: survival competition. It pitted these cooperative groups of two-dimensional single-celled organisms—sharing the same genetic lineage, such as jellyfish, trilobites, Hallucigenia, Opabinia, and Anomalocaris—against one another, driving natural selection. These single-celled groups competed both inter- and intra-specifically; the most cooperative groups—e.g., a particular trilobite—survived, reflecting the high cooperation of the cells composing it. Through repeated cycles of selection, the cooperation of these two-dimensional single-celled groups escalated.  

These two-dimensional single-celled organisms first degenerated the "grabbing organs" they had developed in the two-dimensional era. To maximize the Cooperative Dividend and gain greater survival advantages, they embarked on a lengthy evolutionary journey of functional differentiation. Thus, these single-celled organisms diversified into specialized roles, forming various functional systems: digestive systems, mouthparts, appendages, nerve ganglia, notochords, chelicerae, and other "eighteen skills." Superficially, each three-dimensional multicellular organism appeared to act alone, but the true test lay in the cooperation and maintenance mechanisms of the two-dimensional single-celled groups composing them. Over time, the complexity of cooperation among these two-dimensional organisms grew, giving rise to nervous systems, circulatory systems, interstitial fluid systems, and brain systems. With these systems, these two-dimensional groups achieved unprecedented levels of cooperation—commands from the brain were executed methodically—and they triumphed in three-dimensional life competition. Across time, three-dimensional self-consciousness emerged. They were no longer merely two-dimensional groups.  

<p align="center">  
<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e880206-9c38-4c7b-9943-bb5328a25f27" />  
</p>

Beyond the aforementioned explicit systems, what is more critical is that, to manage such a vast population of two-dimensional unicellular life forms and prevent the emergence of Grabbingists and traitors among them, Cooperation Maintenance Systems have evolved—such as the Immune System, Anti-Cancer System, Telomere Limitation Mechanism, Germ Cell Retention Mechanism, and Imprinting Gene Mechanism. These systems are all designed to ensure that the numerous two-dimensional unicellular life forms cooperate closely rather than engage in mutual Grabbingism or internal depletion. [Thus, at the dawn of three-dimensional multicellular life, natural selection favored the genes of two-dimensional unicellular life with strong cooperative instincts from the previous dimension. This marks the formation process of "Virtue of Two Dimensions."]  

### The Shaping Process of "Evil of Three Dimensions"  
We know that for individuals, Grabbingism secures genetic advantages more swiftly than cooperation. Therefore, alongside the cultivation of "Virtue of Two Dimensions," three-dimensional life, driven by survival imperatives, began to adopt Grabbingism against other three-dimensional multicellular life forms to propagate their genes. The law of "Survival of the Fittest" gradually became the dominant theme in the evolution of these nascent three-dimensional life forms. Brutality, ferocity, belligerence, self-serving behavior, and distrust of all but oneself defined the survival philosophy of three-dimensional life during this period. Earth’s successive dominant species—such as anomalocarids, eurypterids, orthocones, Dunkleosteus, megalodon, Meganeura, Arthropleura, and later dinosaurs (where two-dimensional cooperation reached its zenith)—exemplify these traits.  

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc2648a-e2c5-44d4-a062-fb066aceb3a7" />
</p>  

These Grabbingist species quickly eradicated the defenseless macroscopic animals of the Ediacaran Period, which adhered solely to "Self-Cultivationism." They have since become the protagonists of Earth’s biological evolution over the past hundreds of millions of years. [Thus, the human instinct for evil began to take root at this stage, becoming one of humanity’s ancient, foundational instincts. It co-evolved with the two-dimensional instinct for virtue; under natural selection, both the cooperative capacity of two-dimensional life and the Grabbingist tendency of three-dimensional life advanced in tandem.]  

Notably, not all three-dimensional instincts equate to evil. Evil arises only when three-dimensional instincts, unchecked, harm the long-term interests of the collective. Appetites for food, material goods, sex, and survival are, in most cases, necessary for life—they are both three-dimensional instincts and aligned with the long-term interests of higher-dimensional life, thus constituting basic virtues. However, unrestrained indulgence in these instincts leads, internally, to intensified intra-species conflict (e.g., sexual warfare, brood parasitism), ultimately reducing the species’ broad sense fitness; externally, boundless Grabbingism disrupts food chains, degrades the environment, and ultimately harms the species itself. As seen with apex predators practicing Grabbingism, such species are fated for extinction. In a sense, evil may be a necessary transitional state for virtue, a pattern evident across all dimensional evolutionary histories, though we will not elaborate further here. What is certain is that any species that无止境地 pursues Grabbingism will perish, as all species it preys upon will vanish; similarly, a species that indulges in unchecked intra-species Grabbingism will also meet extinction. Fortunately, humans are not such a species.  

### The Shaping Process of "Virtue of Three Dimensions"  
This process closely mirrors the formation of "Virtue of Two Dimensions": the evolution of three-dimensional life toward four-dimensional ascension. Over eons, cooperation among two-dimensional unicellular life grew so intimate that they became inseparable, forging tight [spatial-temporal linkages and ascending to true three-dimensional life]. By the Cambrian Period, three-dimensional life had reached its apex. As three-dimensional life entered a new phase, the earliest stirrings of four-dimensional instincts emerged between the sexes. Animals soon discovered that mutual care and love between males and females, driven by the need to protect and nurture shared offspring, yielded significant benefits. Thus, the instinct for intersexual love began to take shape.  

Later, certain three-dimensional life forms rediscovered the advantages of intra-species cooperation. For example, social hymenopterans like ants and bees early on realized that division of labor among individuals conferred immense survival advantages, evolving directly into eusocial organisms—purely collectivist life forms. Their stories of self-sacrifice for the collective have endured through time. In another evolutionary branch, mammals independently uncovered this principle. Initially adopting Tit-for-Tatism, mammals, leveraging their ability to recognize individuals, evolved instincts for gratitude, fostering a tendency toward mutual aid in group cooperation. Most mammals are social animals, and instincts for sympathy, mutual assistance, affection, and gratitude began to awaken. One particularly successful lineage was the Delphinidae. Sympathy, mutual aid, affection, and gratitude are not exclusive to humans; they are also common among dolphins and orcas, embodying the basic survival philosophy of advanced intelligent life. We have previously recounted numerous instances of mutual cooperation between humans and dolphins/orcas. Here, we add a story of an orca trapped in a buoy rope: the orca pod sought human help, and after being freed, the rescued orca caught a devil fish to thank the humans. The entire pod then escorted the humans back to shore, slapping the water with their tails as a gesture of gratitude. This story reflects several traits unique to higher-dimensional life: mutual aid among orcas, reverence for elders, gratitude toward humans, and collective appreciation (not just the rescued individual). They function as a cohesive whole, their advanced emotions strikingly similar to those of humans. [No wonder they became oceanic hegemons without relying on tools—a factor often mistakenly credited as humanity’s key to success.]

</p>  

Another mammalian branch, primates, also thrived. Compared to other mammals, primates better understood the importance of cooperation, with group-based collaboration becoming their foundational survival unit. At this stage, virtuous thoughts representative of four-dimensional consciousness further took root in human instincts. Eventually, humanity’s independent evolutionary lineage emerged, choosing to pursue cooperation to its extreme. Humans abandoned the convenience of quadrupedalism, bearing the survival burden of a large brain, and underwent key evolutionary milestones: bipedalism, brain development, language, and writing. [The most critical evolutionary milestone—unseen in fossil records—was the emergence of transindividual love and the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection Instinct, the origin of virtue. Human society at this stage was infused with love, sympathy, loyalty, trust, unity, responsibility, and deep affection among individuals, marking the initial completion of humanity’s four-dimensional awakening.]

[In truth, all macroscopic capabilities in the living world are fundamentally macroscopic manifestations of the cooperative and virtuous capacities of lower-dimensional life forms. Recognizing this, it is hard not to be awed by the grandeur of life.]  

### The Human Edenic Period  
I have repeatedly referenced the Human Edenic Period. This era is not confined to a specific region or fixed time; it is a phase that nascent human races and groups universally experience at their origins. [A defining characteristic of this period is the initial formation of the Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection Instinct.]  

In an age of rampant predators and icy wastelands, human groups were scattered, with most members of a group sharing kinship. Only cohesive, brave, and virtuous groups survived. During this time, skills in tool use and energy-intensive large brains—detrimental to individual survival—flourished under the protection of Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejection individuals. High levels of intra-group cooperation were critical: groups with hypocritical Grabbingist mutants quickly perished due to internal depletion. In the Edenic Period, one could assume the best of others with great goodwill and respect. The common enemies were colossal beasts and less cooperative foreign groups. It was a beautiful era, with revered ancestral legends, comrades willing to sacrifice for one another, unwavering love, and chivalrous heroes. Mutual giving was a joy; loyalty was a source of pride; punishing evil was a pleasure. Humans lived in such an era, on and off, for tens of thousands of years, leaving genetic memories. Epic tales of heroism, the satisfaction of punishing vice, idyllic lives akin to the Peach Blossom Spring, and utopian social ideals all trace their origins to these genetic memories.  

Even into the early Spring and Autumn Period, the Zhou people remained in the twilight of the Human Edenic Period. Duke of Zhou’s decrees and his treatment of the Shang remnants reflect the universal love of that era. Countless individuals, including Confucius and Laozi, longed for Zhou-era life well into the Spring and Autumn Period. Confucius advocated reviving the Rites of Zhou, while Laozi championed "Small States with Small Populations"—both rooted in these genetic memories. Traces of the Edenic Period persisted even in the Spring and Autumn Period, manifesting in a culture that valued promises, chivalry, rules, and honorable victory in warfare.

With humanity reaping enormous Cooperative Dividends from collaboration, humankind swiftly vanquished all other once-dominant megafauna on Earth, ultimately asserting dominance over the planet. Since human success stemmed from cooperation, it naturally gave rise to a high-dimensional awareness of universal interconnectedness and grand cooperation—an understanding that all things possess vitality and are bound together. Over ten millennia, humans domesticated plants and animals, gradually transitioning from destructive apex predators of the food chain to stewards of a self-consistent life cycle. Had humanity been a purely grabbing, non-creative species, it could never have flourished. For instance, if humans had only foraged and hunted without developing agriculture and animal husbandry, they would have inevitably turned vast regions into deserts, rendering survival impossible for future generations.  
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f20b341-6f5f-4ba6-b6b6-b1ed4ee571eb" />  
</p>  
As humanity progresses toward the Fourth Dimension, it simultaneously transforms its Third-Dimensional evil instincts. Primitive urges—savagery, brutality, bloodlust, belligerence, and self-serving greed—are profoundly reshaped. Groups, clans, or states that retain more of these instincts are inevitably defeated by those that are more united, orderly, mutually supportive, and courageous. To better preserve virtuous instincts, humans later devised Virtue Selection institutions such as religion, law, and market economies, significantly elevating civilizational standards.  

### The Tortuous Path of Dimensional Ascension  
With humanity’s monumental success, the gradual overcoming of all natural predators, and the rise of agrarian civilizations, human settlements grew ever larger. This expansion created fertile ground for a deeper, more insidious evil: Hypocrisyism. A novel form of evil, it exploits the majority’s virtue—deceiving through others’ love, taking advantage through unequal contributions. Unlike overt grabbing, it evades punishment by Virtue Selection while achieving its exploitative ends, making it far more pernicious. [Craftiness, aiding tyranny, duplicity, ingratitude, and betrayal are quintessential manifestations of this evil, whose nature has slowly infiltrated humanity.]()  
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6eba4a3-fbad-4fae-abb5-3c7ed605978c" />  
</p>  
<p align="center">The process of human nature’s evolution aligns closely with the results of simulated programs.</p>  

As human societies expanded, massive settlements emerged, followed by states and city-states. During the Axial Age, challenges of governing large urban centers and resolving conflicts between city-states became prominent worldwide. This spurred the germination of ideas for ascending to higher dimensions, giving rise to diverse forms of collectivism. Concepts like Plato’s *Republic* and the Great Unity (Datong) ideal epitomize such aspirations. Subsequently, intensifying competition between groups made Group Grabbingism a critical factor in shaping human nature. Later Legalist thought and Machiavellianism emerged from the continued fermentation of these dynamics. The formation of humanity’s higher-dimensional instincts remains unconsolidated to this day, while the threat of Dimensional Collapse looms large.  
<p align="center"><img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa46ec06-efc2-430d-bbee-4c18da678185" /></p>  

Humanity’s Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanisms and Group Selection mechanisms impose strong evolutionary pressure toward virtue. Yet, when these mechanisms fail, evil resurges without hesitation—much as water seeks the lowest path, grabbing tendencies permeate all gaps, and new forms of evil continue to evolve. Moreover, even for individuals with fixed genetic predispositions, tendencies toward virtue or evil are influenced by culture and environment—[humans tend to act virtuously in virtuous groups and evilly in evil groups, a strategy honed by Adversarial Evolution]()—because such adaptability enhances survival. Thus, human nature cannot be simplistically labeled “innately good” or “innately evil.” It is a profound interweaving of Virtue and Evil, though overall, humanity leans toward virtue compared to other species. [Most humans are far kinder than most non-humans, an undeniable fact. Yet within humanity lies a facet more evil than Third-Dimensional animality: the evil of Hypocrisyism.]() Most Third-Dimensional life lacks Virtue-Upholding and Evil-Rejectionism mechanisms, making hypocrisy unnecessary. However, uniquely human evils—ingratitude, betrayal, moral blackmail, and PUA—are the most short-sighted and destructive. Like tumors, they kill Fourth-Dimensional life and themselves alike, propagating wildly before decaying alongside their host—a “foolish” and detestable instinct. The evil of Hypocrisyism surpasses that of grabbing: Third-Dimensional grabbing, though driven by individual strength, contributes to the evolution of Second-Dimensional cooperation, whereas Hypocrisyism is a parasite of Fourth-Dimensional life [neither enhancing Second-Dimensional cooperation nor improving individual fitness, but merely wasting and destroying evolutionary resources].()  

Understanding humanity’s entire evolutionary journey grants deeper insight into human nature. [To see only innate goodness is naïve; to see only innate evil or profit-seeking is superficial. Through the complexity of human nature, we observe overt hypocrisy, hidden evil impulses, and traces of profound virtue—manifestations corresponding to different stages of Adversarial Evolution, as wondrous as an embryo replaying the course of evolution.]()  
<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9cb0d0-1627-4401-a298-431bc71c9fab" /></p>  
<p align="center">Human nature encompasses the full evolutionary process of animality; the sole difference lies in its final, divine dimension.</p>  

Many claim society has two faces. I argue it has three, corresponding to three aspects of human nature: hypocrisy, indulgence of desire, and—most importantly—the aspect that makes humanity human. This third aspect is neither as sanctimonious as hypocrisy nor as base as indulgence; it is the truest essence of humanity. Though the proportion of these aspects varies among individuals:  
- The first aspect comprises simplified group rules that seem logical but are riddled with loopholes. Lacking better theories to refine them, society endures their flaws.  
- The second aspect is humanity’s residual Third-Dimensional instincts and remnants of an era of excessive individual competition.  
- The third aspect is humanity’s inner moral compass—a complex force indescribable in simplicity. [It is not necessarily selfless; it may not align with universal ideals of perfection. Yet, forged through countless trials of Group Selection and Individual Selection, it balances group interests with the long-term benefits of individual contributions to the group, ultimately fostering higher-dimensional awareness. This is true Virtue, though it may sometimes resemble evil.]()  

## Is Human Nature Malleable?  
### The Awakening to Virtue  
Whether framing human nature as innately good or evil is overly absolute. Humanity differs drastically from other animals in its malleability; unlike most creatures governed by conditioned reflexes, humans are not bound by rigid instincts. At birth, humans are like computer programs with some preloaded data—both the program and data are modifiable to a degree. [“Innate Virtue and Evil” describe not only the initial state of these programs and data but also their potential to incline toward virtue or evil. Some programs/data, though initially marked by minor evil, may transform into great virtue through education and self-reflection; others, though initially virtuous, may fall into extreme evil under the sway of desire.]()[Generally, wiser, more far-sighted individuals are better able to awaken to virtue.]()  

Thus, while emphasizing genetic instincts, we must not neglect the plasticity bestowed by humanity’s advanced brain—a fundamental distinction from animals. A truly evil person is one whose innate evil is unteachable and unchangeable; those with minor evil who can be guided, reflect, and correct their instincts through reason, ultimately turning from evil to virtue, may be considered innately good. Countless examples exist: Mencius’ mother cutting the loom to educate the “Second Sage” of Confucianism; Mother Yue inscribing “Serve the Country with Loyalty” on Yue Fei’s back to forge a hero; and Dou Yanshan of the Later Jin Dynasty.  

Dou Yanshan was born into wealth but possessed a low moral character in his youth. He bullied the weak, monopolized markets, and cheated in business—using small measures when lending grain to the poor and large ones when collecting, small scales when selling and large ones when buying. Though he amassed great wealth, he remained childless until age thirty, consumed by anxiety. One night, his deceased father appeared in a dream, warning: “Your heart is unrighteous, your virtue corrupt, and your infamy widespread. If you do not reform, you will not only remain childless but also meet an early death. Repent swiftly, accumulate great virtue, and act with benevolence—only then may you reverse your fate.”  

Dou awoke trembling, vowing to abandon evil and embrace virtue. He established free schools, performed good deeds, and prioritized others’ needs. Later, his grandfather appeared in another dream: “Over the years, you have done much good. Heaven, recognizing your great virtue, has extended your lifespan by three cycles and granted you five noble sons, who will achieve distinction. Upon your passing, you shall ascend to heaven.” His grandfather added: [“The principle of cause and effect is unassailable. The rewards of virtue and punishment of evil manifest in this life, the next, or through one’s descendants. Heaven’s net, though vast, misses nothing—there is no doubt.”]()

One night, he dreamt again of his father saying to him: "You have accumulated great virtue now. In the future, five of your sons will pass the imperial examinations, and you will live to be eighty-nine years old." After waking, he redoubled his efforts in practicing virtue. Later, his wife indeed bore five sons, whom he named Yi, Yan, Kan, Er, and Xi. Thereafter, he dedicated all his energy to their upbringing—attending to their health, fostering their studies, and cultivating their moral character. Under his guidance, all five sons grew into capable men, successively passing the imperial examinations. Later generations referred to this as the "Five Sons Achieving Scholarly Success." The eldest became Minister of Rites, the second Vice Minister of Rites, and the remaining three also held official posts. When a vice minister named Feng Dao heard of this, he composed a poem: "Dou the Tenth of Yanshan taught his sons with righteous methods. One ancient tree (himself) stands strong, while five osmanthus branches (his sons) bloom fragrantly."  

Dou Yanshan exemplifies the self-awakening toward Virtue. Though his story invokes a supernatural dream, such tales often serve as metaphors for personal realization. While Evil may yield temporary gains, it will ultimately harm future generations. For the "intelligent" human genes, self-awakening is often possible. The evolutionary logic here is straightforward: if wealth is acquired through Hypocrisyism and Grabbingism, descendants will amplify these behaviors. In the short term, this leads to familial discord; in the long term, it fuels internal strife within the nation. The consequences range from family ruin to national collapse, resulting not only in the extinction of one’s own genes but also endangering kinship genes. Many imperial families that introduced malicious Hypocrisyism genes have suffered such fates, which is why prominent lineages must guard against such genetic infiltration.  

[Once Hypocrisyism genes infiltrate, a distinguished status acts like a "grabbing amplifier." To maximize gains, descendants turn against siblings, leaving only those adept at flattering superiors and internal strife—incapable of constructive work. Though they wield power, they face betrayal and isolation, ultimately precipitating national disasters.]  

If most people adopt the attitude, "Let the flood come after I die," the flood will likely arrive long before their death. Take Hu Hai, who once declared, "Life in this world is like racing six fine horses through a narrow crevice"—emphasizing hedonism. His life was indeed short, and the Qin Dynasty’s reign was equally brief. Thus, those with sufficient reason, wisdom, and foresight often grasp such consequences, even if not inherently virtuous. Stubborn Grabbingists, however, are typically narcissistic, obstinate, and envious individuals with personality disorders. They apply double standards, resist understanding cooperative win-win principles, and ignore others’ injustices. Though their genes will eventually face retribution, future generations of "them" will endure large-scale oppression—evident in eras like the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, and the Nanjing Massacre. The sufferings, injustices, and humiliations we face today stem from the "stupidity" and "short-sightedness" of our genes over millennia. My realization of my genes’ past "stupidity"—failing to distinguish Virtue from Evil and enforce karmic justice—explains my present hardships. Hence, in this life, I have awoken and strive to write this book to atone. This reflects the selfish yet shrewd nature of genes.  

Some, however, choose the opposite path—awakening to Evil. They justify their actions with maxims like "He who does not seek his own gain will perish" and "Survival of the Fittest," finding temporary solace. Their genes will endure endless suffering for this folly.  

### Unmalleable Instinctual Evil  
We may trust that most people’s Virtue and Evil are malleable, but we cannot deny the existence of individuals with deeply ingrained Evil. Some Evil runs in their bones; some deception comes naturally. Worse, some adeptly manipulate others’ emotions—known as Dark Empathetic Personalities. Charles Manson, a nightmare for generations of Americans, is such an example. By studying aphorisms, religious texts, biographies, and wisdom literature, he exploited human weaknesses. A quote attributed to Carnegie (actually Freud) profoundly influenced him: "Everything you or I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great." Driven by his innate Evil, Manson used his talents and knowledge to orchestrate cult-like brainwashing, perpetrating some of America’s most heinous crimes.  

Thankfully, most human nature is malleable, but true "devils" exist. They pursue boundless freedom and desire—distinguished from "angels" by their pursuit of individual freedom at the expense of others’ and their selfish desires conflicting fundamentally with others’. Their nature is so extreme as to be pathological; perhaps release, in some form, is the greatest mercy for them and their genes.  

### Genetic Determinism?  
Readers may now think this book espouses Genetic Determinism. First, Genetic Determinism is flawed, and this book rejects it—just as we acknowledge human malleability, we recognize most people’s nature is adaptable. However, we must admit that genes directly or indirectly influence behavior, often subtly and over time. Even minor genetic differences can produce vastly different behavioral patterns or life histories, regardless of how unsettling this may seem (though this book shows such fears are unfounded). Countless histories prove humanity thrives only through truth-seeking. Cultural Determinism, like Confucian exhortations to Virtue, ultimately does more harm than good. A sophisticated, high-dimensional life form’s key ability is to prevent its "cells" (genes) from degenerating into Grabbingism or cancer—whether through immune systems, anti-cancer mechanisms, laws, or markets.  

### Instinctual Virtue and Rational Virtue  
Instinctual Virtue and Rational Virtue correspond to innate and acquired Virtue. Innate Virtue is the initial state; acquired Virtue builds upon it. Top designers of social order must possess both instinctual Virtue and profound rationality, understanding the ultimate Adversarial Evolutionary definition of Virtue: "[Behavioral patterns that probabilistically benefit the long-term survival of high-dimensional life communities, i.e., benefit the persistence of Virtue genes or their forms—a life form of ultimate self-consistency]."  

Instincts, limited by history and era, must evolve with changing environments. [If we avoid letting brutal group selection drive instinctual evolution, rationality becomes the sole guide for upgrading instincts.]  

Humanity’s ideal Cooperation Maintenance System requires "double-virtuous" elites as leaders and policymakers (Platonic "philosopher-kings"). Those with instinctual Virtue but limited rationality may serve as supervisors; those with rational Virtue but weaker instincts as executors. Finally, individuals lacking both instinct and reason must contribute their social value under structured constraints to avoid Evil.
