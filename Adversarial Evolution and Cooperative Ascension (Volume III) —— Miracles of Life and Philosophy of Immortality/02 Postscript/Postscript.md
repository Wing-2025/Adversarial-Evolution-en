# Postscript  

I suspect many share my perplexity. Humans, who have long dominated Earth and stand at the apex of the food chain, have mastered the ability to traverse skies and depths, to comprehend the past and present, to observe the minutest details and fathom the grandest cosmic vistas. They manipulate knobs to control all living things for their use, press buttons to annihilate worlds, and vanquish foes from a thousand miles away without a trace of dust. It seems there is nothing that can stump humanity anymore. With current technological capabilities, every individual could theoretically live well—clothed, fed, provided for in youth, and cared for in old age.

Yet the reality diverges starkly from this ideal. Human society still grapples with inherent inequities, irreconcilable contradictions, recurring conflicts, deceitful and calculating maneuvers, entangled grudges, historical grievances, disorienting perplexity, and undercurrents of crisis. Of course, I do not doubt that this is a beautiful era—by some measures, the best in human history. But by any standard, given the material prosperity supported by current technology, human society should be more harmonious, conflicts should be more easily resolved, and humanity should be happier and more virtuous. We cannot help but ask: What has eroded the "happiness" index of human society? What has trapped us in the quagmire of "involution"? What has made us "mediocre" without realizing our value? What drives us to scramble for success yet fail to achieve good outcomes? What is the meaning of life? What is humanity’s mission?  

As religion and theology have faded, and humanity has descended from its "divine pedestal," the natural law of "Survival of the Fittest" has gradually filled the void of "ultimate meaning," becoming the theoretical basis for explaining social phenomena. The "ghost" of progressivism, riding the momentum of evolutionary theory, has seeped into every domain. Corporate missions are framed as "maximizing shareholder value"; Wall Street proclaims "greed is good"; humanity’s ultimate pursuit is individual "success" and "freedom." Reduced to "primitives" by evolutionary theory, humans seem no different from birds and beasts. They can no longer believe in ideals, convictions, or distant aspirations; they can scarcely speak of human value, meaning, or mission. All this feels like a self-deceiving fable of a bygone world.

Adrift in this fog, people once again seek new "value compasses": "Science and technology are the primary productive force"; some even argue, "As long as science and technology continue to advance, humanity will surely have a bright future... This single condition suffices." Meanwhile, a new "pride" has emerged: the human brain and intelligence are considered the fundamental traits distinguishing humans from animals, with intelligence hailed as the root cause of humanity’s success as a species. However, the layered reasoning in this book reveals that these assertions diverge sharply from reality. Eugenics, which elevates intelligence as the standard, indirectly contributed to the tragedies of World War II.  

Against the backdrop of rapid, breathtaking technological advancement, are humanity’s spiritual realms developing healthily? Is there balance between the progress of science/technology and morality? Are the crises we face diminishing? The double-edged sword of science and technology remains firmly in human hands; humanity’s ultimate trajectory depends more on itself. The sharper this sword, the greater the risk that an immature human mind may harm or even destroy itself. Science wields immense power, but the light of science alone cannot guide humanity beyond large-scale evolutionary laws. If science and technology represent a great force, then humanity’s morality and its Cooperation Maintenance Mechanism determine the direction of this force: toward Virtue or Hypocrisyism? Directed outward or inward? It all hinges on a single choice.  

What is more unsettling is the growing evidence that we may be frogs in gradually heating water, "sweetly" approaching demise like past Earthly dominators. Latent negative factors are quietly accumulating; Pandora’s box has been opened. What is it? The decline of Virtue Selection? The spread of Hypocrisyism? Sexual Selection Reversal? Group Grabbingism? Most remain unaware.  

Throughout human history, even empires and dynasties with technology far surpassing their neighbors—and leaving all other species in the dust—have almost invariably succumbed to the Law of Historical Cycles, where prosperity peaks and then wanes. If humanity fails to grasp its underlying patterns, this law will continue to repeat itself in cruelly unrelenting ways. In times of ascent, there is joy, splendor, and flourishing; in decline, ruins, suffering, and carnage.

Humanity’s adversary is not other species, nor even natural laws, but our own "kin"—those bound to us by blood and shared fate—and our own "selves." Thus, understanding the human species, human nature, humanity’s origins, value, and meaning, and further comprehending the evolutionary pitfalls of human society and civilization, is of utmost importance! Only through such understanding can we pierce the fog, see the essence of social and historical evolution—and even the evolution of human civilization. Only then can we act with prudence, avoiding beautifully camouflaged pitfalls; escape the cycles of millennia-long suffering; and come closer to discerning what is right or wrong, good or bad, truly beneficial, or destined to become our future nightmare. Ultimately, we can grasp humanity’s true mission and find a foundation to ponder: Where should humanity go?
