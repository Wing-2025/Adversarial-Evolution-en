# Creative Background  

In recent years, human science and technology have made remarkable progress, entering an era of technological singularity. However, our spiritual civilization and sense of well-being have deteriorated. Anxiety and feelings of emptiness have increased rather than decreased, with negative factors accumulating covertly and the laws of rise and fall quietly repeating...  


# Series of Books on Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension  

*Adversarial Evolution and Cooperative Ascension* greatly simplifies the understanding of critical events and key nodes in billions of years of life evolution and thousands of years of human social change. This includes the emergence of eukaryotic life, the formation of multicellular organisms (the secret of the Cambrian period), the rise of social animals, the origin of humans, and the development of human society.  

It helps to understand the essence of significant phenomena in human society, including religion, law, and market economy. The rise and fall of nations, the fate of empires, and the survival of human civilizations can all be explained through this framework.  

This theoretical framework provides a unified and self-consistent explanation for:  
- The evolutionary trajectory of life over billions of years,  
- The secrets behind the rapid rise of the human lineage over millions of years,  
- The process of rapid transformation, decline, and rebirth of human societies over thousands of years.  

By mastering this theory, you can gain a clearer understanding than ever before of the underlying logic and essence of the living world, human society, and the evolution of all things.  

Moreover, this theory is not only macrocosmic in perspective but also deeply relevant to our social lives. It contains the true "success philosophy" for humans as one of the most representative life forms. Only when humanity deeply understands this theory can we better grasp our future destiny.  

- Why do we enjoy technological prosperity yet live such difficult lives?  
- Why are we trapped in involution without creating value?  
- Why do we付出 (sacrifice) so much but gain so little?  
- Why is it so hard to find a partner in love, while处处 (everywhere) we encounter pitfalls and live in fear?  
- Why do we become the people we hate?  

All these questions find answers here. The theory also contains solutions to many problems in biology, sociology, anthropology, and even politics and philosophy. It explains the unified evolutionary laws and trends underlying sciences of different scales. Among the various theories proposed in this book, the methods of cross-dimensional self-similarity and cross-dimensional analogy are particularly important. They provide a telescope for observing distant futures, allowing humanity to prepare for challenges in advance; they also illuminate and guide humanity's path forward like a lighthouse.  

This fundamental, root-cause-oriented theory is destined to be esoteric and difficult to disseminate. However, to solve the problems of human society fundamentally, a piecemeal approach ("treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it aches") will not suffice. The more short-sighted and eager for quick gains we are, the more counterproductive the results will be. Thus, some knowledge and experiences lead to greater loss the more they are learned, and the more people know them, the more exhausted everyone becomes. The theory of adversarial evolution, however, is the opposite: one person's knowledge may not change much, but the more people learn and understand it, the easier life will become, the more meaningful life will be, and the better society will be.
